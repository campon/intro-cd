         "David Perdue: (00:01)\nHow great is it to be back in Macon, Georgia with Donald Trump coming to Macon again? I want to thank Governor Kemp because he laid it out just now, but let me remind you of something that happened in 2002. Sunny just mentioned it. Because of you, we turned this thing around, and for the last 18 years, we have built a state that’s now the number one state in the country in which to do business.\nDavid Perdue: (00:25)\nThat did not happen by accident. Brian Kemp is the third governor in a row that understands how to do that. And thanks to you, that’s going to continue. Today, we have an opportunity. Every generation has an opportunity like this. They have their moment of crisis. With Donald Trump, it’s all about promises made and promises delivered. After eight years of Joe Biden, you hear Joe lately? Joe said the other day, he said, “Oh yeah, you guys were enjoying that economic Renaissance because of what we did with Barack Obama.”\nDavid Perdue: (01:06)\nNow guys, I’m just a dumb business guy for right over that hill, right there, and I can tell you, that is a lie right out of the pit of hell. Donald Trump, after eight years of Barack Obama and Joe Biden giving us the lowest economic output in U.S. history, and we felt that right here in Georgia, Donald Trump gave us the best economic turnaround in U.S. history, y’all.\nDavid Perdue: (01:36)\nSeven and a half million new jobs, highest middle class income ever measured, the lowest unemployment for African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanics ever measured. After 800,000 people, under Barack Obama, fell into poverty, under Donald Trump, six and a half million people have lifted themselves out of poverty, y’all. Now that’s America.\nDavid Perdue: (01:57)\nBut it took Donald Trump, not the bureaucrats in Washington, not some career politician, but it took Donald Trump to build that wall. It took Donald Trump to move that embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It took Donald Trump to name 200 new federal judges, including Neil Gorsich and Brett Kavanaugh. And next week, we will know that we will confirm Amy Cony Barrett. Mark my words.\nDavid Perdue: (02:43)\nIt’s one thing to stand up here and cheer. It’s one thing to stand up and remind everybody. This guy is providential. He didn’t happen by accident. How in the world, in our political system, could Donald J. Trump come on the scene in 2016 and do what he did? Tell me. But God’s watching. He’s watching what we’re going to do right now. What’s at stake is this, and I mean this: It’s our time to stand up to the socialist movement that for the last 100 years has been trying to take over our beloved America.\nDavid Perdue: (03:27)\nIt didn’t just start in the ’30s. It started long ago, but they believe they have it in their grasp now. They believe these CNN polls and CNBC polls. Oh, let me tell you, they don’t know the big red poll right here. But this is what I believe is a stake. Mark my words. They believe this. That if they get the majority of the Senate and they win the White House, Joe Biden has already said, your taxes are going up, guys.\nDavid Perdue: (03:56)\nHe’s already said. You know those regulations that those mean old demonic Republicans, all those regulations you pulled back, we’re going to give it back to you. You know that healthcare that we screwed up? We’re going to do it again. But most importantly, guys, they want to stack the Supreme Court. Did you see that? They want to stack the Supreme Court. Now what President Trump has done is brought balance back to the Supreme Court. These aren’t activists. These are constitutionalists. They’re up there to protect you and me.\nDavid Perdue: (04:32)\nBut the most insidious thing that Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden are trying to perpetrate, and Bernie and Elizabeth and Kamala, or what? Kamala or Kamala or Kamala mala mala, I don’t know. Whatever. They’re trying to perpetrate a lie, and that is that socialism, this radical socialism that they’re trying to sell us, is better than our beloved democracy. We’re not going to let that stand.\nDavid Perdue: (04:57)\nAnd here’s how they’re going to do it. You stack the courts, you change the voting rules in the Senate, and pretty soon you start adding democratic states. You get rid of the electoral college or change it like they can do, and pretty soon you’re talking about a one-party state, guys. That failed in Russia in 1917, it failed in Cuba in 1959, Venezuela today. You can’t find a country in the world where that has ever worked.\nDavid Perdue: (05:19)\nNow why in the world would we ever go down that road, particularly after the last 75 years in this country where God has blessed us so greatly that we can come out today and say what we want independent of what that media says? I need you to do one thing. Stand with me, stand with our President, and let’s make damn sure that the road to socialism never runs through the state of Georgia. God bless you guys.",

         "Joe Biden: (00:00)\nHello, Michigan. Hi, how are you? What’s your name? Sam, good to see you, man. Thanks for being here. I appreciate it. Alexia, thank you for taking the time telling your story, it’s important. Unfortunately, there are an awful lot of stories like yours all over America as I travel the country, too many, it don’t have to be. And, folks, it’s great to be back, it’s great to be here.\nJoe Biden: (00:39)\nThere’s not a better governor in the United States of America than Gretchen Whitmer, that’s a fact. I’ve met virtually all of them. And Gary, we badly need you back in the United States Senate, pal, we badly need you back in the United States Senate. And then my sister, Debbie Stabenow. God love you, Debbie. We worked so closely together for so long and as vice-president as well.\nJoe Biden: (01:13)\nFolks, look, we need to send Gary back to another term. Standing up for Michigan, Michigan families, small businesses. He was our main congressional partner back in 2010 when we passed the critical legislation supporting small businesses. I remember the president gave me the responsibility to go out and round up support. My go-to guy to get it done, I mean it sincerely was Gary. He was the go-to guy and he always shows up and he always shows up for Michigan.\nJoe Biden: (01:51)\nAnd like all of you, Jill and I are so grateful that the governor and her family are safe. It’s an unusual year. Governor you’ve been through a lot but my Lord, you are a leader. You stand up straight and tall and you don’t bend. Governor, it’s not easy to lead in moments of crisis but that’s a determination of whether you are a real leader when you stepped up to the crisis and you’ve stepped up, you’ve done it and you keep doing it.\nJoe Biden: (02:18)\nAnd as I said a moment ago you’re pretty much doing it better than anybody else in the whole United States of America. You’ve shown this whole nation just how tough and thoughtful you are, tough just like Michigan. I’ve got to believe this state has to be so proud of you. I know personally I am as I’ve gotten to know you and proud to call your friend, gov.\nJoe Biden: (02:45)\nWe’re grateful to the FBI and law enforcement to discover these domestic terrorists and stop them. And make no mistake, that’s who they are, domestic terrorists, flat terrorists. Planning to blow up a bridge on American soil, to threaten the lives of police officers, to kidnap an elected later and now we’re finding out the same thing was happening in Virginia. It’s the sort of behavior you might expect from ISIS and it should shock the conscious of every American, every American. And the failure to condemn these folks is stunning from the outset. I remember it matters. You’ve heard me say it before, “Words matter.” And the words of a president particularly matter. When the president tweeted, “Liberate Michigan, liberate Michigan,” that’s the call that was heard, that was the dog whistle. Just like when he said, “Very fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.” Fathers, they came out of the fields carrying torches, their veins bulging, shouting antisemitic bile, carrying Nazi flags accompanied by the Klu Klux Klan.\nJoe Biden: (04:10)\nBut when a young woman was killed protesting the president was asked what he think and he said something no president has ever, ever, ever, ever heard, “There were very fine people on both sides.” Those words were heard just like when he stood on the debate stage with me and refused to denounce white supremacists but told that white ring extremist group to “stand back and stand by.” Stand back and stand by, an American president? Not only shocked us but it stunned the world. Those words we heard.\nJoe Biden: (05:09)\nYou know the reason I decided to run for president and I know that Debbie knows this. I hadn’t planned on running ever again after my son died. But when I saw those folks coming out of those woods I thought, “How in God’s name, how in God’s name can I remain silent?” And I said at the time it was somewhat not criticized but people didn’t think it was… Well, I don’t know what it was. When I said, “I think we’re in a battle for the soul of America,” I think we are.\nJoe Biden: (05:47)\nWhat I saw at Charlottesville and the president’s response to it is why I went to Gettysburg Battlefield of Pennsylvania last week. Because I thought there was need to stand up to hate in America and urge as Lincoln did to come together as a nation. Well, I’ve learned hate never goes away, it only hides. It never goes away, and if you’re given oxygen it comes out from one of the rocks, it grows. We need to be clear from the president going down in this country, there is no place for hate in America, period, none, it will not be tolerated.\nJoe Biden: (06:37)\nBut President Trump revels in division and chaos to do anything to distract us from focusing on his failures to deal with this virus and to protect the nation. He’s still living in a dream world. He keeps telling us that this virus is going to disappear like America. He said, I think last night in his town hall, I didn’t have the pleasure of hearing it, I was doing one myself. He said, “We have turned the corner.” And my grandfather was sitting in my chair where he said, “He’s gone around the bunny.”\nJoe Biden: (07:24)\nTurned the corner? My Lord. It’s not disappearing, in fact it’s on the rise again. It’s getting worse as predicted. And we all know the terrible price this nation has paid. Lives lost, unemployment way up, across Michigan and the country folks are worried about making their next rent payment and mortgage payment. Or their healthcare will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic that you worked so damn hard, Gary, to keep. Worried about…\nJoe Biden: (08:01)\nAnd we talked about this, Alexia. Kids in school, are they able to get back to school? More than 215,000 Americans, I think it’s 217 as of this morning, Americans have died from COVID-19. And experts have said, and I’ve been saying for the last month and a half that nearly another 200,000 lives are likely to be lost in the coming months between now and the first of the year if we continue to refuse to follow science. Because he refused to embracing wearing a mask, how many times on television have you seen him make fun of Biden wearing a mask? Because he refuses to practice social distancing he puts his supporters in such jeopardy. It’s estimated…\nJoe Biden: (09:01)\nIt’s estimated by his own folks, if we just wore masks nationally, almost 100,000 lives would be saved in the next few months. His own director of CDC said while we’re waiting for a vaccine, even if we had a vaccine, this will prevent more deaths between now and the end of January than a vaccine would. Know what’s really sad about all this? And I’ve been talking about this, but every time I repeat it, I get more… Well, I’m not very happy.\nJoe Biden: (09:49)\nThe president knew and lied about knowing. He knew in January. The intelligence community and what they call the PDB, the Presidential Daily Briefings, which I’ve sat in on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them as vice-president. It got out that they laid out in detail to him how devastating this could be, how much life could be lost, and so on. He said he was unaware of it. Didn’t read those reports. Well, that surprised no one, he didn’t read the reports, but he didn’t read the reports. And everybody said, “Well, maybe he didn’t.”\nJoe Biden: (10:38)\nBut then as was acknowledged because of his ego, he wanted to impress a famous journalist, he thought he could change his mind about his view of him, he did a long interview with Bob Woodward. Bob Woodward, a renowned journalist, taped the interview with him, extensive interviews, hours. And he taped an interview where Trump said he knew this disease was deadly, significantly worse than the flu. But that’s not what he told you. That’s not what he told the public.\nJoe Biden: (11:25)\nAnd the reason he lied again to the American people? Well, he said he didn’t want to panic the American people. Americans don’t panic. Donald Trump panicked. That’s who panicked. As a consequence of his overwhelming lying, negligence, and irresponsible action, how many empty chairs were around the kitchen table this morning or the dining room table last night? How many? How many women or men leaned over when they got in bed last night and reached over to touch their husband and wife, and they weren’t there? You all know what loss is. It’s profound, especially when it was avoidable, much of it.\nJoe Biden: (12:29)\nBut mishandling the pandemic isn’t enough for Trump. On top of that, he’s still trying to take away your healthcare. Trump’s still determined in the midst of this pandemic. And by the way, if projections… Pray, God, they’re not right, Father. But if they’re right, though, in the next several months, there’ll be over 200,000 additional deaths. That would be in one year 400,000 Americans would have died. That’s more than lost in all of World War II, hear me? World War II was four years. More American souls would have been lost than in World War II.\nJoe Biden: (13:20)\nWhat’s he doing? He’s still determined to destroy the Affordable Care Act. This isn’t hyperbole. Just like your opponent calls it a disaster. Talk about a disaster, there’s a disaster. The guy is 2000% or 200%, whatever it is with Trump. Hope everybody remembers. Look, as I said, this isn’t hyperbole. It’s real, as real as it gets. On November 10th the United States Supreme Court will hear the Trump administration make the case that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down in its entirety.\nJoe Biden: (14:05)\nI know everybody thinks they know, but I just want to remind you 10 million of you have already lost your health insurance because your employer’s health insurance, they’ve gone out of business. 10 million Americans already without health insurance. If Trump gets his way, 20 million more Americans will lose their health care. That’s God awful. In the midst of this God awful economic crisis, 100 million Americans will lose their protections for pre-existing conditions, including more than 4 million people right here in Michigan. Lifetime limits on benefits will be back.\nJoe Biden: (14:56)\nAnd by the way, a lot of you’ve been through what I’ve been through and worse. I can distinctly remember sitting on a bed with my Beau, my son, who came back from a year serving in Iraq, which this president talks about losers who serve, losers. With the same significant disease that your mom had, stage four glioblastoma. When it was diagnosed, when he got home, we asked the docs. It was only a matter of months, not if, just months. We never gave up hope. I remember watching him on that bed. He made it almost 16 months.\nJoe Biden: (16:11)\nToward the end, and this is not about me, it’s about all of you, I consciously thought to myself, what would it feel like if they were able to walk in and say, “Mr Biden, you’ve outrun your insurance coverage. Suffer the last two or three months in pain on your own. Lots of luck.” Because that’s what was happening before.\nJoe Biden: (16:49)\nInsurers, if they win, and that’s what this court packing going on now is about, insurers will no longer allow you to keep your kids on your policy till age 26 in the middle of this economic crisis. Women, once again, will be charged more for their healthcare just because they’re a woman. Older folks will be able to be charged more. And as the governor said, long-term complications from COVID will become pre-existing conditions, joining asthma, diabetes, even pregnancy is a preexisting condition before. It could allow insurers to jack up your premiums or deny coverage altogether.\nJoe Biden: (17:34)\nGetting rid of Obamacare is why they’re racing to get this nominee through the Supreme Court. Make no mistake about it. Trump’s made it clear from the beginning, as your opponent has. He wants to get rid of Obamacare in its entirety. And with this nominee, he’s made that incredibly clear, as well. Michigan deserves so much better. Deserves leaders like-\nJoe Biden: (18:03)\nMichigan deserves so much better, deserves leaders like Gary and Debbie Stabenow, public servants who lead with decency and honor, always look out for your needs, will think about how to ease the burden on your family.\nJoe Biden: (18:22)\nThat’s the sort of leader you’ve got in Gretchen, in Governor Whitmer, as well. When she was in the state senate, she led the charge to secure Obamacare Medicaid expansion for more than 800,000 Michiganders. Think about this now. Some of those States, Republican governors did not expand, even though the federal government was paying for it front end. There’s millions of people have no coverage.\nJoe Biden: (18:50)\nAfter we passed Obamacare with the help of Debbie and Gary, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, we were able to reduce the uninsured rate by 55% here in Michigan. And if I have the honor of becoming your president, we’ll build on the Affordable Care Act, no matter what they do.\nJoe Biden: (19:11)\nYou can choose to keep a private plan, if you still have one. Because some of the private plans negotiated, the UAW owners are good plans. But we’ll also offer you a Medicare like public health insurance option. It’ll force private insurers to keep premiums low and offer better coverage because, for the first time, they’ll have to compete for your business against a public insurer that doesn’t have the profit motive in mind.\nJoe Biden: (19:38)\nIf you choose this public option or a private plan will increase subsidies for your premiums, so that they’re lower. You can afford our plans with lower deductibles, lower out-of-pocket spending. An independent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. Not a liberal think tank, serious folks looking at this. Here’s the bottom line. My plan lowers healthcare costs and gets universal coverage quickly at a time when Michigan families desperately are going to need that relief and they need it now. Families are reeling right now. They need a lifeline now. I promise you. When I’m president I’ll take care of your health coverage, the same way I would my own family.\nJoe Biden: (20:29)\nI grew up like a lot of people in this state. In Scranton, Pennsylvania and Wilmington, Delaware in a three bedroom, split level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. I can remember how my dad, when we moved from Scranton for no work, we moved down to Delaware. He stayed with my grandpop for a year, he came home every weekend. Finally got a job. We got an apartment we lived in, and ended up being section eight housing years later, but it was decent. We were happy.\nJoe Biden: (20:59)\nIt took my dad about three years to get a job good enough that he could actually buy a home. And he bought that small home at the time a suburban sprawl was going on. There were 70 homes like it, three and four bedrooms homes. But the walls were thin. I look back and I wonder how my mom and dad did it, come to think of it. I remember one night, my dad, you could hear him restlessly rolling in bed. Our bedroom was next to it. And I asked my mom the next morning, what’s wrong with Dad? She said, “Honey, it’s complicated.” I said, “What’s the matter, Mom?” I was 14 years old. She said, “Well, his company just lost his health insurance. We’re going to be okay, honey.”\nJoe Biden: (21:42)\nThink of all the people rolling around in bed tonight, tomorrow night, last night. Trump doesn’t see things this way because he only sees the world from a Park Avenue perspective. I’m not being a wise guy, I’m being literal. He can only see from his penthouse, Wall Street.\nJoe Biden: (22:10)\nI see the world from where I grew up like many of you. I grew up in Scranton, as I said. My mom taught me. My mom had a backbone like a ramrod. My mom taught me. She said, “Joey, look at me, look at me.” Because I used to stutter. She said, “Nobody’s better than you, Joey, but everybody’s your equal.” That’s how I was raised.\nJoe Biden: (22:33)\nI think you and I, we measure people, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, we measure people on the strength of their character. Honesty, decency, recognizing that some things are bigger than just your self-interest. That’s what America is about. That’s who we are. It’s about family, respect, decency, honor, opportunity. Our families and yours, we weren’t asking for anything. Just a shot, just an even shot. Given a shot, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let their country down.\nJoe Biden: (23:13)\nThat’s what Michigan needs now, a shot to come back strong. That’s what you needed 10 years ago in your automobile industry, the heart and soul of Michigan was on the brink. My state used to be an auto state. Small population, we had the highest percentage of auto workers of any state in the nation because we had less than a million people. The largest General Motors and Chrysler plants outside of Michigan. But you all remember like I do. You remember what it was like yesterday.\nJoe Biden: (23:52)\nWhen Barack and I decided we had to bet on Michigan, remember all the blow back even from some Democrats. We can’t compete. We bet on auto workers, we bet on the UAW and they came through and it paid off. For real. The industry wasn’t in trouble because of the auto workers, it was in trouble because of management decisions. Over the objective of many, we stepped in and rescued the automobile industry, General Motors and Chrysler, saving over 1 million jobs by that one deal.\nJoe Biden: (24:36)\nDon’t ever underestimate the American worker. By contrast on Donald Trump’s watch, we were in a nationwide manufacturing recession before COVID struck. And we’re now down nearly 650,000 manufacturing jobs across the country now. Now, and it’s rising. In fact, Donald Trump will be the first president in modern American history to leave office, God willing, to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he started in office. Last one was Herbert Hoover. For real.\nJoe Biden: (25:19)\nFolks, we can bring this economy back. I’m positive of it. I’m optimistic about it. We know how to go about doing it. An independent analysis on Wall Street, Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, has done an in-depth analysis of every aspect of my plan, as well as his. You know what their conclusion was? This is Moody’s, now. That my plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his would, and $1 trillion more in economic growth than the president’s plan, by investing in people.\nJoe Biden: (26:09)\nBy the way, you see these ads here in Michigan, Biden’s going to raise your taxes. Once again, flat, unadulterated lie. No one who makes less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more. If you make more than that, you’re going to start paying at the rate you paid under the administration of George W. Bush at 39.6%. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the very wealthy to pay their fair share for a change. Trump’s more than $2 trillion tax cut, I’m going to roll back 1.5 trillion of that in the giveaways to the biggest companies in the top 1%. And the money we raise, we’ll invest in working people, in growing the middle class. And this time, make sure we bring everybody along, black, white, Hispanic-\nJoe Biden: (27:03)\nThis time, make sure we bring everybody along. Black, white, Hispanic, disabled. Everyone comes along. Outside economists said my plan will create millions of good paying union jobs in manufacturing. We’re going to invest in building more resilient infrastructure. Remember the president said, “I have an infrastructure plan.” In 2017, and then 2018 and 2019, now 2020. He doesn’t have any plan. I’m going to build a resilient infrastructure, creating good paying jobs. Building roads and bridges and ports. One million new jobs and affordable housing units. Should be one million new affordable housing units. High-speed broadband for every household. A 100 billion dollars to rebuild our crumbling schools. One of the reasons we can’t send our kids back to schools. A lot of them aren’t even safe now.\nJoe Biden: (28:03)\nWe’re going to retrofit as we started our administration when the president allowed me to run the recovery act. We’re going to retrofit four million buildings and weatherize two billion homes. That alone will save 100s of thousands of millions of barrels of oil. It’s all going to be done by certified union labor. I’m going to end Trump’s incentives. He talks about his trade deals. As Gary and Debbie know in his trade deals he incentivized people to send jobs abroad.\nJoe Biden: (28:47)\nAbroad. More taking their jobs overseas. One thing more the United States Government owns and maintains enormous fleet of vehicles. I promise you, the president controls that. I’m going to convert those government fleets into clean vehicles made of and sourced right here in the United States of America. I’m going to expand the capacity so the United States, not China leads the world in clean vehicle production.\nJoe Biden: (29:17)\nWe’re going to make it easier to America’s companies to switch from fuel inefficient vehicles. We’re going to build a network of 500,000 charging stations all across the country. Offer consumer rebates to swap old or fuel inefficient vehicles for new clean American made models. Together, this will mean according to the estimates, more than a million good new jobs in the American auto release, because we will own the electric vehicle market in the world.\nJoe Biden: (29:48)\nFolks I guarantee you, we can do this, but we have to come together. I remember you and I talking gov when I was running for the nomination in my same way to unite the country. You’re the only one whp thought I was right. That used to be the old days. Yeah, Joe, you got a lot done. You used to walk across to get a lot done, but everything’s changed. Well folks, if we can’t unite the country, we’re in trouble.\nJoe Biden: (30:23)\nAmerica and our system runs on consensus. Compromise is not a dirty word. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. I do not see American terms of red and blue. Bringing the country together, that’s the job of a president. It’s a duty to care. To care for everybody. We can be so much better than what we see.\nJoe Biden: (31:04)\nWe can be what you are at our best, when we’re the United States of America. Folks, you have to vote and people are turning out here in this state and overwhelming numbers around the country. If you have any doubt, go visit iwillvote.com/and-i. Early voting is happening now. Every city and township clerk’s office in the state. You can register to vote in one quick stop. You have your ballot already, mail it or drop it in a Dropbox today.\nJoe Biden: (31:47)\nDon’t wait, vote, and don’t just vote for me and Senator Harris and Gary as well. Vote all the way down the line. We’re going to need Gary back in the United States Senate, looking out for Michigan families because we’re going to win back the United States Senate. When we do, we’re going to change things. Folks, this time I really mean this to restore the soul of America. To rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class.\nJoe Biden: (32:23)\nThis time is I’d bring everybody along. Debbie, may remember my colleagues in the caucus used to wonder kid me because I quote President Kennedy. When he was about going to the moon and famous speech, everybody remembers the different parts of it. The line I remember more than anything else. He answered the question that wasn’t, it was implicitly being asked, “Why are you doing this?” He said, “Because we’d refused to postpone. I refuse to postpone the work America must do now to bring this country back.”\nJoe Biden: (33:01)\nThere’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to American future. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. No other country can do that. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Well, we have to let them know who we are. What we stand for, we choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. Folks thank you and may God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

         "President Trump: (00:30)\nThank you. What a nice group. Thank you very much. Beautiful, thank you.\nCrowd: (00:50)\nFour more years.\nPresident Trump: (00:52)\nThank you very much, please. We are going to be talking to our great senior citizens, that’s what I’m here for today.\nSpeaker 1: (00:55)\n[crosstalk 00:00:50].\nPresident Trump: (00:56)\nWe love our senior citizens. And I’m honored to be here in Fort Myers to reaffirm my solemn pledge to America’s seniors, it’s so important to me, I happen to be a senior. I will protect you, I will defend you, and I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and conviction that I have. You devoted your life to this country and I am devoting my life to you. My administration is working every day to give our amazing senior citizens the care, support, and respect that you deserve, and you understand that, we’ve worked together for a long time. As president, I’m deeply aware that America’s 54 million seniors have borne the heaviest burden of the China virus. Many older Americans have endured months of isolation, missing weddings, births, graduations, church, and family reunions, you know that very well, you know it all too well. My heart breaks for every grieving family that has lost a precious loved one, I feel their anguish, and I mourn their loss, I feel their pain.\nPresident Trump: (02:09)\nI know that the terrible pain that they have gone through, and you lose someone, and there’s nothing to describe what you have to bear, there’s nothing to describe it. In times of challenge, we turn to our fellow Americans for a shoulder to lean on and we turn to God for healing and strength, and together we will overcome. My message to America’s seniors today is one of optimism, confidence, and hope. Your sacrifice has not been in vain. The light at the end of the tunnel is near. We are rounding the turn, I say that all the time, some of the media doesn’t like hearing it, but I say it all the time, we’re rounding that turn. Don’t listen to the cynics, and angry partisans, and professional pessimists, we are Americans and we will prevail, we are prevailing, and we are… It’s amazing what’s happening, if you look at what’s going on, it’s been really very amazing.\nPresident Trump: (03:15)\nI’m moving heaven and earth to safeguard our seniors from the China virus to deliver life-saving therapies in record time and to distribute a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year, and we’re really doing it even sooner than that, you see what’s going on, we have the vaccines getting ready to go. Seniors will be the first in line for the vaccine and we will soon be ending this pandemic, hasn’t happened a thing like this since 1918, 1917, that was a bad one too, that was a real bad one. I will not rest until we’ve eradicated this plague from our country, and our lives, and our world, we want it out. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. Our aggressive and early action saved more than 2 million lives compared to the best estimates from last spring, you remember when they were giving you estimates.\nPresident Trump: (04:14)\nSince the beginning, our nation’s seniors have been my top priority, it was obvious very early on that it was affecting the seniors not young people. Young people are… They have that strong immune system and I give all credit to them, but they have a strong immune system, and 99.99, think of that. But, when you get into people that have a few more years, it’s a little bit more difficult, when you get a lot more years, it’s a lot more difficult. But, what they’ve done with therapeutics now and what they’ve done with all of the other things that they’re doing, it’s incredible. We heightened mitigation and surge testing to protect those at highest risk. We sent billions and billions of dollars in funding to personal protective equipment and distributed rapid testing to 15,400 nursing homes all over the country.\nPresident Trump: (05:09)\nWe’ve worked with a lot of governors and some have done a great job, and some have done not a great job, and some have done a very poor job, actually, but some have done a great job, but we’re working very closely with the governors of the states. Just this week, even the New York Times, this was shocking, was forced to admit that ‘experts are saying with genuine confidence that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than they expected’. And they’re right, but I was shocked to hear coming out of the New York Times, right? I was a little [inaudible 00:05:55], and it’s thanks to my administration’s Operation Warp Speed, incredible people. Because of advances in treatment we pioneered, and we have many treatments, but because of these great advances, we’ve reached the point where the fatality rate is reduced by 85% since April and now it’s up to probably 91%. Well, I’m here, I tell you.\nCrowd: (06:27)\nFour more years.\nPresident Trump: (06:27)\nThank you. Well, I don’t know what they gave me, but give me some more of it right now and you can have some too. No, I know exactly what that gave, it was actually pretty amazing. I’m also working with the FDA and HHS to make the antibody treatment that I received, it’s called Regeneron plus… Also, it’s incredible, and what they can do today is incredible. And they felt very confident even six months ago when they started, think of it, we got this all done in a very short period of time and now we’re going for emergency use, because we’re going to make it available to everyone who needs it for free, anybody in the country. And Eli Lilly is making a very similar drug, and Alex, they’re working very hard on that, right? Alex Azar, so thank you very much, because I want people to get it and we’re getting it free, right? So, we got to do that. If you need it, if you don’t need it, that’s even better, okay? That’s even better, but if you need it, right? You get it.\nPresident Trump: (07:54)\nIt’s really pretty amazing what happened, because I wasn’t feeling great and the next day I wake up and I’m saying, “Who can I fight today?” Thank you. So, our groundbreaking therapies have significantly improved and improved our outcomes for elderly patients, but I’ll not relent until all American seniors are safe, you’re going to be safe, a hundred percent safe, and we’re at a point where really so much progress has been made. Under Operation Warp Speed, we’re on track to deliver at least 100 million doses of a vaccine this year, and could even be a little bit sooner than what they were originally anticipating, with hundreds of millions more to quickly follow, Alex, remember that Alex. Today, I’m thrilled to announce that we have just finalized a partnership with CVS and Walgreens, two places you know pretty well, I guess, to immediately deliver the vaccine directly to nursing homes at no cost to our seniors, right? No cost.\nPresident Trump: (09:15)\nThese are very effective, once you have that vaccine you can open those doors and say, “Here I am.” But with everything that I say and everything I do, if you feel safer at home… And we can all be like, ” Let’s get out there.” And I felt as president, I knew there was risk, but I had to be out, I can’t just be locked in a basement, to put it… Lock them in a basement. I felt I had to be out there, I would see Gold Star families, [inaudible 00:00:09:44], and I’ve been looking forward for months to come into the White House, and many, many other people, military people and heads of state. And I know you put yourself at risk, but you can’t… You have to lead your life. But I say this, there are people also that would rather stay in place, stay where you are, and to those people, and I understand that very well, stay, just relax, stay until it’s gone, and it’ll be gone, but stay. Don’t feel badly or don’t feel good about it, just stay, if you feel safe, stay.\nPresident Trump: (10:15)\nI’m working as hard as I can so you can kiss and hug your children and grandchildren very soon, that’s something I missed also, I will be honest with you. As we shelter high-risk Americans with extreme vigilance, we must also allow lower-risk Americans to return to work and return to school. I mean, children should go to school. My young son, Baron, had it, and he had it, and all of a sudden he doesn’t have it, it’s like… It was different, it’s a whole different deal, and they should go to school, and they have to, because… I talk about the cure, right? It cannot be worse than the problem itself, it’s a very simple statement, but the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. And with young children, they have to go to school, they have to be with other kids, they have to grow up, they can’t lose a year of their life. And if you look at some of these lockdowns that the Democrats are doing in some states, if you look at North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, and Michigan, we won the case against her in Michigan.\nPresident Trump: (11:24)\nI mean, she’s running like a prison except for her husband who’s allowed to go boating, that doesn’t work out somehow. Fortunately, they caught him, he was going to go on the lake boating, that’s nice, but nobody else was allowed to do it. But we won the case against her for Michigan, and we freed up the state, and it’s a great thing, I mean, it’s a great thing, we freed up the state. Because that whole thing with drugs, and alcohol, and depression and all of the horrible things, we could go over a long list of things, but we can’t let that happen. So, we want the Democrat, radical left, in many cases, Democrats, we wanted to open their states, open up your states, and we’re very careful with our seniors, and that’s different, but open up your states, get it back.\nPresident Trump: (12:16)\nDespite punishing society-wide lockdowns in Europe, I don’t know if you’ve been watching, they’re now experiencing a massive surge in cases. Daily cases are 2500% higher in the United Kingdom, as an example, and 722% higher in Europe than in the United States, okay? No, think of that. And we wish them… And we’re working with them closely, we’re making ventilators for them. For many of the countries over there, we became the ventilator king. I mean, we didn’t have many ventilators, we had… Really, we inherited bare cupboards, I said the cupboards were bare, in many of the states they had… Cupboards were bare, and now they’re loaded up and they’re ready…\nPresident Trump: (13:03)\nCupboards were bare. And now they’re loaded up and they’re ready. But the hardest thing are the ventilators because of the complexity of the machine, and the cost, the size, but the pure complexity. And we make thousands of ventilators now a month and we’re sending them all over the world. We’re all set with the ventilators but we’re sending them all over the world. But hopefully you won’t need them. Soon you won’t even need them. I really think you’re going to not need the ventilators, hopefully soon, very soon. But sadly in Europe, the average daily deaths are really soaring. 402% higher in the United Kingdom. 493% higher in Europe. Meanwhile, in the United States deaths have decreased by 37%. So that’s something, right.\nPresident Trump: (13:53)\nThe fake news doesn’t want to tell you that, right? They want no piece of that. They don’t want anything to do with that. So whether you’re Republican or Democrat, we must use facts over fear. We have to. Science over hysteria, hope over despair, and the common good over partisan politics. And again, if you feel good, if you feel safe because it’s going to be gone, stay where you are. Don’t leave. Don’t say, “Oh gee, I have to get out.” The President said, “Let’s get out.” Stay where you are. I have a lot of friends, they’re strong people. They’re senior citizens. Great people, very successful people. Hi. Look, she’s waving. Hi. Thank you. Thank you, hun.\nPresident Trump: (14:32)\nBut you know they’re tough actually, but they feel comfortable until this has gone and there are people, and I do that. Do that. I might do that. If I weren’t in this position, maybe I’d be doing it myself. In this position, it’s a little tougher. But we cannot allow unscientific, panic driven, fear-based policies to deny our children and grandchildren their future, and their dreams. We can’t take a year or two years out of their lives. There’s a whole social thing going on there too.\nPresident Trump: (15:02)\nThese left wing lock downs will crush America, and my plan is very simple. We’re going to crush the virus and go back to exactly where we were. We’re almost getting back there now. So together, we will end this pandemic. We will rebuild our economy and we will ensure our seniors can live long, happy, secure, and healthy lives with your grandchildren and your children. You’re going to hug them, right? It’s good. Under my leadership next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country economically. We’re grateful to be joined today by Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. Alex, we’re counting on you. We’re counting… I’m going to blame him if this stuff doesn’t happen fast, right?\nPresident Trump: (15:48)\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid services, a fantastic woman, Administrator Seema Verma. Thank you, Seema. Great job you’re doing. A friend of mine who’s become very, very popular, I guess that was what that big applause was. I was backstage, I said, “Who just came in?” I thought Elvis entered the room. It was your Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis. Stand up. That’s great, Ron. Great.\nPresident Trump: (16:34)\nAnd by the way, we have some crowd. You see what’s going on outside? The mayor said, “He’s never seen anything like that. He’s never seen anything.” Now there’s a lot of love outside. I want to tell you. That’s a lot of love and we’re leading in the State of Florida, just so we understand. By perhaps a lot. Also with some warriors, Representatives Gus Bilirakis. Gus, Gus, great job, Gus. And another friend of mine, these are really terrific people, Greg Stube. Greg, thank you very much, Greg. Thank you. Thanks as well to Fort Myers, Mayor Randy Henderson. Randy. Thank you. Thank you, Randy. Good job, Randy. That’s quite a crowd, huh?\nSpeaker 2: (17:27)\nWelcome to town, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump: (17:29)\nThat’s good. Thank you very much. And Cape Coral Mayor Joe Coviello. Joe Coviello. Thank you, Joe. Great job. Great job. We’re also tremendously honored to be joined by World War II and Korean War veteran, a very brave guy, Wally Cortese. Wiley Cortese. Thank you, Wally. You look good, Wally. I’ll tell you, two wars and you’re looking good. Thank you, Wally. Appreciate it. Beautiful. Thank you very much. Thanks also to all of the members of the VFW Golden Gate Honor Guard, they’re with us today. Thank you. That’s so great. That’s so great. VFW. Fantastic job. Thank you very much for being here. As I fight to protect our amazing seniors from the China virus, I’m also fighting to protect you from another danger. One, which threatens everything we cherish, value and worked our entire lives to build and to defend. As we gathered today, seniors are under threat from a radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life. We’re not going to allow it. And you know one thing, sleepy Joe and do nothing about it. The left has been taken over by socialists and Marxists and extremists and they have. They want to transform our nation into a country that would no longer be recognizable. And their agenda will shatter America’s seniors, their plan to delay the vaccine, delay therapies and prolong the pandemic will cost thousands and thousands of lives, will be horrifying for our country.\nPresident Trump: (19:33)\nThey are planned for higher taxes. They want to quadruple taxes. Every company will move out. They’ll go back to where they came. We had tremendous people, tremendous companies come into our country. We’re bring in tremendous jobs, 160 million jobs, we’ve never had anything like it, before the plague and then we’re building it back up again. Last four months, we’ve set records on employment, on hiring employment. And a number that, let’s say a year ago, wouldn’t have sounded great, but now sounds incredible, 7.8% unemployment. Think of it. People were talking about 42%. We’re back down to 7.8 and we’ll be soon down to the number where we were, seven months ago. Pretty amazing.\nPresident Trump: (20:20)\nI never thought I’d be happy with 7.8%, but you know when you think about it, right, they were talking 39%, 42%. Ron, 7.8 is a pretty amazing thing. We did that in a rapid fashion. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it, actually. They’re planned for higher taxes and crippling regulations, however, would crater our economy. Their insane energy policies because you know they’re going to be fracking. Hey, Biden for a year and a half is saying there will be no fracking. Then he looks out, he gets the nomination because Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So Bernie, a second time, that happened twice to Bernie. Bernie, he’s a hell of a loser. That’s one thing I’ll say. He knows how to lose. He knows how to lose. He loses he goes back to work like nothing happened. No, they took it away from him twice. I think the second time in a way worse, because she stayed in, she took the votes and sleepy Joe just got in there. That’s why you got to be careful. You got to be careful. You never know what happens.\nPresident Trump: (21:23)\nBut if you take a look and we can’t let any of this stuff happen. And you look at what’s happened to other countries, where they’ve had this philosophy, where they’ve had this ideology. We can’t let… But you watch what they’re saying about the fracking, where he said no, and he said it with such… It’s not like, “Well, I’ll think about it.” He’s doing the same thing with the courts right now. They’re going to pack the Supreme Court. You see what they want to do. Would be destruction of our country. But you take a look. So he says, “No, there will be no fracking.” These are the words. “There will be no fracking. You don’t understand what I just said. There will be no fracking.” And then he gets very agitated. “There would be no fracking.”\nPresident Trump: (22:06)\nAnd he gets a nomination, goes to Pennsylvania, they inform him that they have a million jobs and fracking’s a big deal. And they like inexpensive energy, right? And so, he goes from, “There will be no fracking with great anger”, to “I never said they wouldn’t be fracking.” It’s the craziest thing. If that ever happened to me and the media doesn’t even talk about it. That’s just one of many things. Then he does that thing with the courts. You see that, right? He goes, “I’ll tell you after the election what I’m going to do.” How important is it? Because he’s going to put on radical, left, crazy judges that will destroy your lives. It’s the most important. They’ve always said… I’ve always heard, Ron, I’ve always heard this, that the most important thing a president does is pick Supreme Court Justices, right? I would say maybe the military, but let’s say it’s right there. And he has to create a list of more than just that, he has to create a list and let you know and he has to pick from that list. That’s what I did. I created a list of 25 people, highly, highly capable people. And a lot of people said, that’s why I won the election, actually. So I don’t know if that’s true or not. But it was a very important part, Mary, you understand mayors, you know that.\nPresident Trump: (23:29)\nSo their insane energy policies will abolish millions of jobs and cost seniors thousands of dollars per year in higher energy bills. Their anti-police agenda will empower violent mobs and put every community at risk. Their anti-suburban agenda threatens the property values of millions of American seniors and your families, who own homes in residential neighborhoods, in the suburbs. I’m saving the suburbs. People saying, “Well, women in the suburbs, do they like Trump?” I said, “Yeah, they liked me. You know why they like, because I’m saving their homes.” That’s why they like me. They may not like me, but they like what I’m doing, and that’s more important.\nPresident Trump: (24:17)\nOh boy, they have these crazy people. The people on television, I don’t know if suburban women, suburban women want security. They want safety. They want law and order. They want their homes to be protected. The socialist ideology that they will use and indoctrinate our youth with is like poisonous Anti-American propaganda.\nPresident Trump: (24:46)\nThe plan by Washington Democrats to give amnesty and free healthcare to illegal border crossers will obliterate Medicare, bankrupt your social security, robbing you of the benefits that you’ve paid for your entire lives. Look, take a look at Venezuela. People don’t realize, that was a wealthy country 18, 17 years ago. It was so wealthy. And it’s gone from being wealthy, they don’t have medicine, they don’t have food, they don’t have water. They don’t have anything. And it can happen here, just a much larger version with that ideology. And that’s the ideology that they’re looking at. It’s crazy.\nPresident Trump: (25:23)\nThese radicals will destroy Medicare with totally open borders. And by the way, you know the wall, it’s up to almost 400 miles. 400. 400 miles. And it goes down deep, tunneling. It goes down deep and up very high. Now it’s had a tremendous… We’ve never had a stronger Southern border than we have right now. It’ll be finished very soon. We’re doing 10 miles a week. That’s a lot. 10 miles a week. Army Corps of Engineers are also doing Lake Okeechobee and lots of other things, right? They’re doing a good job, right? They’re giving away your benefits, that’s what-\nPresident Trump: (26:03)\nThey’re giving away your benefits, that’s what they want to do to anyone in the world who trespasses into our country. And we all have big hearts and we want to take care of people. But when you say, “We’re going to give you free healthcare. We’re going to give you college education.” I sarcastically said once, “We’re going to give you a beautiful brand new Rolls-Royce. Okay? If you’re an illegal immigrant. And CNN went and they said, “The President lied to the seniors.” They just don’t get it. They get it. Actually, unfortunately they get it more than you would think. They’re a little bit on the evil side.\nPresident Trump: (26:39)\nBut, you’re going to bring millions of people … You’re going to bring millions and millions of people. It’s like, when you say, “Free healthcare, and free education, and free this and that,” millions of people are going to pour into the country. It’s not going to be stoppable. And we can’t let that happen. They care more about illegal aliens than they care about senior citizens, the Democrats. The left is coming after me because I’m defending you. And that’s true. That’s why they come after me. Every day they come … But we caught them on the Russian hoax. We finally caught them after two and a half years. Russia knows. Turned out to be the exact opposite. They’re the ones that were playing with Russia. That was a beauty. Hillary … Crooked Hillary. Now they’re the ones. Yeah, I agree with you. I used to just be quiet. And I agree with you 100%. Millions and millions of dollars they paid. And they tried to show it. It was the greatest hoax and the greatest political crime in the history of our country. That’s what they committed. But I’m the only one standing between their open borders and extremism and the healthcare benefits that you’ve earned and paid for. All your life, you paid for. As long as I’m President, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare or your social security. As a candidate, I made a sacred promise that I’d strengthen, protect and defend your Medicare benefits. And that’s exactly what I’ve done. I’ve done that, right?\nPresident Trump: (28:24)\nMy administration’s fought to deliver greater security, affordability, fairness, economic stability to our nation’s seniors. Under eight years of the previous administration, premiums for Medicare health plans went up including a 25% increase right here in Florida. That’s for the previous people. Under my administration, we’ve lowered Medicare Advantage premiums by a number nobody even believes, 34% nationwide. And today, it’s the lowest level in 14 years. Did you know that, Ron? That’s not a bad thing for you to put into your speech, right? Who would think that? No, but seriously, we’ve brought it way down. This group over here, they’ve done a great job. Thanks to our efforts, there are 2,000 … Thank you.\nPresident Trump: (29:16)\nThere are 2,000 more Medicare Advantage plans today than there were three years ago. That’s incredible. Think of that. That means more choice and more competition for better care at a much lower cost. When we rapidly expanded telehealth for Medicare beneficiaries during the pandemic, the number of tele-health users increased from 14,000 a week to 1.7 million a week. What’s that percentage? Yet, all of this danger, it’s all in danger because if these other people get in, they will end all of that. The telehealth … It’s interesting. We’ve learned something for children, they’re much better in a classroom than they are on a laptop. Okay? Children.\nPresident Trump: (30:03)\nBut for your health and what you can do, you can do so much of it, such a big percentage, better than going out and going through … This telehealth has been amazing. It’s been really incredible. It’s been an incredible thing. It’s increased like six, 7,000, I think 6500%. And it’s probably the only thing that came out of this whole deal that we really can take pleasure at, telehealth. It’s been really an incredible thing that’s happened. Over 130 Democrats in Congress, including far left Senator Kamala Harris, who is the most … I said, “He’ll never choose her because nobody treated him worse than her. Nobody.” Plus, her poll numbers were sinking. She never even got to Iowa. She never got there. And when I said, “Oh … ”\nPresident Trump: (31:01)\nAnd by the way, didn’t Mike Pence do a good job the other night? Right? Good man. Did a great job. And I had a great … Thank you. Really, I had a lot of fun last night with that. That was a nice evening. It was a nice pleasurable evening. I had somebody going totally crazy last night. “But, I told you … I told you that.” She told me? She’s going to … Oh, okay. I believe you, right? No, but I understand that worked out very well last night. That’s what the word is, so that’s good. Another evening in paradise, I call it. They’re sponsoring a socialist healthcare plan that would annihilate your Medicare. The Democrats’ policy proposals may go by different names. They put all sorts of names. They say single payer, or so-called the public option.\nPresident Trump: (32:03)\nBut really, they’re all based on the same core promise, raiding Medicare to fund a socialist healthcare takeover. And it’s going to destroy your Medicare. That’s the one thing you know for sure. Every one of their plans involves rationing care, restricting access, denying coverage, slashing quality, extending wait times and massively raising your taxes. Other than that, it’s actually quite good. As we know from seeing these left wing policies in action around the world, seniors will be the victims. And that’s what happens, the first to go are the seniors, the victims are really the seniors. This is nothing that unique. Socialist healthcare plans always end up denying care and coverage to the sick and the elderly in order to control costs.\nPresident Trump: (32:54)\nAnd they always feel that this is the easiest way to do it. We must not let them bring this lethal and deadly agenda to America. Don’t let it happen. Got to vote them out. Get out and vote. Democrat healthcare proposals would abolish private insurance for 180 million Americans. Just so you know, there are many people, they’ve had a good life, they’ve done well. They have private plans. They are unbelievable. They love their plan. Those plans are gone. Those plans are gone. They’d abolish the Medicare Advantage program that benefits 24 million seniors, including one out of two Hispanic seniors and one out of three African-American seniors who enrolled in the Medicare Advantage. Right?\nPresident Trump: (33:46)\nAnd that will all be ended. It would be abolished, for big fat, ugly socialized medicine. You go to a hospital, you don’t feel good. Go to a hospital room and wait for three days to see a doctor. I will never allow that to happen. Under my administration, your Medicare Advantage is safe. Your benefits are protected. And I will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always, always, always. They always play that card, right? Remember they used to say, “Oh, he’s going to give up.” At first they said I was going to be in a war within the first week. Whatever happened to that, right? Just the opposite. Our great warriors are coming home. They’re all coming home. They’re all coming home. You’re welcome.\nPresident Trump: (34:38)\nLook at North Korea, they thought would be a war and a war immediately with North Korea. How’s that worked out, right? It’s worked out very nicely. Talk, we’ll talk, keep talking. But it worked out very well. But the other thing they said, “He will destroy your social security.” Really? Did I? I said, “No.” No, they’re going to destroy it, because they’ll destroy our country. They’ll destroy your social security and they’ll destroy your country. And Joe won’t have any idea what happened, because he’s gone. Let’s face it. He’s gone. Another critical issue for senior citizens is the price of prescription drugs. This is something I’m very proud of, because we’ve lowered Part D prescription drug premiums by 12%, saving senior citizens $1.9 billion.\nPresident Trump: (35:23)\nBut the biggest yet to come, I stood up to big pharma, and that’s not easy. They got big money. They’re the biggest lobbyist in this country by far. And I signed an executive order, implemented a most favorite nations policy for the United States. For years you’ve heard, “We pay more for drugs than any other country.” Well, that’s not even close. We pay much more. And in other countries that we know very well take advantage of us and they pay a fraction. I mean, you wouldn’t even believe how much less, but a fraction. 25 cents for a pill, as opposed to $2 for a pill. Same pill from the same lab plant, right? And I instituted a favorite nations clause. I said, if Germany or some other country is getting our stuff low, I want a favored nations. Meaning, I want it for the same price. And they have gone crazy.\nPresident Trump: (36:18)\nI have never seen so many ads. They put on more ads against me now than sleepy Joe Biden, I’m telling you, and they understand. Look, it should have been done a long time ago. This should’ve been done years ago. Plus, I got rid of the middleman and I gave Ron DeSantis the right to go to Canada in the meantime, because I think eventually you’ll be using this. But in the meantime, you’ll also be getting the rebates. Okay? Rebates, you know who they go to? The middlemen. You know how rich the middlemen are? I’m rich. These guys blow everyone away. I don’t know … Nobody even knows who the hell they are. Did you ever hear … Does anybody know a middleman? I would like to meet. It’s Biden’s son. It’s Hunter. Oh, it’s Hunter. I’ll bet you Hunter is a middleman. He’s collecting …\nPresident Trump: (37:14)\nHe’s like a vacuum cleaner, he follows his father around collecting. What a disgrace. It’s a crime family. You want to know something? It’s a crime family. He’s following his father. Hunter Biden is a middleman. Oh, that’s wild. No, these people are amazing. These middlemen, you’re right. Hunter made no money until his father became Vice President and now he’s like a vacuum cleaner. His father goes to Germany, Hunter’s right there. “Hey, give me a couple of million.” Not a couple of million. Hell of a lot more than a couple of million. That’s a shame. I’ll tell you what, it’s an organized crime family, as far as I’m concerned. I capped out of pocket costs … And the way they get protected by big tech and by the media, the media doesn’t want to ask … This is the hottest subject there is right now.\nPresident Trump: (38:04)\nAnd I didn’t watch sleepy Joe last night. I just wanted to see what he looked like. He wasn’t looking too good. I just couldn’t watch, it was too painful. But, they didn’t … I understand that they did not ask him a question about this. Can you believe it? Now, think of it. And Stephanopoulos interviewed me two weeks ago and he was nasty. He was nasty. I mean, he was tough. He’s a tough guy.\nPresident Trump: (38:29)\nI watched last night, the little stuff I watched and what I heard, it was like softballs, every … But he didn’t … This is the hottest subject there is. They didn’t ask them one question about their corruption in the family. They didn’t ask him one question about how big tech is protecting him. Big tech is not allowing anybody to … How about this? They took down, I guess, Kayleigh, but they took … How about Kayleigh? Isn’t she great? No, but they took down her Twitter site because she had the audacity to put up-\nPresident Trump: (39:03)\n… on her Twitter site because she had the audacity to put up an article written in the New York Post, which is one of the biggest newspapers in the country. I think it’s the oldest newspaper in the country. They put up a article, and they took down her site. Can you believe what’s going on in this country? And then they talk about freedom of the press. They also said last night, it was very interesting, they talked about the transition, the friendly transition. Will you agree to the friendly … Of course the answer is yes. First of all, I don’t think there’s going to be a transition because we’re going to win but … Let’s hope we don’t have to worry about it. No, but think of this. They get up, “We demand a friendly transition.” Yet, we caught them spying on my campaign, and trying to take down the president of the United States. Right? That wasn’t too friendly. Right? That wasn’t too friendly, and we caught them cold.\nPresident Trump: (39:55)\nAnyway, let’s get back to the medical parts of the world. This is much simpler to understand, if you think about it. But I capped out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 a month. People were going, literally they were going bankrupt over insulin, or they weren’t getting the insulin, which is a terrible thing. It’s $35 a month or less for seniors in many Medicare drug plans, saving them an average of nearly $450. I mean that’s a tremendous saving. Many cases much less than 35. Seema, in many cases much less than the 35. Right? Did you say $1 in some cases? What’s your lowest number? Come on, Seema. Let’s hear it. Huh? She doesn’t want to give too much. I think maybe $1 is too much. Okay. She’s very straight. She’s a straight player. You brought it down from what number? The 35 down from what Seema?\nSeema: (40:53)\n[inaudible 00:01:53].\nPresident Trump: (40:56)\nTremendously. Yeah. It’s a great job. You did that. But she would come up to me for a year and a half talking about the insulin. The insulin is the biggest, it’s such a problem for people where they’d go without it. They had no choice because it was too expensive. Great job both of you. Thank you very much.\nPresident Trump: (41:16)\nI also announced that more than 35 million Medicare beneficiaries will soon receive a card in the mail with $200 that you can use to help pay for prescription drugs. But I was going to tell you, I’ve allowed Ron DeSantis now to go to Canada and buy your prescription drugs. Now, why am I doing that? Because before all of the favored nations and everythings kick in, which ultimately I think that’s what you’re going to be using more than anything. But Canada gets their drugs for about 50% of what we get them for. Same drug, same exact pill, company, everything, Johnson & Johnson, whatever the company, Ron is going to buy from Canada, and he’s just cut your price in half. Right? Right? When are you starting that Ron? When do you think you’ll start?\nRon DeSantis: (42:08)\n[inaudible 00:42:08].\nPresident Trump: (42:10)\nWhen?\nRon DeSantis: (42:10)\nVery soon.\nPresident Trump: (42:11)\nVery soon. So Alex get him approved up. Okay? Whatever you have to do. I think it’s great. Some people say, “Well that doesn’t …” My attitude is, whatever the hell it takes. We have this terrible system that’s taken years and years to rig. Like the ballots. Right? Like the ballots. It’s taken them years and years to rig. So they’re very simple. Go buy from Canada. We get rid of the middleman. We get rid of all of this nonsense. You like that mayor? You like that mayor? Both of you? Pretty great Ron. Do it fast Ron. Do it fast. To care for, I mean you’re not going to believe what’s going to be happening with your numbers. I mean they’re coming down big.\nPresident Trump: (42:49)\nWe’re not talking about 1%. I mean I don’t even want to mention it, but last year out of 51 years, this is the first time the prescription drug prices have come down in 51 years. They didn’t come down much. They came down like 1%, which I don’t want to mention in one way. But in another way, it tells you something. First time in 51 years when drug prices come down. But now you’re talking about a 50, 60, 70, and 80% reduction in your prescription drug prices. We got to get it all finished up. Wouldn’t it be terrible if Sleepy Joe took this over, the system that I’ve created? And you people will say, “Man, has he been a great president. Look at what he’s done.”\nPresident Trump: (43:32)\nAs an example, transparency starts on January 1st. I said to my people, “You couldn’t start it like in August, back? They said, “Sir, you have to go statutorily here, here, here.” I say, “Yeah, but I’d better win this damn election because, can you imagine, mayor, he’ll be saying, “Boy, I’m getting a lot of credit. What the hell did Trump do? This is unbelievable.” I promise you, they won’t give the credit to us. Will, they, huh? No, but I think we’re not going to have to worry about it. I hope that … get out and vote, vote, vote. To care for our nation’s veterans, I signed into law VA Choice and VA Accountability. Nobody thought that would be possible. Right? Nobody thought that would be possible.\nPresident Trump: (44:17)\nWe’ve also invested billions and billions of dollars in research and innovative treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, kidney disease, sickle cell disease, AIDS, cancer, and many other illnesses. I will say this, AIDS will be eradicated in this country now in six years. I started right at the beginning. President Obama should have started, he could have started it two years before, or two and a half years before. They wasted two years. But we started it right at the beginning of the administration, and it was a ten-year program. We’re down to six years. In six years it will be essentially eradicated in our country. Think of that. Who would have thought that? It’s an amazing thing. It should have been started before I got into office. It could have been.\nPresident Trump: (45:04)\nDay after day I’m fighting to defend our seniors from the virus, from Big Pharma, oh they love me, special interests, and from the radical socialist left. American seniors, remind us that we’ve inherited an incredible, extraordinary legacy. You’re the generation that defeated Fascism and triumphed over Communism, sent American astronauts to the moon. You built our country into the greatest and most powerful nation the world has ever known. Frankly, right now it’s more powerful than it ever was. When I took over, we had a depleted military. We have now a military … we have the greatest weapons on Earth. We are the envy of the world.\nPresident Trump: (45:49)\nWe have the greatest weapons, the missiles, rockets, tanks, the tankers, the freighters, the boats, the ships, the jet fighters, F-35s, the F-18s, F-16s. Nobody has the equipment that we have in the world. Not even close. Even the hypersonic missiles. You know? Under the Obama Administration, they stole our plans for hypersonic. That’s the super-duper, I call them the super-duper missiles. The ones that go so fast, you can’t even see them, and now we have that. You probably read about it last night. We have the fastest by far in the world.\nPresident Trump: (46:29)\nNow we’re doing a great job, and our seniors and generations of Americans before you, they did not pour out their heart, and soul, and blood, and tears, for this country only now to surrender our freedom, our flag, and our American way of life. You seniors have protected us, and now I as a senior and all of my people, we are protecting you. Your courage, your leadership, your patriotism, and your faith, are an inspiration to us all. With your help we will transcend every obstacle, defeat every threat, and triumph over every single challenge. We will lift our nation to new heights of greatness and glory, and America will emerge stronger, more united, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before. For our nation, for our great seniors, and for our beloved children and grandchildren, the best is yet to come. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.",

         "George Stephanopoulos: (00:41)\nHey, and welcome to our town hall with Joe Biden. Mr. Vice President, welcome to you.\nJoe Biden: (00:46)\nGood to be with you.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (00:47)\nWe’re here with a group of Pennsylvania voters. You can see they’re all appropriately socially distanced tonight. And there are a group of, some are voting for you, some have said they’re voting for president Trump, some are still undecided, and we’re going to try to take questions from as many of them as we can tonight.\nJoe Biden: (01:02)\nOkay.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:02)\nAnd we’re going to start with Nicholas Fed, and he’s from Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. That’s close to here, in Philadelphia.\nJoe Biden: (01:08)\nI know it well.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:09)\nYou’re a Democrat.\nNicholas Fed: (01:11)\nI’m a Democrat. Thank you, George. Mr. Vice President, every day, my wife and I are in disbelief at the lack of coordinated federal action on COVID-19. We know that your administration would follow the science. My question for you, it’s two parts. First, looking backwards to when this country first became aware of COVID-19, what would following the science have meant in terms of actual policy? And then, looking forward, what would your administration do in terms of following the science with real concrete policies that haven’t been done by the current administration?\nJoe Biden: (01:55)\nWell, first of all, going back, the fact is that the president was informed how dangerous this virus was. And all the way back in the beginning of February, I argued that we should be keeping people in China. And we had set up, in our administration, a pandemic office within the White House. There were 44 people on the ground.\nJoe Biden: (02:16)\nI suggested that we should be seeking, and I didn’t hold public office, I was a former Vice President, we in fact asked to have access to the source of the problem. And the best of our knowledge, Trump never pushed that. All those 44 people came home, never got replaced. In addition to that, I pointed out that I thought in February, I did a piece for USA Today saying, “This is a serious problem. Trump denied it. He said it wasn’t.”\nJoe Biden: (02:42)\nWe later learned that he knew full well how serious it was when he did an interview with George Woodward. I mean, excuse me, Bob Woodward. And at the time, he said he didn’t tell anybody because he was afraid Americans would panic. Americans don’t panic, he panicked. He didn’t say a word to anybody.\nJoe Biden: (02:58)\nThen I wrote a piece in March about what I thought we should be doing to take hold of this, using the… There’s an act that passed a long time ago that allows the president to go into a business and say, “Stop making this, and start making that.” And it took a long time for him to even institute that, to get ventilators and so on. And so, the point was he missed enormous opportunities and kept saying things that weren’t true. It’s going to go away by Easter, don’t worry about it. When the summer comes, it’s all going to go away like a miracle. He’s still saying those things.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (03:31)\nBefore you go to the future, can I follow up on the, “I’m looking backwards.” just a little bit? You did have an op-ed in January where you warned of the seriousness of the pandemic, but there’s no record of you calling for social distancing, limited social gatherings, mandatory mask-\nJoe Biden: (03:47)\nNot back then.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (03:47)\nIn January, February.\nJoe Biden: (03:49)\nNot in January, February. No, that’s correct, there wasn’t. That came at the end of March. And then I laid out a detailed plan relative to school openings in June and July. By that time, the science was becoming clearer and clearer of how this was spreading so rapidly. But the president kept denying that. If you notice, from March on, I stopped doing big meetings, I started wearing masks.\nJoe Biden: (04:13)\nSo, it was at a time when the science was saying, and his key people, Dr. Fauci were saying, “You should be taking these precautions.” So, what we should be doing now, there should be a national standard. Instead of leaving this up to, remember what the president said to the governors, “Well, they’re on their own, it’s not my responsibility. The governors can do what they need to do, not my responsibility.” It is a presidential responsibility to lead, and he didn’t do that.\nJoe Biden: (04:37)\nHe didn’t talk about what needed to be done because he kept worrying, in my view, about the stock market. He worried if he talked about how bad this could be, unless we took these precautionary actions, then in fact, the market would go down. And his barometer of success to the economy is the market.\nJoe Biden: (04:56)\nThirdly, what we didn’t do is, the president had an opportunity to open and allow schools and businesses to stay open if they got the kind of help they needed. So, the Congress passed a couple of trillion dollars worth of help. And what happened was most of that money, a significant portion of that money went to the very wealthiest corporations in the country, didn’t get to the mom and pop stores.\nJoe Biden: (05:20)\nSo, you had one in five, one in six minority businesses closing. Many of them permanently. People being laid off. And then what happened was, when the first round of money for unemployment, enhanced unemployment went by, he didn’t do anything. He didn’t do anything. And to the best of my knowledge, and I mean this sincerely, I can’t think of, I’ve been around for a lot of presidents, and you know a lot of presidents in a crisis, I don’t ever remember one never calling the House and Senate Republicans, Democrats together.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (05:52)\nLet’s look forward a little bit. You said that you would lock down the economy, only if the scientists said it was necessary.\nJoe Biden: (05:56)\nBy the way, in the context, would I lock down the economy if science said so? I said I’d follow science. But I don’t think there’s a need to lock down.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (06:05)\nYeah, but I want to press you on that point. You’ve been in the Oval Office for eight years with President Obama, he would always say that only the hard to solve problems-\nJoe Biden: (06:15)\n[crosstalk 00:06:15] Get there.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (06:15)\nWhat is most likely to happen is, the scientists will disagree. The scientists will disagree with the economist. So the question is, how are you going to decide this? Who are you going to listen to? And how can you can contain the pandemic without crushing the economy?\nJoe Biden: (06:28)\nWell, you can contain the pandemic by being rational and not crush economy. For example, I laid out a plan, how you can open businesses. You can open businesses and schools, if in fact you provide them the guidance that they need, as well as the money to be able to do it. What’s happening now is, we know, for example, if you can open a business and you could have a sign on the door saying, “Safe to come in.” And that’s why people aren’t going anyway, when they’re open.\nJoe Biden: (06:52)\nAnd say, because you have social distancing, you have plastic barriers, when you go to the cashier, you have separators between the booths. You don’t have large crowds, you reduce the size, the number of people you can have in the restaurant. You make sure there’s testing, that’s a really critical piece that he didn’t do testing and tracing. And you make sure that people are equipped, going to schools.\nJoe Biden: (07:15)\nYou know, we initially said, the government initially said, they’re going to provide masks for every student and every teacher. Then they said, “No, no, no, no.” FEMA said, the president or whomever said, ‘No, no, no. That’s not a national emergency, not a national emergency.”\nJoe Biden: (07:33)\nWe need more teachers in our schools to be able to open smaller pods. We need ventilation systems change. There’s a lot of things we know now, and I laid them out in some detail. Now again, when I say I laid them out, I’m not an office holder. I’m running for office. It’s not like I’m still Vice President, or I wasn’t a United States Senator pushing this.\nJoe Biden: (07:52)\nSo, I don’t want to say, “I, I, I.” But we did lay out exactly what needed to be done. And take a look, we make up 4% of the world’s population. We have 20% of the world’s deaths. We’re in a situation where we have 210 plus thousand people dead. And what’s he doing? Nothing. He’s still not wearing masks, and so on.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (08:12)\nWe’re getting some other questions on COVID.\nJoe Biden: (08:14)\nSure.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (08:14)\nThe next one comes from Kelly Lee. She’s from Philadelphia.\nJoe Biden: (08:16)\nThank you.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (08:17)\nRepublican. Voted for Donald Trump in 2016.\nKelly Lee: (08:21)\nI did.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (08:21)\nUndecided now.\nJoe Biden: (08:22)\nHey, Kelly. How are you?\nKelly Lee: (08:23)\nHi, Mr. Biden. My question is about the coronavirus vaccine, or potential.\nJoe Biden: (08:29)\nYes.\nKelly Lee: (08:29)\nSenator Harris stated that she absolutely would not take a vaccine from President Trump. And of course, we all know it’s not President Trump that would create this vaccine. It would be doctors and scientists that presumably we all trust. So, my question for you is if a vaccine were approved between now and the end of the year, would you take it? And if you were to become president, would you mandate that everyone has to take it?\nJoe Biden: (08:58)\nTwo things. Number one, President Trump talks about things that just aren’t accurate, about everything from vaccines, we’re going to have one right away, is it going to happen, and so on. The point is that, if the scientists, if the body of scientists say that this is what is ready to be done, and it’s been tested, they’ve gone through the three phases. Yes, I would take it. I’d encourage people to take it.\nJoe Biden: (09:23)\nBut President Trump says things like, everything from this crazy stuff he’s walking away from now, inject bleach in your arm, and that’s going to work. I’m not being facetious, he’s actually said these things. And now, Regeneron is the answer. That’s going to cure everything. There’s 500,000 doses, we have more than a few million people, you know? And so, if you noticed, most of the companies who are developing these vaccines are working, they’re making real progress.\nJoe Biden: (09:53)\nI meet with four leading scientists, at least twice a week. In the beginning, four times a week, giving us the detail on what kind of progress is being made. And right now, they do the right thing. When they run into a serious problem, they halt the test. They don’t continue until they figure out what the problem was. They’re not there yet.\nJoe Biden: (10:11)\nAnd the most scientists say, that it’s not likely to have a vaccine that would be available until the beginning of next year, into the spring of next year. And in the meantime, what I worry about is the same thing with Regeneron, which is a useful antidote. Not antidote, a useful tool. But what’s happening is there was no plan to figure out how to distribute it. We have 500,000 vials of it.\nJoe Biden: (10:41)\nWell, we don’t have all the testing equipment. We don’t have all the ability to get it to the people who need it. And what we should be doing now, and allegedly it’s happening, but I’ve not seen it yet nor the docs that I’ve talked to seen it. There should be a plan when we have the vaccine, how do we distribute it?\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (10:57)\nAnd once we get it, if it’s safe, if it’s effective, will you mandate its use?\nJoe Biden: (11:02)\nThe answer is, depending on how clear… Vaccines, they say, have a very positive impact and that you’re going to affect positively 85% of the American public. Or there’s others say, “This vaccine is really the key. This is the golden key.” It depends on the state of the nature of the vaccine when it comes out, and how it’s being distributed. But I would think that we should be talking about, depending on the continuation of the spread of the virus, we should be thinking about making it mandatory.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (11:38)\nHow would you enforce that?\nJoe Biden: (11:40)\nWell, you couldn’t, that’s the problem. Just like you can’t enforce measles, you can’t come to school unless you have a measles shot. You know, you can’t. But you can’t say, everyone has to do this, just like you can’t mandate a mask. But you can say, you can go to every governor and get them all in a room, all 50 of them as president and say, ” Ask people to wear the mask. Everybody knows.”\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (12:03)\nAnd if they don’t? Fines?\nJoe Biden: (12:03)\nAnd if they don’t, no. Not fine. Then I go to every governor, I go to every mayor, I go to every councilmen, and I go to every local official, say, “Mandate the mask.” Say, “This is what you have to do when you’re out. Make sure you encourage it being done.” Look, George, you and I know, and I think you do too as well, the words of a president matter.\nKelly Lee: (12:25)\nAbsolutely.\nJoe Biden: (12:25)\nNo matter whether they’re good, bad, or indifferent, they matter. And when a president doesn’t wear a mask or makes fun of folks like me, when I was wearing a mask for a long time, then people say, “Well, it mustn’t be that important.” But when a president says, “I think this is very important.” For example, I walked in here with this mask, but I have one of the N95 masks underneath it. I left it in my dressing room. Not the dresser, the room I was in before I got here.\nJoe Biden: (12:53)\nAnd so, I think it matters what we say. And we’re now learning that children are getting the virus, not with as serious consequences, but there’s been no studies done yet on vaccines for children. So, there’s a long way to go, but we can make progress in the meantime and save lives.\nJoe Biden: (13:13)\nAnd the last point I’ll make, if you listen to the head of the CDC, he stood up and he said, “You know, while we’re waiting for a vaccine.” He held up a mask. “You wear this mask, you’ll save more lives between now and the end of the year than if we had a vaccine.” It’s estimated by every major study done from the University of Washington to Columbia, that if in fact we wore masks, we could save, between now and the end of the year, a hundred thousand lives.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:44)\nAnd avoid lock downs?\nJoe Biden: (13:45)\nAnd avoid lockdown, yes. You don’t have to lock down if you’re wearing the mask.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:49)\nLet’s get a question on the economy. Anthony Archer-\nJoe Biden: (13:51)\nThank you, I hope I answered your question.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:53)\n… from Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, it’s a suburb of Pittsburgh. Republican.\nJoe Biden: (13:56)\nI know it.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:56)\nVoted for President Trump.\nAnthony Archer: (13:58)\nThank you, George. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You stated that anyone making less than $400,000 will not see one single penny of their taxes raised.\nJoe Biden: (14:07)\nThat’s right.\nAnthony Archer: (14:07)\nBut also, state that you are going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. The Trump tax cuts reduces taxes for the majority of workers. I would argue, not enough. What is your plan for either extending the tax cuts for the middle-class, or creating a new plan that further reduces those taxes?\nJoe Biden: (14:22)\nI carry this card with me. When I said the Trump tax cuts, about 1.3 trillion of the $2 trillion in his tax cuts went to the top one 10th of 1%. That’s what I’m talking about eliminating, not all the tax cuts that are out there. And by the way, if you take a look, we reduced the corporate tax rate from 35%. and Democrats, Republicans who were in office thought it should come down to 28%. He reduced it to 21%.\nJoe Biden: (14:54)\nYou have 91 out of the Fortune 500 companies not paying a single solitary penny. If you raise the corporate tax back to 28%, which is a fair tax, you’d raise one trillion, three hundred billion dollars by that one act. If you made sure that people making over 400 grand paid what they did in the Bush administration, 39.6%, you would raise another, it goes up to let me get you the exact number here, about another 200, excuse me. $92 billion.\nJoe Biden: (15:29)\nSo, you could raise a lot of money to be able to invest in things that can make your life easier. Make you change your standard of living by making sure you have affordable health care, by making sure you’re in a situation where you’re able to send your kid to school. If you have student debt, you can deal with it. Making sure that your home, you can pay your mortgage. You got 20 million people, right now.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:50)\nMr. Vice President, let me press you on that though.\nJoe Biden: (15:52)\nSure.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:52)\nYou’re going to raise the corporate tax, you’re going to raise taxes on the wealthy. Is it wise to do even that when the economy is as weak as it is right now?\nJoe Biden: (15:59)\nAbsolutely.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (16:00)\nAnother 900, 000 people have filed for unemployment.\nJoe Biden: (16:02)\nThat’s a great question. Moody’s did analysis of my detailed analysis of my tax plan and my economic plan. They said, I will, in four years, Moody’s Wall Street, said I will create 18.6 million new jobs, good paying jobs, number one. Number two, the GDP will grow by a trillion dollars more than would under Trump, and 7 million more jobs than under Trump.\nJoe Biden: (16:31)\nAnd the reason is, when you allow people to get back in the game and have a job, everything moves. Everything moves. Right now, you got the opposite. You had, last year during this pandemic, you had the wealthiest billionaires in the world, in the nation, they made another $700 billion. $700 billion. He talks about a V-shape recovery. It’s a K shape recovery. If you’re on the top, you’re going to do very well. And if you’re in the bottom, or you’re in the middle or the bottom, your income is coming down. You’re not getting a raise.\nJoe Biden: (17:09)\nI shouldn’t, I don’t know what you do. You may get a raise. Hope you’re a billionaire. But all kidding aside, it’s about growing the economy. And George, the way out, the reason why I’m so optimistic about economic recovery, more than I’ve ever been, is we have these four crises happening all at once. And one helps the other. For example, we’re going to invest a great deal of that money into infrastructure, and to a green infrastructure.\nJoe Biden: (17:38)\nWe’re going to put 500,000 charging stations on new highways we’re building, and all highways we’re building. We’re going to own the electric market. You know as well as I do from your days, you know, in the old days, where the president spends about $600 billion a year on government contracts. Everything from making sure they have aircraft carriers, to automobile fleets in the United States.\nJoe Biden: (18:04)\nIf you make, and it’s not in violation of any international trade agreement, made in America. If you actually insist that whatever that product is, made in America, including the material that goes into the product. It is estimated we’re going to create somewhere between another four and six million jobs just by doing that.\nJoe Biden: (18:24)\nBut what’s happening now under his trade policy, a lot of this is going overseas. You get a benefit from going overseas, if you have much of it being made overseas. So, if you send it overseas, you get a 10% tax increase on a product. If you make it in America and you bring it back, you get a 10% growth. If you bring back a company, and you’re going to open up an old facility, you get a 10% tax credit for all you invested. That actually works, George.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (18:53)\nSo, there’s not going to be any delay on the tax increases?\nJoe Biden: (18:56)\nNo, well. I got to get the votes. I got to get the votes. That’s why, the one thing, I have this strange notion. We are a democracy. Some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends, even occasionally say, “Well, if you can’t get the votes by executive order, you’re going to do something. Things you can’t do by executive order, unless you’re a dictator.” We’re democracy, we need consensus.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (19:20)\nGot to take a quick break. We’ll be right back.\nJoe Biden: (19:22)\nI hope I answered your question.\nVoice Over: (19:24)\nWe the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. This special edition of 2020 will return in a moment.\nVoice Over: (23:25)\n(silence) The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. From the Constitution Center in Philadelphia here again, George Stephanopoulos.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (23:46)\nAnd welcome back to our town hall with Joe Biden. We’re going to get a question now from Cedric Humphrey. He’s a student from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Progressive Democrat.\nJoe Biden: (23:53)\nDon’t jump, Cedric. You’re look like you’re way up there.\nCedric Humphrey: (23:56)\nI’ll be okay. Thank you, George. And good evening, former Vice President Biden.\nJoe Biden: (23:59)\nGood evening.\nCedric Humphrey: (24:00)\nMany people believe that the true swing demographic in this election will be-\nCedric Humphrey: (24:03)\nMany people believe that the true swing demographic in this election will be Black voters under the age of 30, not because they’ll be voting for Trump, but because they won’t vote at all. I myself have had this exact same conflict. So my question for you then is, besides “You ain’t Black,” what do you have to say to young Black voters who see voting for you as further participation in a system that continually fails to protect them?\nJoe Biden: (24:24)\nWell, I’d say first of all, as my buddy John Lewis said, “It’s a sacred opportunity, the right to vote. You can make a difference.” If young Black women and men vote, you can determine the outcome of this election. Not a joke. You can do that. Then the next question is, am I worthy of your vote? Can I earn your vote? And the answer is, there’s two things I think that I care and I’ve demonstrated I care about my whole career. One is, in addition to dealing with a criminal justice system to make it fairer and make it more decent, we have to be able to put Black Americans in a position to be able to gain wealth, generate wealth. And so you look at what that entails.\nJoe Biden: (25:02)\nIt entails everything from early education, that’s why I’m supporting making sure that Title One schools, as you know, schools with the least tax base to be able to support their schools, I increased the funding from them from $15 to $45 billion. That allows every teacher in that school to make up to 60,000 bucks, and the problem now is they’re leaving the schools. They’re not there. We’re short about a million and a half teachers, a million and a quarter teachers.\nJoe Biden: (25:29)\nNumber two, every three and four and five-year-old will go to school, school, not daycare, school, and with all the great universities, including the one you’ve gone to, go to, or went to, in fact, talks about in the last eight years, what’s happened. What happens when you let them go to school? They make up rapidly whatever shortcoming they had in terms of their education prior to that. They have not heard as many words spoken, et cetera, et cetera. What happens is that, the studies show, that 58% will increase by 58% their chance of going all through 12 years of school, and going through successfully. It will also provide for the ability to bring in social workers and school psychologists. We have one school psychologist in America now for every 1,507 kids. It should be one to 500, not just in schools that are poor, but in all schools, because we learned that, for example, drug abuse doesn’t cause mental illness, mental illness causes drug abuse, the failure to get hold of people and deal with their anxieties.\nJoe Biden: (26:34)\nIn addition to that, I provide for a $70 billion for HBC use for them to be able to have the wherewithal to do what other universities can do, because they don’t have the kind of foundational support they need. And so that would allow them, for example, like we did in our administration, the President allowed me to go down and we awarded a cybersecurity laboratory, ability to compete for cybersecurity laboratory. The federal government spends billions of dollars a year on universities, because there are the best kept secret and where most of the major inventions come out of. And so that school now will be able to produce young Black women and men who are going to go into a field of the future that’s burgeoning, cybersecurity. And that’s what is going to help a great deal.\nJoe Biden: (27:18)\nIn addition to that, if you’re a young man about to graduate and you graduated from school and you want to own your first home, well, it’s awful hard to get the money, depending on the background, where your economic background is, to get a down payments. So we’re going to guarantee first term home buyers a $15,000 down payment for first term home buyers. In addition to that, all the studies now show, and I’ve been arguing this for a long time, is young Black entrepreneurs are just as successful as White entrepreneurs or anyone else given a shot. But you can’t get the money. Where do you go to get the startup money? So what President Obama and I did, we had a program where we took $1.5 billion and we invested it in all the SBAs around the country, and the state SBAs, small business associations, and that generated $30 billion came off the sideline.\nJoe Biden: (28:11)\nBecause if you have a guarantee of $200,000 for your new startup enterprise, a young entrepreneur, you’re going to be able to attract, if it’s government money and it’s a guarantee, you could be able to attract another $100,000. It generated $30 billion. Well, I’m changing that program and I’ll get this done without much trouble I believe in the Congress from $1.5 million to $30 billion. That’ll take $300 billion off the sideline and grow. And, for example, if you, in fact, and I were the same age and we split our differences, if we were the same age, and we went to the same builder to buy us each the same home, but my home was in a White neighborhood on one side of a highway, and yours is in a Black neighborhood, same exact home, your home will start off being valued 29% less than my home. Yet your insurance for that home will be higher. You’ll be taxed more for it. We’ve got to end this. That’s what got me involved in politics in the first place, a thing called red lining.\nJoe Biden: (29:15)\nWe can change so much that we can do so much to change the circumstances to give people a real opportunity.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (29:22)\nCedric. Is that right? Did you hear what you needed here?\nCedric Humphrey: (29:27)\nI think so.\nJoe Biden: (29:29)\nWell, there’s a lot more if you’re going to hang around afterwards. I’ll tell you more.\nCedric Humphrey: (29:32)\nOkay.\nJoe Biden: (29:33)\nNo, but I really mean it. It’s the key. Look, this is the way every other … Like my dad, he lost his job up in Scranton and it took him three years to be able to move down to Delaware, to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town, and send us home to our grandpop to live with him. We finally got back. We lived in an apartment, which became six and eight housing much later. It was just normal apartments. But it took him five years to be able to buy a home. Well, we bought a three bedroom home with four kids and a grandpop living with us, but it accumulated wealth. You built up wealth. That’s how middle-class folks make it. They build up wealth. Then he was able to borrow a little against that to be able to help us get the school, those kinds of things. It’s about accumulating wealth and you’re behind an eight ball. The vast majority of people of color are behind an eight ball.\nJoe Biden: (30:24)\nAnd it’s the same way what’s going on now with all this money that’s been voted. What’s happened? You go to the bank, if you’re a Black businessman, and the President fired the only Inspector General to see oversee all this help coming from the Congress. And what happens? You go in and they say, “Ah, do you have an account here?” “No.” “Do you have a credit card?” “No.” “Have you borrowed from us before ?” “No.” We bailed these suckers out. They’re not liable for any of the money, but they still won’t lend it to you. We’ve got to change that. It’s about accumulating wealth.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (30:57)\nI want to get another question in here from Angelica Politarhos.\nJoe Biden: (30:59)\nI’m sorry.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (31:00)\nNo, not at all. Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania.\nAngelia Politarhos: (31:02)\nHi.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (31:02)\nRepublican who voted for President Trump last time.\nAngelia Politarhos: (31:05)\nThank you. Thank you, George. Thank you, Vice President Biden. Nice to meet you. What’s your view on the Crime Bill that you wrote 1994, which showed prejudice against minorities? Where do you stand today on that?\nJoe Biden: (31:17)\nWell, first of all, things have changed drastically. That Crime Bill, when it voted, the Black Caucus voted for it. Every Black mayor supported it across the board and the Crime Bill itself did not have mandatory sentences except for two things. It had three strikes and you’re out, which I voted against, in the Crime Bill, but it had a lot of other things in it that turned out to be both bad and good. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. That was part of the assault weapons ban and other things that were good. What I was against was giving states more money for prison systems that they could build, state prison systems. And you have 93 out of every 100 people in jail now is in a state prison, not in a federal prison, because they built more prisons.\nJoe Biden: (31:58)\nI also wrote into that bill a thing called drug courts. I don’t believe anybody should be going to jail for drug use. They should be going into mandatory rehabilitation. We should be building rehab centers to have these people housed. We should decriminalize marijuana, wipe out the record so you can actually say honesty, “You ever been arrested for murder for anything?” You can say no, because we’re going to pass a law saying there is no background that you have to reveal relative to the use of marijuana. And so there’s a lot of things. But in addition to that, we’ve got to change the system. I joined with a group of people in the House to provide for changing the system from punishment to rehabilitation. Along with a guy named Marlon Specter, who you may remember, I wrote the Second Chance Act.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (32:49)\nIn the meantime, an awful lot of people were jailed for minor drug crimes after the Crime Bill.\nJoe Biden: (32:53)\nRight.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (32:54)\nWas it a mistake to support it?\nJoe Biden: (32:55)\nYes, it was. But here’s where the mistake. The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally. What we did federally, we said, you remember, George, it was all about the same time for the same crime. What I had done as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I took the 10 Circuit Courts of Appeals, took some really brilliant lawyers working for me in Judiciary, we did a study and we determined what happens if, for the first, second, third offense for any crime in the criminal justice system at the federal level, if you’re a Black man and it’s the first time you’ve committed robbery, how long would you go to jail? On average? If you’re White man, how long? The Black man would go to jail on average 13 years. White man, two years. I’d go down the list of every single crime.\nJoe Biden: (33:42)\nSo we set up a sentencing commission. We didn’t set the time. Every single solitary maximum was reduced in there. But what happened was it became the same time for the same crime. So it said, “You have to serve between one and three years.” And it ended up becoming much lower, Black folks went to jail a lot less than they would have before. But it was a mistake.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (34:05)\nLet me ask another follow-up on the Crime bill. It also funded 100,000 police back in 1994. You’ve often said that more cops clearly mean less crime. Do you still believe that?\nJoe Biden: (34:15)\nYes, if in fact they’re involved in community policing, not jump squads. For example, when we had community policing, from the mid-’90s on until till Bush got elected, what happened? Violent crime actually went down precipitous. Remember the significant rise in violent crime that was occurring in the late ’80s into the ’90s. It went down and fewer African Americans were arrested because you had the requirement. The cops didn’t like it. They didn’t like the community policing, because you had to have two people in the vehicle, they had to get out of their cars, they had to introduce themselves to who own the local liquor store, who owned the local grocery store, who was the woman on the corner. And what they would do, George, they’d actually go and give people their phone numbers. A cop would give the phone number.\nJoe Biden: (35:02)\nSo if Nelly Smith was on the second floor where drug deals took place and things happened below her apartment, she could call and say, “It’s Millie, and there’s something going on here.” And they’d never revealed it was her, because they’d know, if she knew that, in fact, they report, they’d never report the crime, she’d never report. So it actually started to come down. And what happened? They eliminated the funding for community policing. Community policing doesn’t mean more people coming in, in armored Humvees and swarming. It turned out that by the time we got to the late ’90s and crime had come down so much, the mayors and everybody asked the question, “Where do you want me to spend the money?” They say, “Well, only 1% thought violent crime was a problem.” It was as high as 22%.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (35:48)\nRight now we have a systemic problem. How do you get the kind of policing, prevent the kind of policing [crosstalk 00:35:55].\nJoe Biden: (35:53)\nYou have to change the way in which they [inaudible 00:35:55]. One of the things I’m going to do, George, is what is set up a national study group made up of cops, social workers, as well as made up of the Black community and the Brown community to sit down in the White House and over the next year come up with significant reforms that need to take place within communities. You have to bring them together. One of the things I’ve observed is, the neighborhood I grew up, I grew up in Claymont, you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn’t qualified much to do any one of them, but here’s the deal, all kidding aside. Most cops don’t like bad cops.\nAngelia Politarhos: (36:34)\nCorrect.\nJoe Biden: (36:34)\nThey don’t like it.\nAngelia Politarhos: (36:35)\nThat’s correct.\nJoe Biden: (36:36)\nAnd so what happens is they get intimidated into not reporting. So one of the things we do is there has to be transparency available. We have to be able to go in at the federal level, be able to go in and check out whether or not there’s systematic problems within police departments. If, in fact, a cop needs to be tried, it’s not the prosecutor in the community, in the district there. You’ve got to go outside the community to get another prosecutor to come in to handle the crime. There’s a lot of things we’ve learned, and it takes time but we can do this. You can ban choke holds, but beyond that, you have to teach people how to de-escalate circumstances. De-escalate. So instead of anybody coming at you and the first thing you do is shoot to kill, you shoot them in the leg. There’s ways you have to do more background checks in terms of whether or not the person coming in, passes a certain psychological test.\nJoe Biden: (37:29)\nAnd the last thing I’ll say, and I’m sorry, but it’s really, I think, really, really important, is you have to be in a position where you are able to identify, identify the things that have to change. And one of the things that has to change is so many cops get called into circumstances where somebody is mentally off. Like what happened not long ago, that guy with the knife. That’s why we have to provide within police departments psychologists and social workers to go out with the cops on those calls, some of those 911 calls to de-escalate the circumstance, to deal with talking them down. But cops are kind of like school teachers now. A school teacher has to know everything from how to handle hunger in a household as well as how to teach how to read. Well, cops or don’t have that breadth, and there’s a lot of things we can do. We shouldn’t be defunding cops. We should be mandating the things that we should be doing within police departments and make sure there’s total transparency.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (38:34)\nGot to take another quick break. We’ll be right back.\nJoe Biden: (38:36)\nI don’t know the answer to your question.\nSpeaker 1: (43:09)\nHe shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States. From the Constitution Center in Philadelphia, here again, George Stephanopoulos.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (43:28)\nAnd the Supreme Court is our next topic. The questioner, Nathan Osburn of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Democrat.\nNathan Osburn: (43:35)\nHi, I’m George and Mr. Vice President.\nJoe Biden: (43:36)\nHey, Nathan.\nNathan Osburn: (43:38)\nOur country’s first Supreme Court gave its first ruling is just two blocks from here from 1791 to 1800, and it’s become more polarized since then. Merrick Garland didn’t get a hearing for all of 2016 and Amy Coney Barrett is being pushed through at the last minute, even though millions have already voted. So what do you think about ideas from people like Pete Buttigieg and others to put in place safeguards that will help ensure more long-term balance and stability? And what do you say to LGBTQ Americans and others who are very worried right now about erosions of their rights and our democracy as a whole?\nJoe Biden: (44:13)\nWell, let me start at the last point and work my way back. I think there’s great reason to be concerned. I was on the road most of the time during these hearings so I didn’t hear many of them. I just got the recaps when I’d get in late at night. I’m been going around the country, Florida, anyway, but my reading online what the judge said was she didn’t answer very many questions at all. And I don’t even think she is laid out much of a judicial philosophy in terms of the basis upon which she thinks [inaudible 00:44:48] in the Constitution, nonetheless. So, number one. So I think there’s great reason to be concerned for the LGBT community, something I fought very hard for, for a long time to make sure there’s equality across the board.\nJoe Biden: (45:01)\nNumber two, I think that also healthcare overall is very much in jeopardy as a consequence of the President’s going to go directly after this election directly to the Supreme Court within a month to try to get Obamacare wiped out after 10 million people have already lost her insurance from their employer and wants to take 20 million people out of the system as well, plus 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. So there’s a lot at stake. I don’t think it’s appropriate. I think the Constitution implies, there’s no provision in the Constitution, my problem is I made a mistake of teaching constitutional law for 21 years, and the separation of powers, the Constitution implies that their way the people have a right to determine who’s going to be on the court is how they vote for their Senators and their President. We seek the advice and consent of the Senate. And the President-\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (45:52)\nThe President is President for all four years, isn’t he?\nJoe Biden: (45:54)\nHe is. But once an election begins, by implication, it is inconsistent with the constitutional principles, in my view. You get disagreement among scholars on this, but I believe it’s inconsistent when millions of people have already voted to put someone on the Court. I think it should have been held until this election is over, see what the makeup of the Senate is going to be. If the President wins this election, he should be able to go for it.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (46:22)\nBut how about that question of expanding the court? Here’s what you said exactly one year ago tonight at a Democratic debate. You said, “I would not get into court packing. I would not pack the court.” That’s not what you’re saying now. Is the nomination of Judge Barrett reason enough to rethink your position?\nJoe Biden: (46:36)\nWhat I wanted to do, George, you know if I had answered the question directly then all the focus would be on, what’s Biden going to do if he wins? Instead of on, is it appropriate what is going on now? And it should stay. This is the thing that the President loves to do, always take our eye off the ball what’s at stake. One of the things Pete has suggested is, and there’s a number of constitutional scholars have suggested as well, that there are at least four or five options that are available to determine whether or not you can change the way in which the court lifetime appointment takes place consistent arguably with the Constitution. I have not been a fan of court packing because then it just generates what will happen. Whoever wins, it just keeps moving in a way that is inconsistent with what is going to be manageable.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (47:25)\nSo you’re still not a fan?\nJoe Biden: (47:26)\nWell, I’m not a fan. It depends on how this turns out. Not how he wins, but how it’s handled, how it’s handled. But there’s a number of things that are going to be coming up and there’s going to be a lot of discussion about other alternative as well.\nGeorge Stephanopoulus: (47:40)\nWhat does that mean, how it’s handled? How will that determine [crosstalk 00:23:42].\nJoe Biden: (47:43)\nFor example, there’s actually real live debate on the floor, if people are really going to be able to have a time to go through this. I don’t know anybody who’s gone on the floor that’s been a controversial justice in terms of making fundamentally or altering the makeup of the court that’s gone through in a day kind of thing. I mean, it depends on …\nJoe Biden: (48:03)\n… and the makeup of the court has gone through in a day kind of thing. I mean, it depends on how much they rushed this. And you think about it, George, here you got a lot of people not to be able to pay their mortgage, not being able to put food on the table, not being able to keep their business open, not being able to do anything to deal with what’s going on in terms of the economy as a consequence of COVID and they have no time to deal with that, but they have time to rush this through.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (48:22)\nWell, right now it looks like they’re going to have a vote around Halloween. So if they vote on it, [crosstalk 00:48:26] for the election. If they vote on it before the election, you are open to expanding the court?\nJoe Biden: (48:31)\nI’m open to considering what happens from that point on.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (48:36)\nYou know, you said so many times during the campaign, all through the course of your career, it’s important to level with [crosstalk 00:48:41]\nJoe Biden: (48:40)\nIt is. Good choice. No matter what answer I gave you, if I say it, that’s the headline tomorrow. It won’t be about what’s going on now, the improper way they’re proceeding.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (48:51)\nBut don’t voters have a right to know where you stand?\nJoe Biden: (48:52)\nThey do have a right to know what I stand and they’ll have a right to know where I stand before they vote.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (48:57)\nSo you’ll come out with a clear position before election day?\nJoe Biden: (48:59)\nYes. Depending on how they handle this. But look, what you should do is you got to make sure you vote and vote for a senator who in fact reflects your general view on constitutional interpretation, and vote for a president who thinks is more in line with you. And if you oppose the position that I would not have appointed her, but if you oppose my position, vote for Trump, vote for Republican who shares that view, but that’s your opportunity to get involved in lifetime appointments that have presidents come and go, justices stay and stay and stay.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (49:36)\nYou have a question from a Republican, Andrew Lewis. I would guess a disaffected Republican. You cast a write-in vote for John Kasich in 2016. You’re going to vote against President Trump this year.\nJoe Biden: (49:46)\nJohn’s writing in for me, by the way.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (49:48)\nI know that.\nJoe Biden: (49:51)\nI’m sorry.\nAndrew Lewis: (49:52)\nMr. Vice President, my father Drew Lewis served as secretary of transportation under President Ronald Reagan in his first time.\nJoe Biden: (49:58)\nOh yeah, I’ll be darned.\nAndrew Lewis: (49:59)\nAnd some of his closest allies and friends were Democrats, including House Speaker Tip O’Neill and Senator Ted Kennedy. Sadly, today we have highly partisan and dysfunctional governance. And I believe President Trump is primarily responsible for creating this toxic environment. As president, how will you avoid the temptation to exact revenge and instead take the high road and attempt to restore bipartisanship, civility, and honor to our democracy?\nJoe Biden: (50:29)\nIt was written by a fellow who won the Pulitzer prize for a book he wrote about the presidency. He said I doubt whether Biden is really Irish. He doesn’t hold a grudge. In politics, grudges don’t work. They make no sense. I really mean it. I have never, and the second point I’d make is everybody talks about, “Yeah, Joe, when you were a senator and a chairman of foreign relations or chairman of judiciary, you got a lot of things done. You’re able to cross the aisle but the days are changed. When you’re vice president, you got a lot done, but it can’t happen anymore.” It can. We got to change the nature of the way we deal with one another. And it starts off by the way your father was and Tip was and others. You don’t question another man or woman’s motive. You can question their judgment, but not their motive. We badly needed an infrastructure bill.\nJoe Biden: (51:19)\nWell, what happens? I stand up and I say, “We need an infrastructure bill, Senator, but I tell you what, you’re in the pocket of the cement industry, but let’s see what we can do.” He can’t get anywhere. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. I learned that lesson a long time ago. I’ve never, even when it’s obvious on its face what the motive is, stick to the subject and listen to the other guy. Listen, what I will be doing as, if I’m elected president and the first thing and not a joke. And you can ask if they’d tell you, your dad’s old friends in the Republican side, I’m going to pick up the phone and call them and say, “Let’s get together. We’ve got to figure out how we’re going to move forward here.”\nJoe Biden: (51:55)\nBecause there’s so many things we really do agree on. And with Trump out of the way, the vindictiveness of a president going after Republicans who don’t do exactly what he says gets taken away. There’s going to be, I promise you, between four and eight Republican senators who are going to be willing to move on things where there’s bipartisan consensus. Last example I’ll give you. After Trump had been elected, named the next president, wasn’t sworn in yet, I’ve been working on a thing called a bill relating to cancer cures. Okay? And it was called the Cancer Moonshot. And I work with a number of Democrats and Republicans. And we had a bill that was about $9 billion that made significant increases in research and development on cancer alternatives, NIH and particularly specific cancer initiatives. And we only had at the time I think it was 111 or 114, whatever it was, votes in the house. I don’t hold any exact number.\nJoe Biden: (52:58)\nAnd we had fewer than 40 in the Senate, but after he was elected, I got those people together as vice president and we sat down and we worked it out and we ended up getting a pass 396 votes in the house and 94 votes in the Senate. And at the end of the day, because it had to do with the Biden Cancer Moonshot I’ve been working on, Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell stood up and I was presiding officer and moved to name the bill after my deceased son, Beau, who had just died. So, there are ways to bring this together.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (53:33)\nBut how about the question of political accountability? Is there some tension between that and bringing people together? Robert Mueller laid out a lot of evidence of possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. What would a Biden Justice Department do with that evidence?\nJoe Biden: (53:47)\nWhat the Biden Justice Department will do is let the Department of Justice be the Department of Justice. Let them make the judgments of who should be prosecuted. They’re not my lawyers. They’re not my personal lawyer.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (54:01)\nSo, you’re not going to rule it in or rule it out?\nJoe Biden: (54:03)\nI’m not going to rule in or out. Well, I’m going to hire really first rate prosecutors and people who understand the law like Democrat and Republican administrations have had, and let them make the judgements, but turning this into a vehicle for your, as if it’s your own law firm, you don’t own that justice department. You pick the best people you can and you hope that what they’re going to do is they’re going to enforce the law as they see it. But can you remember any Republican president going out there or former Democratic president go find that guy and prosecute him? Remember, where you hear that? Or by the way, I’m being sued because a woman has accused me of rape. Represent me. Represent me. Personally represent me in the state of New York on my not allowing my tax returns. What’s that all about? What is that about?\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (54:52)\nGot to take another break. We’ll be right back.\nSpeaker 2: (54:58)\nThe executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years and together with the vice president chosen for the- From the constitution center in Philadelphia, here again, George Stephanopoulos.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (59:51)\nAnd welcome back to our town hall with Former Vice President Joe Biden. We’re going to look at the environment right now. We’re going to get a question from Michele Ellison and from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, businesswoman, a social worker. You’re a Republican who’s voted for Democrats, but you’re not sure what you’re going to do this time around. Correct?\nMichele Ellison: (01:00:06)\nCorrect. Greetings Former Vice President Biden.\nJoe Biden: (01:00:11)\nHello.\nMichele Ellison: (01:00:12)\nThank you, Mr. Stephanopoulos. In a 2012 report of the University of Pittsburgh’s Institute of Politics fracking was discussed and it is possible implications for the waterways from the Commonwealth to the gulf. Fracking has made the population sick and killed wildlife in Southwest Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and small business development centers have already begun to transition people away from fossil fuels. What industries that are not harmful to human health and the environment are you planning for Southwest Pennsylvania and the nation?\nJoe Biden: (01:00:50)\nWell, first of all, I make it clear. I do not propose banning fracking. I think you have to make sure that fracking is in fact not emitting methane or polluting the well or dealing with what can be small earthquakes in how they’re drilling. So, it has to be managed very, very well, number one. Number two, what we have to do is the future rests in renewable energy. The single fastest growing energy source in the world right now, because I’m going to say something that’s going to sound self-serving, but I manage the RecoveryAact and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost per BTU of wind and solar. So now it’s cheaper than coal, is cheaper than oil right now, and it has great, great promise. And it’s also the fastest growing employer in the energy industry.\nJoe Biden: (01:01:47)\nAnd so there are a number of things that I would do immediately. Number one, there are well over 100,000 wells that are left uncapped in the region. We could hire 128,000 of these people who are working in the industry to cap these wells and get a good salary doing it now, number one. Number two, we should be moving toward finding the new technologies that are going to be able to deal with carbon capture. So, ultimately, it’s a transition we moved from, to a net zero emission of carbon that we’re still going to be able to use if we find the right technology, some gases, some gas to be able to, if we can carbon capture.\nJoe Biden: (01:02:28)\nAnd I think we’re going to be able to move in a direction where by the year 2035, we’ll be able to have net zero emissions of carbon from the creation of energy, energy creation so we can move it by dealing with those. And every time we talk about global warming or the environment, the president thinks it’s a joke and I think as jobs, because what we’re going to have happened is you’ll be able to see now, as I started to say before. I as president is going to invest that $600 billion that we spend in government contracts, only on those things that in fact also are not only made in America, but building an infrastructure that’s clean and new.\nJoe Biden: (01:03:14)\nAnd what we have to do is focus on the transmission of energy across the country from areas relating to solar and wind. The reason is that they have not, that has not been mastered yet. I met a lot of people in Silicon Valley. The battery technology is increasing significantly so you’re going to be able to have, for example, solar on your home and a battery the, this by this by this, as I’m showing you here in your basement. So when the sun doesn’t shine for five days, you still have enough energy. So, we’re making significant progress.\nJoe Biden: (01:03:48)\nThe other thing we’re going to do is provide an awful lot of work. It’s estimated to put close to a million people to work by weatherizing four million buildings and two million homes, because we’ll save tons and tons of energy or billions of barrels of energy over time. And at the same time provide significant employment and a good union wages, prevailing wages.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:04:11)\nLet me stick on fracking for a second day. You said you don’t want to ban fracking. As you know, it’s an important issue here in Pennsylvania. Not everyone buys your denial. A member of the Boilermakers Local 154 Shawn Steffee was quoted in the New York Times today saying “You can’t have it both ways.” It says, “You can’t meet your goal to end fossil fuels without ending fracking.” What do you say to people like Shawn who doubt your denial because they think you want to keep that promise [crosstalk 01:04:34]?\nJoe Biden: (01:04:34)\n[crosstalk 01:04:34] Boilermaker’s overwhelming endorsement. Okay? So, the Boilermakers Union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went in a great detail with leadership exactly what I would do, number one. Number two, what I would do is I would giving tax breaks and subsidizing oil. We don’t need to subsidize oil any longer, number one. We should stop that and save billions of dollars over time. What I would also do with regard to there’s no, the difference between me and the new green deal, they say automatically by 2030 we’re going to be carbon free. Not possible.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:05:09)\nSo, are you for or against it? You say you’re not for it, but in your website, it says you call it a crucial framework, the green deal.\nJoe Biden: (01:05:16)\nMy deal is a crucial framework, but not the new green deal. The new green deal calls for elimination of all non renewable energy by 2030. You can’t get there. You’re going to need to be able to transition, George, to be able to transition to get to the place where we invest in new technologies that allow us to do things that get us to a place where we get to net zero emission, including in agriculture. I’ve laid out a detailed plan. We should be taking the plan where we allow significant more land to be put in conservation, plant deep rooted plants which absorb carbon from the air and in fact, pay farmers to do it. We can do things like pelletize all the chicken manure and all the horse manure and cow manure, and take out the methane and use it as fertilizer and make a lot of money doing it.\nJoe Biden: (01:06:06)\nFor example, right now, down in … And people when I say that, they wonder what I’m talking about. The biggest carbon sink in the world is the Amazon. More carbon absorbed from the air diminishing global warming in the Amazon than all the carbon emitted on a yearly basis from the United States of America from all vehicles on all means. So we have to use our imaginations. We have to move in the direction as well providing for electric vehicles. Electric vehicles will save billions of gallons of oil, [inaudible 01:06:38] estimated, not me, Wall street, one million automobile jobs, but we’re lagging me. I mean, we’re not investing. We’re not doing any of the research.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:06:48)\nGot to take another quick break. We’ll be right back. Welcome back to our town hall with Former Vice President Joe Biden. The next question comes from Mark Hoffman, Center Valley, Pennsylvania, conservative, who voted for Trump in 2016.\nMark Hoffman: (01:11:30)\nWelcome to Pennsylvania, Mr. Vice President.\nJoe Biden: (01:11:33)\nGood to be back home. I’m from Pennsylvania.\nMark Hoffman: (01:11:34)\nYes, I know. Scranton, right?\nJoe Biden: (01:11:36)\nYep.\nMark Hoffman: (01:11:37)\nSo, pieces breaking out all over the world. Our troops are coming home. Serbia is talking to Kosovo and the Arabs and Israelis are talking peace which I believe is a modern day miracle what’s going on. Does President Trump’s foreign policy deserves some credit?\nJoe Biden: (01:11:57)\nA little more, but not a whole lot. We find ourselves in a position where we’re more isolated in the world than we’ve ever been. Our allies-\nJoe Biden: (01:12:03)\nWere more isolated in the world than we ever have been. Our allies… Our go it alone, our America first has made America alone. You have Iran closer to having enough nuclear material to build a bomb. North Korea has more bombs and missiles available to it. We find ourselves where our NATO allies are publicly saying they can’t count on us. We’re in a situation as well, where in the far East, we find ourselves, in the Western Pacific, where we’re isolated as well. You have Japan and South Korea at odds with one another. China is making moves. So I would say, we’re find ourselves less secure than we’ve been. I do compliment the president on the deal with Israel recently. But if you take a look, we’re not very well trusted around the world. When 17 major nations in the world were asked who they trust more, who’s a better leader, and the president came in behind both, the international survey, both behind Putin, as well as Xi. And look what Putin is doing. You have bounties on American militaries heads in Afghanistan. They have more people there now, by the way, than when we left in Afghanistan. And we find ourselves in a situation where he’s talked to Putin six times, hadn’t said a word to him. And NATO is on the risk of beginning crack because they doubt whether we’re there. You see what’s happened in everything from Belarus to Poland, to Hungary, and the rise of totalitarian regimes in the world. And as well as, this president embraces all the thugs in the world. He’s best friends with the leader of North Korea, sending love letters.\nJoe Biden: (01:13:57)\nHe doesn’t take on Putin in any way. He’s learned the art of the steal from the art of the deal by Xi and China. So I would respectfully suggest, no, there is no plan, no coherent plan for foreign policy. We’ve been most effective as a world leader, in my humble opinion, not just by the exercise of our power. We’re the most powerful nation in the world, but the power of our example. That’s what’s led the rest of the world to follow us on almost everything. He’s pulled out of almost every international organization. He gets laughed at, literally, not figuratively, when he goes to the United Nations. It’s not about the president, per se. It’s about the nation and the lack of respect that’s shown to us.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:14:55)\nWant to get one more question in this segment, and it comes from Mieke Haeck. She’s from State College, Pennsylvania. This is your first presidential election that you’re vote in.\nMieke Haeck: (01:15:03)\nIt is.\nJoe Biden: (01:15:04)\nHi, Mieke. How are you?\nMieke Haeck: (01:15:06)\nI’m good. Thank you. I’m the proud mom of two girls, 8 and 10. My youngest daughter is transgender. The Trump administration has attacked the rights of transgender people, banning them from military service, weakening non-discrimination protections, and even removing the word transgender from some government websites. How will you, as president, reverse this dangerous and discriminatory agenda and ensure that the lives and rights of LGBTQ people are protected under US law?\nJoe Biden: (01:15:51)\nI will flat out just change the law. Eliminate those executive orders, number one. You may recall, I’m the guy who said… I was raised by a man who, I remember, I was being dropped off. My dad was a high school educated, well-read man who was a really decent guy. And I was being dropped off to get an application in the center of our city, Wilmington, Delaware, the corporate capital of the world at the time. I’m getting out to get an application to be a lifeguard in the African-American community, because there was a big swimming pool complex.\nJoe Biden: (01:16:26)\nAnd these two men, well-dressed, leaned up and hugged one another and kissed one another. I’m getting out of the car at the light, and I turned to my dad. My dad looked me. He said, “Joey, it’s simple. They love each other.” The idea that an 8 year old child or a 10 year old child decides, “I decided I want to be transgender. That’s what I think I’d like to be. It’d make my life a lot easier.” There should be zero discrimination. And what’s happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered. They’re being murdered. I think it’s up to, now, 17. Don’t hold me to that number, but it’s… It’s higher now?\nMieke Haeck: (01:17:04)\nYeah.\nJoe Biden: (01:17:04)\nAnd that’s just this year. And so I promise you, there is no reason to suggest that there should be any right denied your daughter, or daughters, whichever, one or two.\nMieke Haeck: (01:17:17)\nOne.\nJoe Biden: (01:17:18)\nOne. Your daughter, that your other daughter has a right to be and do. None. Zero. And by the way, my son Beau, who passed away, was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. He was the guy who got the first transgender law passed in the state of Delaware. And because of a young man who became a woman, who worked for him in the attorney general’s office.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:17:40)\nWe’ve got one more segment coming up. Thank you.\nJoe Biden: (01:17:43)\nAnd I’m proud of her.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:17:44)\nWe’ll be right back.\nSpeaker 3: (01:21:58)\nThe vice president and the people, a special edition of 2020. Here again, George Stephanopoulos.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:22:07)\nAnd welcome back to our town hall with former Vice President Joe Biden. The next question comes from Keenan Wilson, Narberth, Pennsylvania, Democrat.\nKeenan Wilson: (01:22:15)\nGood evening. You say that you committed to entering this race after the events of Charlottesville in 2017. I assume that that feeling that prompted you to run will not go away once the results are determined. So hypothetically, if you lose, how will you use your platform to urge President Donald Trump, and those rallying behind him, towards the ideals of a more perfect union?\nJoe Biden: (01:22:44)\nWell, to be very honest with you, I think that’s very hard. Things have not let themselves to him learning from what’s happened, what’s gone before. Instead of being chastened by being one of the few presidents, the only president to be impeached and then have a member of his own party vote to expel him, it emboldened him. But what I will do… Hopefully, I’ll go back to being a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. And making the case that I’ve been made, and at the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware, focusing on these same issues, relating to what constitutes decency and honor in this country. It’s the thing that got me involved in public life to begin with. As a kid, I’d moved from Scranton, where there were no African-Americans and moved down to Claymont, Delaware.\nJoe Biden: (01:23:44)\nAnd in Delaware we have the eight largest Black population, as a percent of population. It was an epiphany for me seeing what was going on, and I got deeply involved. I’m no great shakes. I wasn’t John Lewis. I don’t mean to imply that. But it’s the thing that’s motivated… My dad used to have an expression for real. He said, “Everyone’s entitled to be treated with dignity. Everybody.” And it was real. Everybody is. And so whether I’m a defeated candidate for president back teaching or I’m elected president, it is a major element of everything that I’m about, because it reflects who we are as a nation.\nJoe Biden: (01:24:26)\nEvery single solitary generation, the dial has moved closer and closer and more and more to inclusion. And we are a country that is a country of slaves who came here 400 years ago, Indigenous people, and everyone else is an immigrant. And we’re a diverse country. And unless we are able to treat people equally, we’re just never going to meet our potential. But I think the American people want to see that happen. I think they’re ready to see it happen. And I’d tell you one thing, if I’m elected president, you will not hear me race baiting. You’ll not hear me dividing. You’ll hear me trying to unify, and bring people together. When I said I was running because I wanted to unify the country, people said, “Well, there are the old days.” We better be able to do it again.\nKeenan Wilson: (01:25:10)\nAgreed.\nJoe Biden: (01:25:10)\nWe’d better be able to do it again.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:25:11)\nMr. Vice President, if you lose, what will that say to you about where America is today?\nJoe Biden: (01:25:16)\nWell, it could say I’m a lousy candidate, and I didn’t do a good job. But I hope that it doesn’t say that we are as racially, ethnically, and religiously at odds with one another as it appears the president wants us to be. Usually, the president’s in my view, with all due respect, has been divide and conquer. The way he does better if he splits us. There’s division. And I think people need hope. Look, George, I’ve never been more optimistic about the prospect for this country than I am today. And I really mean that. I think the people are ready. They understand what’s at stake, and it’s not about Democrat or Republican. If I get elected, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to be an American president. I’m going to take care of those who voted against me, as well as those who voted for me, for real. That’s a presence too. We got to heal this nation, because we have the greatest opportunity to any country in the world to own the 21st century. And we can’t do it divided.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:26:28)\nOne more break. We’ll be right back. And we are wrapping up our town hall with former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Vice President, as you know, President Trump had a town hall meeting tonight, as well. During that town hall meeting, he was asked several times whether he took a COVID test the day of your last debate. You’re supposed to have another debate a week from tonight. Just two quick questions. Do you expect that debate to happen? Will you demand that President Trump take a test that day and that it be negative before you debate?\nJoe Biden: (01:30:49)\nYeah. And by the way, before I came up here, I took another test. I’ve been taking them every day, the deep test, the ones that go in most. Because if I had not passed that test, I didn’t want to come here and expose anybody. And I just think it’s just decency, to be able to determine whether or not you’re clear. I’m less concerned about me, but then the guys with the cameras, the people working in the Secret Service guys you drive up with, all those people. And so, yes, I believe he will do that. Look, I’m going to abide by what the commission rules call for. I was prepared to debate him remotely, which was supposed to happen. And he said he wouldn’t do that, a virtual debate, or a town hall. He didn’t want to do that. I didn’t set those rules. The commission set the rules. So whatever rules they set, I’m confident that the Cleveland Clinic is the one overseeing it. I think they’re going to not let happen what happened last time. They’re going to demand that it’s safe.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:32:00)\nBut you expect to be there?\nJoe Biden: (01:32:01)\nI expect to be there.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:32:02)\nMr. Vice President, thank you for your time tonight. Thanks to all the questioners here. It was really terrific questions. I think you did a service to our democracy tonight. Thank you very much. I want to go back to my colleague, David Muir, in New York.",

         "Savannah Guthrie: (03:50)\nIt’s nothing but noise. What? Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, not withstanding a little, few technical difficulties, we’re thrilled to have you tonight. And we are very honored by the presence of our president, Donald Trump, who is going to walk in right now. We are about 30 seconds from air, so it’ll be just in time. Mr. President.\nSpeaker 1: (04:35)\nThis is an NBC news special presentation of Today with Savannah Guthrie.\nSavannah Guthrie: (04:40)\nTonight, Donald Trump in the arena. His first prime time network appearance since falling ill with Coronavirus.\nPresident Trump: (04:48)\nI’m feeling great, I don’t know about you. How is everyone feeling?\nSavannah Guthrie: (04:51)\nWith tonight’s debate canceled, the President faces our questions live and hears from voters about their concerns in the battleground state of Florida.\nPresident Trump: (05:00)\nIt’s great to be back in my home state, Florida, to make my official return to the campaign trail.\nSavannah Guthrie: (05:06)\nWith just 19 days to go, the President makes his case.\nPresident Trump: (05:10)\nMy goal is to fight for you and fight for your family.\nSpeaker 1: (05:16)\nFrom NBC News, Decision 2020, President Trump Town Hall. Live from the Perez Art Museum in Miami, here’s Savannah Guthrie.\nSavannah Guthrie: (05:28)\nHi everybody, and good evening. It’s good to have you with us, and welcome to Miami and our town hall with President Donald Trump. And we want to say right off the top, this is not how things were supposed to go tonight. This was supposed to be a town hall debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. But after the President contracted COVID, the debate commission announced it would have to be a virtual debate because of health concerns. The President then said he would not participate in a virtual debate. At that point, Joe Biden scheduled a town hall tonight in Pennsylvania on another network, and now the President is doing the same, his own town hall with the same venue format and time as NBC’s town hall with Joe Biden last week. So the two candidates go head to head tonight, though, not face to face, each in a key battleground state.\nSavannah Guthrie: (06:11)\nAnd tonight, the President will be taking questions from voters here in Miami, who we should mention are socially distanced and they’re wearing masks. And I should say, this audience looks a bit like America, it’s divided. Some here voted for the president in 2016 and plan to again, some support Joe Biden, and some say they are truly undecided. We’re going to get a mix of questions on a range of topics, and we’re going to get to those questions in a moment. But first with all of that ado, welcome, Mr. President, and thank you for being here.\nPresident Trump: (06:37)\nThat was very well stated, I have to say. Good job.\nSavannah Guthrie: (06:40)\nThank you. We’re glad you’re here, we’re glad you’re well. We send our best to the First Lady and to Barron.\nPresident Trump: (06:46)\nThank you, thank you.\nSavannah Guthrie: (06:46)\nDo you have any remaining symptoms from COVID?\nPresident Trump: (06:48)\nNothing whatsoever, I’m great, I feel good. I was in North Carolina today and did a big rally with tremendous turnout, and I just feel really good. Florida, Pennsylvania, were- They said, “Let’s go to the hospital.” I said, “That’s okay. I’m going to respond to what you say.” And we went over to Walter Reed, where you have tremendous professionals. They gave me Regeneron and Remdeceiver both. And all I know is I felt good the following day, I felt really good.\nSavannah Guthrie: (07:36)\nDid the doctors ever tell you that they saw pneumonia on your lung scans?\nPresident Trump: (07:39)\nNo, but they said the lungs are a little bit different, a little bit perhaps infected, and-\nSavannah Guthrie: (07:46)\nInfected with?\nPresident Trump: (07:48)\nI don’t know. I mean, I didn’t do too much asking. I really felt good. I didn’t have much of a problem with the lungs. I did have a little bit of a temperature. Obviously, I felt there was something missing, and then I tested, I tested positive.\nSavannah Guthrie: (08:01)\nWell, let’s talk about testing because there’s a little bit of a, I guess, confusion about this. And I think we can clear it up.\nPresident Trump: (08:06)\nYeah, and there shouldn’t be.\nSavannah Guthrie: (08:07)\nYour first positive test was Thursday, October 1st, okay? When was your last negative test? When did you last remember having a negative test?\nPresident Trump: (08:18)\nWell, I test quite a bit, and I can tell you that before the debate, which I thought it was a very good debate, and I felt fantastically, I had no problems before.\nSavannah Guthrie: (08:27)\nDid you test the day of the debate?\nPresident Trump: (08:29)\nI don’t know, I don’t even remember. I test all the time. But I can tell you this, after the debate, I guess a day or so, I think it was Thursday evening, maybe even late Thursday evening, I tested positive. That’s when I first found out about it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (08:44)\nWell back to the debate, because the debate commission’s rules, it was the honor system.\nPresident Trump: (08:48)\nYeah.\nSavannah Guthrie: (08:48)\nWould be that you would come with a negative test. You say you don’t know if you’ve got a test on the day of the debate?\nPresident Trump: (08:53)\nI had no problem. Again, the doctors do it. I don’t ask them. I test all the time. And they-\nSavannah Guthrie: (08:57)\nDid you take a test, though, on the day of the debate?\nPresident Trump: (09:00)\nIf you ask as the doctor, they’ll give you a perfect answer. But they take a test and I leave and I go about my business.\nSavannah Guthrie: (09:06)\nSo you did you take a test on the day of the debate, I guess is the bottom line?\nPresident Trump: (09:07)\nI probably did, and I took a test the day before and the day before, and I was always in great shape, and I was in great shape for the debate. And it was only after the debate, a period of time after the debate that I said, “That’s interesting.” And they took a test and it tested positive.\nSavannah Guthrie: (09:25)\nJust to button it up, do you take a test every single day?\nPresident Trump: (09:26)\nNo. No, but I take a lot of tests.\nSavannah Guthrie: (09:29)\nOkay. And you don’t know if you took a test the day of the debate?\nPresident Trump: (09:31)\nPossibly I did, possibly I didn’t. But the doctor has very accurate information and it’s not only that doctor, it’s many doctors. The one thing, if you’re President, you have a lot of doctors you’re surrounded by. But I was in great shape for the debate. And sometime after the debate, I tested positive, then that’s when they decided to, let’s go.\nSavannah Guthrie: (09:50)\nOkay, good. I hopefully provided some clarity for folks. Let’s talk about the event that was held at the White House on the Saturday before you tested positive. Subsequent to that, 13 people connected to that event tested positive. There was an outdoor reception, you’ve seen the pictures. There was an indoor reception. People were not wearing masks. My question to you is, at this point in the pandemic, knowing what we know, shouldn’t you have known better? Shouldn’t the White House know better than to hold an event like that?\nPresident Trump: (10:19)\nWell, they do a lot of testing in the White House, they test everybody including me, but they test everybody. And something happened. But as far as the mask is concerned, I’m good with masks. I’m okay with masks. I tell people, wear a mask. But just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it. So this is a very-\nSavannah Guthrie: (10:37)\nIt didn’t say that. I know that study.\nPresident Trump: (10:40)\nThat’s what I heard, and that’s what I saw. And regardless, but everybody’s tested and they’re tested often. And I also knew that, hey, I’m President. I have to see people. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be in a room. I can’t be… I have to be out.\nSavannah Guthrie: (10:56)\nYou can see people with a mask, though, right?\nPresident Trump: (10:58)\nI can, but people with masks are catching it all the time. I mean, if you look at the Governor of Virginia, he was known for a mask. If you look at Thom Tillis, a great guy, he always had a mask, and they caught it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (11:09)\nWell, there are pictures of Thom Tillis, actually with one of Judge Barrett’s kids not wearing a mask. But you know Chris Christie, he was part of your debate prep.\nPresident Trump: (11:16)\nYeah.\nSavannah Guthrie: (11:16)\nHe was, I believe at that event. He came out tonight, he was sick, very sick. He was in the hospital for about a week.\nPresident Trump: (11:22)\nYes, I know this.\nSavannah Guthrie: (11:22)\nHe came out tonight and said, “I was wrong not to wear a mask.”\nPresident Trump: (11:26)\nWell, I mean, he has to say that. I think it’s great, he’s a friend of mine. He’s a good guy. And wrong or not wrong, you have to understand, as President, I can’t be locked in a room someplace for the next year and just stay and do nothing. And every time I go into a crowd, I was with the parents of our fallen heroes. These people are the most incredible people. And they came up to me and they would hug me, and they would touch me, and I’m not to not let them do it, to be honest with you.\nSavannah Guthrie: (11:56)\nNow, there was an event with the gold star families the day after the Supreme Court event.\nPresident Trump: (11:59)\nThere was, exactly right. We had a gold star event with the most incredible people you’ve ever seen. And I could have chosen not to talk to them, or to keep everybody away. And you know what? I don’t think that’s probably where it was caught, but maybe it was.\nSavannah Guthrie: (12:11)\nI going to say, you bring it up, you brought it up yourself. I mean, are you trying to suggest that? Do you believe a grieving military family gave you a COVID?\nPresident Trump: (12:18)\nNo, I don’t know where it came from, and you don’t know where it came from, and the doctors don’t know where it came from. But as the President, I have to be out there. I also know-\nSavannah Guthrie: (12:26)\nWell, there’s no one that says you can’t be out there, but it’s just about wearing masks and having… For example, your rallies.\nPresident Trump: (12:30)\nI know this.\nSavannah Guthrie: (12:30)\nYour rallies don’t require masks.\nPresident Trump: (12:33)\nI mean, let’s see, Kamala. She’s got people now, people have it, and I’m not blaming her. I’m not saying, “Oh, she did a terrible thing.” As President, I have to be out there. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be locked in a very beautiful room someplace in the White House. And I want to see the gold star families, and I want to see everybody. And I also say to people all the time, it’s risky doing it. It is risky doing it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (12:55)\nBut as President, you’re right. You want to be a leader, but you also are a leader and a setter of an example. And if you’re not wearing a mask when your administration is saying, “Best practice right now is wear a mask,” no, it’s not foolproof. But that will-\nPresident Trump: (13:09)\nBut many people are catching it. Many people are getting this disease that was sent to us by China, and it shouldn’t have been allowed to happen. But many people are getting this. And I mean, nobody’s being blamed. Everybody is working hard to get this thing out of our country, get it out of the world. Look at what’s going on in Europe, massive spikes. They’ve done a very good job, but now you take a look today at the UK, you take a look at Spain and France and Italy. There’s tremendous spikes.\nSavannah Guthrie: (13:38)\nBut our death rate is worse than, well, not Spain, but those other countries.\nPresident Trump: (13:38)\nWell, I have thing right here that will tell you exactly the opposite.\nSavannah Guthrie: (13:41)\nMe too.\nPresident Trump: (13:41)\nThe UK is up 2500%, because I knew you’d be doing this. I know you very well. The UK is up 2500%. The EU is up 722%. And the United States is down 21%.\nSavannah Guthrie: (13:55)\nBut we have per… Our deaths per capita is among the highest of all-\nPresident Trump: (14:01)\nExcess mortality.\nSavannah Guthrie: (14:01)\nI’m sorry?\nPresident Trump: (14:01)\nExcess mortality, we’re a winner on the excess mortality. And what we’ve done has been amazing. And we have done an amazing job. And it’s rounding the corner and we have the vaccines coming, and we have the therapies coming. And I’ll tell you what, one thing. When I got it, I had a choice. Do nothing, or use some of the things that we’re looking at, like in this case, Regeneron. and Eli Lilly makes something that’s supposed to be incredible. And I think that maybe I wouldn’t be doing this discussion with you right now. We have therapies now and cures, maybe you can use the word cure, but we have therapies that are absolutely incredible, Savannah.\nSavannah Guthrie: (14:39)\nI want to pick up on something you just said. You said we’re rounding the corner.\nPresident Trump: (14:42)\nI believe we’re rounding the corner, yes.\nSavannah Guthrie: (14:43)\n10% of the country approximately has had COVID. That means 80%-90%, 90%, let’s do the math, is still vulnerable.\nPresident Trump: (14:51)\nRight, right. That’s right.\nSavannah Guthrie: (14:51)\nThere’s been some talk, including from the White House lately that perhaps it approves of what’s called herd immunity. That’s where you basically just let young people and everybody gets sick. You try to protect the old people and those who are sick. And hopefully, it gets up to a certain level, and now we’re all immune.\nPresident Trump: (15:08)\nYeah.\nSavannah Guthrie: (15:08)\nSo let’s just be clear about it. It also means more deaths. Do you support herd immunity as a strategy? Essentially, just let people get sick?\nPresident Trump: (15:18)\nThe cure can not be worse than the problem itself. We did the right thing. We were expected to lose 2,200,000 people, and maybe more than that. We’re at 210,000 people. One person is too much, it should have never happened because of China. It happened because of China. And you have to get that and understand that. But it shouldn’t have happened. But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,00 people.\nSavannah Guthrie: (15:49)\nThat 2 million figure, though, is if you literally did nothing.\nPresident Trump: (15:53)\nWe saved 2 million people.\nSavannah Guthrie: (15:53)\nThe 2 million figure is if you did absolutely nothing, it would be 2 million. The question is, should the deaths be better than 200,000, when-\nPresident Trump: (16:01)\nI don’t know, let me tell you what is happening. I left North Carolina, which I love. I left Pennsylvania. We won a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lockdown where nobody but her husband can do anything. He can go boating and do whatever he wants, but nobody else can. The fact is we’re winning all these cases because it’s unconstitutional what they’re doing. And I think they’re doing it for political reasons. But the fact is the cure, you can’t let this continue to go on with the lockdowns. And I believe that on November 4th, you’re going to have a lot of these governors.\nPresident Trump: (16:35)\nLook at what’s happening to New York. New York is a mess. They lost almost 40,000 people. They have a lockdown like you’ve never seen. Now they’re open, it’s like a ghost town. And Savannah, it’s very important. People are leaving New York by the thousands, and you’re going to have a hard time ever building it up again. So that cure, that so called cure that you talk about, it can’t be worse than the problem. The problem is a bad problem.\nSavannah Guthrie: (17:02)\nWe’ve got more questions.\nPresident Trump: (17:03)\n… than the problem. The problem is a bad problem.\nSavannah Guthrie: (17:03)\nWe’ve got more questions on COVID-\nPresident Trump: (17:03)\nOkay, fine.\nSavannah Guthrie: (17:04)\n… so let’s drop it, for now. We were supposed to, as mentioned, be watching you on a debate stage right now. We’re not doing that, so let’s clear up a few things from the last one. You were asked point blank to denounce white supremacy. In the moment, you didn’t. You asked some follow up questions. “Who, specifically?” A couple of days later, on a different show-\nPresident Trump: (17:24)\nOh, you always do this.\nSavannah Guthrie: (17:24)\n… you denounced white supremacy.\nPresident Trump: (17:26)\nNo, you always do this.\nSavannah Guthrie: (17:26)\nMy question to you is-\nPresident Trump: (17:27)\nYou’ve done this to me, and everybody-\nSavannah Guthrie: (17:27)\n… why does it seem like-\nPresident Trump: (17:29)\nI denounce white supremacy. Okay?\nSavannah Guthrie: (17:31)\nYou did, two days later.\nPresident Trump: (17:31)\nI’ve denounced white supremacy, for years, but you always do it. You always start off with the question. You didn’t ask Joe Biden, whether or not he denounces Antifa. I watched him on the same basic show with Lester Holt, and he was asking questions like Biden was a child.\nSavannah Guthrie: (17:48)\nWell, so this is a little bit of a dodge.\nPresident Trump: (17:48)\nSo, are you ready? Are you… Wait. Are you listening? I denounce white supremacy.\nSavannah Guthrie: (17:53)\nOkay.\nPresident Trump: (17:53)\nWhat’s your next question?\nSavannah Guthrie: (17:55)\nDo you feel, it feels sometimes you’re hesitant to do so, like you wait a beat.\nPresident Trump: (17:58)\nHesitant? Here we go again. Every time… In fact, my people came, “I’m sure they’ll ask you the white supremacy question.” I denounce white supremacy.\nSavannah Guthrie: (18:06)\nOkay.\nPresident Trump: (18:06)\nAnd frankly, you want to know something? I denounce Antifa, and I denounce these people on the left that are burning down our cities, that are run by Democrats who don’t know what they’re doing-\nSavannah Guthrie: (18:15)\nAll right, while we’re denouncing, let me ask you about QAnon. It is this theory that Democrats are a satanic pedophile ring and that you are the savior, of that. Now can you just, once and for all, state that that is completely not true, and-\nPresident Trump: (18:34)\nSo, I know [crosstalk 00:18:35]-\nSavannah Guthrie: (18:34)\n… disavow QAnon-\nPresident Trump: (18:34)\nYeah.\nSavannah Guthrie: (18:36)\n… in its entirety?\nPresident Trump: (18:37)\nI know nothing about QAnon.\nSavannah Guthrie: (18:39)\nI just told you.\nPresident Trump: (18:41)\nI know very little. You told me, but what you tell me, doesn’t necessarily make it fact. I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard. But I know nothing about it. If you’d like me to-\nSavannah Guthrie: (18:54)\nThey believe that it is a Satanic cult run by the deep state.\nPresident Trump: (18:57)\n… study the subject. I’ll tell you what I do know about. I know about Antifa, and I know about the radical left, and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are. And I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats, not run by Republicans.\nSavannah Guthrie: (19:09)\nRepublican Senator Ben Sasse said, quote, “QAnon is nuts and real leaders call conspiracy theories, conspiracy theories.”\nPresident Trump: (19:20)\nHe may be right.\nSavannah Guthrie: (19:20)\nWhy not just say, it’s crazy and not true?\nPresident Trump: (19:20)\nCan I be honest? He may be right. I just don’t know about QAnon.\nSavannah Guthrie: (19:22)\nYou do know.\nPresident Trump: (19:23)\nI don’t know. No, I don’t know. I don’t know. You tell me all about it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (19:28)\nLet me ask you another thing.\nPresident Trump: (19:28)\nLet’s waste the whole show. You start off with white supremacy. I denounce it. You start off with something else. Let’s go. Keep asking me these questions. But let me just-\nSavannah Guthrie: (19:37)\nOkay, I do have one more in this vein.\nPresident Trump: (19:39)\n… let me just tell you. What I do hear about it, is they are very strongly against pedophilia. And I agree with that. I mean, I do agree with that-\nSavannah Guthrie: (19:45)\nOkay.\nPresident Trump: (19:45)\n… and I agree with it very strongly.\nSavannah Guthrie: (19:45)\nBut there’s not a Satanic pedophile cult being run by-\nPresident Trump: (19:49)\nI have no idea. I know nothing about them.\nSavannah Guthrie: (19:52)\nYou don’t know that? Okay.\nPresident Trump: (19:52)\nNo, I don’t know that.\nSavannah Guthrie: (19:52)\nYou, just this week-\nPresident Trump: (19:55)\nAnd neither do you, know that.\nSavannah Guthrie: (19:55)\nOkay. Just this week, you retweeted-\nPresident Trump: (19:58)\nWhy aren’t you asking me about Antifa? Why aren’t you asking me about the radical left?\nSavannah Guthrie: (20:00)\nBecause you just, because you’re volunteering it.\nPresident Trump: (20:02)\nWhy aren’t you asking Joe Biden questions about, why doesn’t he condemn Antifa? Why does he say it doesn’t exist?\nSavannah Guthrie: (20:08)\nBecause you’re here, before me.\nPresident Trump: (20:09)\nAntifa, no, excuse me. That’s so cute. Antifa exists. They’re vicious, they’re violent. They kill people, and they’re burning down our cities. And they happen to be radical left.\nSavannah Guthrie: (20:20)\nJust this week, you retweeted to your 87 million followers, a conspiracy theory that Joe Biden orchestrated to have SEAL Team Six, the Navy SEAL Team Six, killed to cover up the fake death of Bin Laden. Now, why would you send a lie like that to your followers?\nPresident Trump: (20:35)\nI know nothing about it, can I [crosstalk 00:20:36]-\nSavannah Guthrie: (20:35)\nYou retweeted it.\nPresident Trump: (20:38)\nThat was a retweet. That was an opinion of somebody-\nSavannah Guthrie: (20:40)\nBut-\nPresident Trump: (20:41)\n…. and that was a retweet. I’ll put it out there. People can decide for themselves. I don’t take a position.\nSavannah Guthrie: (20:46)\nI don’t get that, you’re the President. You’re not like, someone’s crazy uncle who can just-\nPresident Trump: (20:47)\nNo, no. No, no.\nSavannah Guthrie: (20:47)\n… retweet, whatever.\nPresident Trump: (20:47)\nThat was a retweet. And I do a lot of retweets. And frankly, because the media is so fake, and so corrupt, if I didn’t have social media… I don’t call it Twitter, I call it social media. I wouldn’t be able to get the word out. And the word is-\nSavannah Guthrie: (21:03)\nWell, the word is false.\nPresident Trump: (21:04)\n… and you know what the word is? The word is very simple. We’re building our country, stronger and better than it’s ever been before.\nSavannah Guthrie: (21:10)\nLet’s stop-\nPresident Trump: (21:11)\nAnd that’s what’s happening. And everybody knows it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (21:12)\nOkay, we’ve got a bunch of questions for you.\nPresident Trump: (21:14)\nYou know what else the word is? We’re winning in a lot of states.\nSavannah Guthrie: (21:15)\nOkay.\nPresident Trump: (21:16)\nWe’re winning in a lot of States. You’re going to see that.\nSavannah Guthrie: (21:17)\nWell, let me ask… Okay. I’m glad you brought up the election, because I do want to ask about that. That’s another kind of leftover item. A lot of people have asked you, will you accept a peaceful transfer of power? You have said, repeatedly, “The only way we lose this election is, if it is rigged.” Now, that is simply not true. The fact is, either candidate can lose fair and square, without ballot fraud.\nPresident Trump: (21:38)\nSure, they can. And do you know what?\nSavannah Guthrie: (21:39)\nSo, will you accept the results of the election?\nPresident Trump: (21:40)\nWin or lose, that’s the way I want it to be. But when I see thousands of ballots, right? Unsolicited ballots, being given out by the millions, and thousands of them are dumped in dumpsters. And when you see ballots with the name Trump, military ballots, from our great military. And they’re dumped in garbage cans-\nSavannah Guthrie: (21:59)\nThat is a handful… We could go all night, which we won’t.\nPresident Trump: (22:01)\nNo, no, it’s happening every day.\nSavannah Guthrie: (22:03)\nBut, we could go all night, one by one. A single case, a single day. You’re talking about 150 million votes. Your own FBI director says, there is no evidence of widespread fraud.\nPresident Trump: (22:11)\nOh, really? Well, then he’s not doing a very good job. All you have to do is pick up the papers every day. 50,000 in Ohio, the great state of Ohio. 50,000 in another location, I think North Carolina. 500,000 applications in Virginia. No, no, there’s a tremendous problem.\nPresident Trump: (22:29)\nBut let me just tell you, they talk about the peaceful transfer, right? They spied on my campaign and they got caught. And they spied heavily, on my campaign. And they tried to take down a duly elected sitting president. And then, they talk about, “Will you accept a peaceful transfer?” And the answer is, yes, I will. But I want it to be an honest election. And so does everybody else. When I see thousands of ballots dumped in a garbage can, and they happen to have my name on it? I’m not happy about that.\nSavannah Guthrie: (22:57)\nOkay, but just… Those are case, there is no, there is in fact, no evidence of widespread fraud. And you are sowing doubt about our democracy.\nPresident Trump: (23:05)\nCould I ask you, how can you say that?\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:07)\nOur democracy.\nPresident Trump: (23:07)\nHow can you say that? You do read newspapers?\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:08)\nI do.\nPresident Trump: (23:08)\nYou do watch the news?\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:09)\nYes, I do.\nPresident Trump: (23:09)\nI know you read the news, but do you watch it?\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:11)\nI do.\nPresident Trump: (23:12)\nBecause, every day, they’re talking about ballots that are corrupt, that are fraudulent.\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:17)\nAnd millions that are-\nPresident Trump: (23:18)\nSure.\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:19)\n… being processed right now.\nPresident Trump: (23:21)\nSure, sure. But you can win a race… Take a look at me. You can win a race by 1%.\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:24)\nSo why are you laying the groundwork for that, right now?\nPresident Trump: (23:27)\nI’m not, I don’t want that to happen.\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:29)\nIt’s like, if I go play tennis with my husband and I say, ” My ankle is hurting right now.”\nPresident Trump: (23:31)\nYou know what? I don’t want that to happen. Savannah. I want it to be clean.\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:35)\nOkay.\nPresident Trump: (23:35)\nAnd I want… I really feel we’re going to win, but I want this to be clean.\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:39)\nLet’s get to questions.\nPresident Trump: (23:39)\nBut it’s sort of ironic that you, and them, talk about the peaceful transfer when I spent three and a half years fighting off these maniacs. And now, it turns out, everything’s there. That they were the ones that dealt with Russia, and it’s too bad.\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:54)\nOkay.\nPresident Trump: (23:55)\nPeaceful transfer, I absolutely want that. But ideally, I don’t want to transfer, because I want to win.\nSavannah Guthrie: (23:59)\nYes. And I think that, your words will probably reassure some folks. Let’s get to our first voter. We’ve got Jacqueline Lugo. Now she is, I told you, this audience is truly split between y’all. You are leaning Biden, she voted for Clinton in 2016. She’s registered as an Independent. Jacqueline, what’s your question for the President? And hold the mic up close, and take off your mic, because it’s hard to hear, out here.\nPresident Trump: (24:19)\nSure.\nJacqueline Lugo: (24:19)\nGood evening.\nPresident Trump: (24:25)\nHow are you?\nJacqueline Lugo: (24:25)\nWelcome to Miami.\nPresident Trump: (24:25)\nThank you very much, it’s beautiful.\nJacqueline Lugo: (24:25)\nMr. President, if you knew COVID-19, as you told Bob Woodward in February-\nPresident Trump: (24:32)\nAs what?\nJacqueline Lugo: (24:33)\nAs you told Bob Woodward in February, was airborne and deadlier than the flu, why did you only put in place a travel ban from China, and not put in place other measures mitigating the spread of COVID-19, potentially saving tens of thousands of American lives?\nPresident Trump: (24:56)\nWell, I did put it in very early, as you know, Joe Biden was two months behind me, and he called me xenophobic and racist and everything else, because I put it in. And it turned out that I was 100% right. I also put it on Europe, very early, because I saw there was a lot of infection in Europe. And it’s sort of an amazing question. And I appreciate the question, and respect the question, but the news doesn’t get out the right answer.\nPresident Trump: (25:18)\nBecause I put on a travel ban far earlier than Dr. Fauci thought it was necessary. Who I like. Far earlier than the scientists… I was actually the only one that wanted to put it on. And I did it, actually against the advice of a lot of people, including Nancy Pelosi who had no clue what she was doing. And, Biden.\nPresident Trump: (25:37)\nWhen I put on the travel ban… You know, I put it on in January. The end of January. When I put on the travel ban Joe Biden, and others, said, “This is ridiculous. You don’t do that.” Well, Dr. Fauci said, I saved thousands and thousands of lives.\nSavannah Guthrie: (25:52)\nDid you [crosstalk 00:25:52]-\nPresident Trump: (25:52)\nI was early, I was extremely early, when I put on the travel ban.\nSavannah Guthrie: (25:56)\nCan I ask you, did your National Security Advisor, on January 28th in the Oval Office, warn you that this would be the greatest national security risk of your administration?\nPresident Trump: (26:03)\nI read that, but no, he didn’t.\nSavannah Guthrie: (26:05)\nHe didn’t say it, or you don’t remember?\nPresident Trump: (26:06)\nI read it… I read it, someplace. Maybe Woodward said it, or something. But no, he did not say that. But, I knew it was a big threat. At the same time, I don’t want to panic this country. I don’t want to go out and say, “Everybody’s going to die. Everybody’s going to-”\nSavannah Guthrie: (26:20)\nIsn’t there a middle ground?\nPresident Trump: (26:21)\nOkay?\nSavannah Guthrie: (26:21)\nYou don’t have to mislead-\nPresident Trump: (26:23)\nNo, there’s not a middle ground.\nSavannah Guthrie: (26:24)\n… but you can-\nPresident Trump: (26:25)\nNo, no. No. There’s not a middle ground. You have to be safe. You have to be vigilant, and you have to be smart.\nSavannah Guthrie: (26:27)\nYou’re going to like this next couple of voters.\nPresident Trump: (26:29)\nOkay. Good.\nSavannah Guthrie: (26:29)\nIt’s a mom and a daughter. Mom, Barbara voted for you in 2016. She’s leaning to vote for you again. Now, her daughter was too young to vote last time, she’s going to vote for her first time in a presidential campaign. And she is leaning, Biden. So imagine the dinner table at their house. Okay?\nPresident Trump: (26:44)\nWe’ll talk you out of it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (26:44)\nSo Barbara, why don’t you go first, and ask your question.\nPresident Trump: (26:48)\n[Spanish, foreign language 00:26:48] Miami.\nSavannah Guthrie: (26:49)\nThank you.\nBarbara Peña: (26:49)\nMr. Trump, as a frontline ER doctor, working through the coronavirus pandemic-\nPresident Trump: (26:53)\nRight.\nBarbara Peña: (26:54)\n… I know firsthand, and I’ve seen that many hospitals throughout the United States, are suffering financial hardships. These economic effects are trickling down to the frontline workers.\nPresident Trump: (27:05)\nRight.\nBarbara Peña: (27:06)\nWe are being… Across the country, frontline workers are being fired, they’re being furloughed. Our salaries are being cut, and this is also happening another economic sectors as well, including the travel industry and hospitality.\nPresident Trump: (27:17)\nRight.\nBarbara Peña: (27:17)\nMy question to you is, how are you going to get the United States back on track, both in terms of the economy and the pandemic?\nPresident Trump: (27:25)\nSo, it’s happening. We just set a record, 11.4 million jobs. We are going to have a phenomenal third quarter, which will be announced on November 1st, just prior to the big November 3rd day, where I think you’re going to see a red wave. But we’re going to have a tremendous announcement. I believe. I mean, we’re going to find out, but GDP is going through the roof. Jobs, real estate, houses. So many things are happening.\nPresident Trump: (27:49)\nSo, people were saying, we’re going to have a 42% unemployment. Look, this was a thing that came into our country and it happened a hundred, more than a hundred years ago, and it happened now. They were talking about a 42% unemployment rate.\nSavannah Guthrie: (28:04)\nWho was talking about that?\nPresident Trump: (28:05)\nIt came out, it just came out-\nSavannah Guthrie: (28:05)\nI heard, 20%.\nPresident Trump: (28:09)\n… at 7.8% unemployment, and people can’t even believe it. Our economy is going to be… Next year, if we don’t have somebody that raises taxes and quadruples taxes, which they want to do, and it kills everything. Our economy is going to be phenomenal, next year. We’re going to have a phenomenal…\nPresident Trump: (28:24)\nAnd, I’ll tell you, Savannah. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country last year, including the state of Florida, where we are now. In Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in Ohio, every place. We had the greatest economy we ever had. We had to close it down, we saved two million lives. We’re opening it up. We have a V-shape and it’s coming back. It’s coming back very fast.\nPresident Trump: (28:45)\nOne other thing, we really helped the hospitals. We’ve sent billions and billions of dollars to the hospitals. In addition, hundreds of millions of masks and gowns. And we went into the ventilator business, because this country was not equipped with ventilators. And I’m not blaming anybody for it. But we’re now making thousands of ventilators a month, and we have all we can use. We’re sending them all over the world, because the world needs them. So, they’ve worked very hard and really very, very effectively. Thank you. Great question.\nSavannah Guthrie: (29:15)\nLet’s talk to Isabella, and put the mic close to your mouth. Okay, go ahead.\nIsabella Peña: (29:19)\nMr. President, my parents are, as you heard, both frontline healthcare workers. And I’ve seen the physical and the mental toll that this pandemic has taken on them, firsthand. As well as the exacerbation of coronavirus, due to Americans who are not wearing masks or participating in social distancing. After contracting COVID-19 yourself, has your opinion changed on the importance of mask wearing?\nPresident Trump: (29:41)\nNo, because I was okay with the masks. I was good with it, but I’ve heard many different stories on masks. I had, being president, you have people, they bring meals, they bring this, they… And I had an instance recently, where a very wonderful person is bringing me a meal, and he’s playing with his mask. And he’s touching his mask, all over the place.\nPresident Trump: (29:59)\nAnd then he’s bringing a plate in, and I’m saying, “Well, I don’t know if that’s so good.” I mean, the good news, I didn’t eat it. Okay? I decided not to eat it. This was a month ago. But I… Look, look, you have, on the masks, you have two stories. You have a story where they want, a story where they don’t want. I am all for it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (30:15)\nWho is, I don’t get that, because it’s just… All of your public health officials, your administration, they’re in unison about this.\nPresident Trump: (30:21)\nSome. No.\nSavannah Guthrie: (30:22)\nThey’re all in unison about it.\nPresident Trump: (30:23)\nNo, the [crosstalk 00:30:25].\nSavannah Guthrie: (30:24)\nThe University of Washington, which is, they have a model that your coronavirus task force relies on. Says that, if everyone wore a mask, you could cut expected deaths in half.\nPresident Trump: (30:35)\nAnd then, you have other people that disagree.\nSavannah Guthrie: (30:35)\n60,000 lives. Well, what does that mean?\nPresident Trump: (30:39)\nScott Atkins, if you look at Scott, Dr. Scott. He’s from, great guy, Stanford. He will tell you that, he disagrees with you.\nSavannah Guthrie: (30:44)\nHe’s not an infectious disease expert.\nPresident Trump: (30:45)\nOh, I don’t know. Look, he’s an expert. He’s one of the great experts of the world.\nSavannah Guthrie: (30:49)\nBut I don’t get it, because you have so much power and influence as president.\nPresident Trump: (30:51)\nI’m all for it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (30:51)\nAnd you could go to your… You could require it-\nPresident Trump: (30:53)\nBy the way-\nSavannah Guthrie: (30:53)\n… at your rallies, and you could say-\nPresident Trump: (30:54)\nI never said, “Don’t wear them.”\nSavannah Guthrie: (30:55)\n“Everyone put on a mask right now.” And the University of Washington says, you would save lives.\nPresident Trump: (30:57)\nSavannah, University of Washington. And then, you have other places, say different things. You have a lot of… Hey. Dr. Fauci said, “Don’t wear a mask,” right?\nSavannah Guthrie: (31:04)\nAt first, but then everybody agreed.\nPresident Trump: (31:07)\nOh, I don’t know. Then he changed his mind. But then, you have a report coming out two days ago, that 85% of the people wearing masks catch it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (31:13)\nI looked at that report, it’s not about mask wearing. It was neutral on the question of masks.\nPresident Trump: (31:17)\nSavannah. We’re on the same side. I say, wear the mask. I’m fine with it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (31:20)\nOkay. Okay.\nPresident Trump: (31:20)\nI have no problem. We’re on the same side.\nSavannah Guthrie: (31:22)\nLet’s take a break. We’re going to get more questions, right after this.\nPresident Trump: (31:24)\nThank you.\nPresident Trump: (31:24)\n(silence).\nSavannah: (34:44)\nAnd we’re back. We’re live in Miami with President Trump for a town hall. Live in Miami with President Trump for a town hall. Thank you again, Mr. President. We have another voter. Now, Christie Alonzo, come on out, Christie, she is leaning slightly towards you, she says. She voted for you in 2016. Christie, you ready? Take the mask off, hold the mic close, and let’s hear your question.\nCristy Montesinos Alonso: (35:04)\nThank you for your service, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump: (35:06)\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nCristy Montesinos Alonso: (35:07)\nWe’re a hard-working middle-class family of four. My husband and I are both self-employed, and we have to get our own individual healthcare. As you know, healthcare costs have gone up considerably over the decades. And you had originally said you were going to repeal and replace Obamacare. What is your plan now in 2020 to make healthcare costs affordable for Americans like myself?\nPresident Trump: (35:29)\nGood. So we got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obamacare, and now you could actually say it’s not Obamacare because that’s how big it was, where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, so we got rid of that. That was a big, big thing. And by doing that, and we will always have… By the way, we’re always protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and I can’t say that more strongly, but we’ve been able to bring healthcare costs way down. Now, I took over Obamacare, got rid of the individual mandate, made it good, managed it much better. Remember, they had the $5 billion website disaster, and all of the problems they had. The problem with Obamacare, it’s not good. We’d like to terminate it, and we want a much less expensive healthcare that’s a much better healthcare, and that’s where we’re aiming. And if we can do that, and we have a very good chance of doing it, but we’ve also brought down the price of Obamacare. The problem with Obamacare, it basically is never going to be great, and I want to give great healthcare. So important. And thank you very much.\nSavannah: (36:37)\nMr. President, I got a follow-up pre-existing conditions. This is such a big issue for voters.\nPresident Trump: (36:39)\nIt is a big issue for me too.\nSavannah: (36:41)\nIn point of fact, your administration is about to go to the Supreme Court to argue to throw out the rest of Obamacare, which includes the protections for preexisting conditions.\nPresident Trump: (36:50)\nThat’s right. That’s right.\nSavannah: (36:50)\nSo your administration is in court right now, trying to get rid of that protection.\nPresident Trump: (36:54)\nIn order to replace it with a much better healthcare at a much lower price. And always, under all circumstances, we are going to protect the Republicans. And maybe I changed the party a lot over the last three years, but we will protect people with preexisting conditions. And Savannah, what I want to do, get rid of the terrible Obamacare. I’ve already done it to a large extent because as you know, the individual mandate is gone. That was the worst part.\nSavannah: (37:22)\nYou repealed, but you haven’t replaced.\nPresident Trump: (37:23)\nNo, no.\nSavannah: (37:23)\nNow, you’ve been in office almost four years.\nPresident Trump: (37:26)\nWe have done-\nSavannah: (37:27)\nYou have both houses of Congress, Senate and House, in Republican hands, and there is not a replacement yet.\nPresident Trump: (37:33)\nThat’s right. I’m sorry, but if you look, we had both houses and what did we do? We got rid of the individual mandate. That went through the legislature.\nSavannah: (37:39)\nBut the promise was repeal and replace.\nPresident Trump: (37:40)\nLook, look. We should be on the same side. I wanted very simple. I’m going to put it very simple. We would like to terminate it, and we would like to replace it with something that’s much less expensive and much better. We will always protect people with preexisting conditions.\nSavannah: (37:59)\nBut if you’re successful in court-\nPresident Trump: (37:59)\nAnd here’s the thing-\nSavannah: (37:59)\n… in November, those preexisting conditions, that promise will be gone.\nPresident Trump: (38:00)\nIf we don’t succeed, we are running the remnants of whatever’s left because we took it apart. We are running the remnants of whatever’s left much better than the previous administration, which ran it very badly, but we’d like to have new healthcare much better and much less expensive.\nSavannah: (38:16)\nLet me get to question number five. And you’ll like this, he’s stuck in traffic. His name is Joe White. He is registered as a Democrat. He says he’s leaning toward Biden and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. And his question was a, a second stimulus payment has been broadly agreed upon by the Republicans and Democrats, and yet, now we’re in October and it’s still not passed. Why not use your office to make the second stimulus payment a separate targeted emergency relief package to help Americans weather the pandemic?\nPresident Trump: (38:43)\nWell, we’ve actually passed three packages, and we’re on our fourth, and I agree with him 100%. He should vote for me. The problem you have is Nancy Pelosi. She couldn’t care less about the worker. She couldn’t care less about our people. And we should have a stimulus, and I want a stimulus. The Republicans will approve a stimulus. The problem is she doesn’t want to do it because she thinks it’s bad for her election. The fact is, she’s wrong because people know she’s in our way, she’s not approving it, she doesn’t appreciate our people, and she doesn’t appreciate, at all, our workers. Nancy Pelosi, we are ready to sign and pass stimulus, but she’s got to approve it.\nSavannah: (39:21)\nPeople do not love the back and forth of Washington, but this has been a rollercoaster. Back in early October, you one day tweeted, “No more negotiations until after election day. I’m walking away.” Then, I think the next couple of days you said, “Maybe we can do something targeted.”\nPresident Trump: (39:38)\nThat’s right.\nSavannah: (39:38)\nThen you said, “I want a big, big bill.” But then Senate Republicans said, “No, we’re not for that.” So you are the big deal-maker. How come this is so… You yourself had changed positions.\nPresident Trump: (39:59)\nThat’s right. Did you ever hear a word called negotiation when negotiating? Okay. I’m negotiating-\nSavannah: (39:59)\nBut people’s lives are hanging in the balance.\nPresident Trump: (39:59)\nYou know what? And you know who I’m negotiating against? Nancy Pelosi, because she doesn’t want to give them money. We should have stimulus. This was not our people’s fault. This was China’s fault. And she’s penalizing our people. I’m ready to sign a big, beautiful stimulus. You saw the other day, I said, “Go big or go home.” Right?\nSavannah: (40:15)\nThat’s what I was talking about.\nPresident Trump: (40:15)\nI want it to be big. I want it to be bold. I want the money to go to directly to the people.\nSavannah: (40:19)\nSenate Republicans with you, they’re going to go big?\nPresident Trump: (40:22)\nThey’ll go. Yeah, they’ll go. They’ll go. They’re going be very active-\nSavannah: (40:24)\nOkay, because so far, they have not said they would.\nPresident Trump: (40:24)\nI know, because I haven’t asked them to because I can’t get through Nancy Pelosi.\nSavannah: (40:27)\nOkay.\nPresident Trump: (40:28)\nIf Nancy Pelosi and I, through my representatives or directly, I don’t care, if we agree to something, the Republicans will agree to it.\nSavannah: (40:36)\nOkay. Our next question comes from… Oh, this is interesting. She voted for Clinton in 2016, but recently changed her registration from Democrat to Independent. She says she’s truly undecided. Her name’s Becky Lightman. Hello, Becky. What’s your question?\nPresident Trump: (40:52)\nHow are you?\nBarbara Peña: (40:53)\nHi, I’m great. How are you?\nPresident Trump: (40:53)\nNice to see you. Thank you.\nBarbara Peña: (40:54)\nGood to see you. So corporate tax rates are a hot button issue and you have cut corporate tax rates. And your opponent, Joe Biden, is planning to raise them. A lot of Americans think that corporations don’t pay their share of taxes and want to see those tax rates increase. What do you say to those Americans to maybe tell them why you want the corporate tax rate lower and why that helps them?\nPresident Trump: (41:20)\nIt’s a great question. We’ve created more jobs than this country has ever created. We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never even close to that number. We were just hitting 160 million jobs, companies are pouring into our nation because of the tax rate, and if Biden comes in and raises taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes, which he wants to do, you will blow this thing, and you’ll end up with a depression, the likes of which you’ve never had. That’s what’s going to happen. We have something that’s really good. The reason we’re coming back so strong is because we built a very strong foundation. Companies are moving in. Car companies are moving into Michigan, into Ohio, into South Carolina, and North Carolina just today, so what’s happening is, they’re coming in because we reduced the taxes. Our taxes, our corporate taxes were the highest in the world, and now they’re among the lower taxes. They’re not the lowest, but they’re among the lowest. And what that means, is jobs, but also we’re doing a very big, and we’ve done a very big, middle income tax package. So if we get in, we’re going to do the middle income tax package, but it’s a great question. And if he comes along and raises rates, all those companies that are coming in, they will leave the U.S. so fast your head will spin. We can’t let that happen. Thank you.\nSavannah: (42:33)\nOn the subject of taxes, as you know, the New York times has obtained, it says years of your tax returns among other things, it says that you have debts of approximately $421 million that you have personally guaranteed, and that will come due in the next four years. The question is, on behalf of voters, who do you owe $421 million to?\nPresident Trump: (42:53)\nOkay, first of all, let me answer. What they did is illegal, number one. Also, the numbers are all wrong, with the numbers they released. And just so you understand, when you have a lot of real estate, I have real estate, you know a lot of it. Okay? Right down the road, Doral, big stuff, great stuff. When I decided to run, I’m very underlevered, fortunately, but I’m very underlevered. I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared. In fact, some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money. $400 million compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world, and frankly, The Bank of America building in San Francisco. I don’t love what’s happening to San Francisco. 1290 Avenue of the Americas, one of the biggest office buildings.\nSavannah: (43:37)\nWell do I hear you right? It sounds like you’re saying $400 million isn’t that much. But are you confirming that, yes, you do owe some $400 million?\nPresident Trump: (43:47)\nWhat I’m saying is that, it’s a tiny percentage of my net worth.\nSavannah: (43:50)\nThat sounds like yes.\nPresident Trump: (43:51)\nAnd you’ll see that soon because we’re doing things. We’ve given, I think it’s 108 or 112 pages of financial detail to elections, and we have to file as the president, as any politician, you have to file. Nobody ever looks at that. When they do, they see how incredible a company is, but more importantly, they see where this debt is. No, I don’t owe Russia money. I owe a very, very small… It’s called mortgages. People have a house, they put a mortgage.\nSavannah: (44:20)\nAny foreign bank? Any foreign entity?\nPresident Trump: (44:21)\nNot that I know of, but I will probably, because it’s so easy to solve, and if you’d like to do, I will let you know who I owe, whatever small amount of money. I want to say two things. Number one, it’s a very small amount of money. Number two, it’s very straight. It’s very, very straight, but it’s a tiny percentage of the worth. Did you ever hear the expression underlevered?\nSavannah: (44:43)\nYeah.\nPresident Trump: (44:44)\nI am extremely underlevered.\nSavannah: (44:46)\nWell, here’s the thing. You could clear this up tonight by just releasing your tax returns yourself. That’s what I don’t understand. I think people are just wondering, you’re the only-\nPresident Trump: (44:53)\nAs you know, I’m under audit. It turned out that I am under audit.\nSavannah: (44:55)\nYes, but the IRS said… You are.\nPresident Trump: (44:55)\nBut they actually… Excuse me. No, no.\nSavannah: (44:58)\nBut the IRS says that doesn’t stop you from releasing.\nPresident Trump: (44:59)\nBut you accused me of not being under audit previously.\nSavannah: (45:02)\nI did not.\nPresident Trump: (45:02)\nAnd so did other people at NBC. And I am under audit.\nSavannah: (45:05)\nYou are.\nPresident Trump: (45:06)\nSo that one’s solved. That’s good. I am under audit. No person in their right mind would release, prior to working out the deal with the IRS. And I’ll go a step further. I’m treated very badly by the IRS. They treat me very, very badly. You have people in there from previous administrations that treat me very badly, but we’re under audit. It’s very routine, in many ways, but we’re under audit. They like to change the game, change the rules, do everything. You saw what they did with the tea party people. You saw what they did with the religious group.\nSavannah: (45:36)\nBut to be clear, there is no law or rule that prohibits you from releasing your tax returns.\nPresident Trump: (45:40)\nNo, except common sense, and intelligence, and having lawyers that say… Because I would love to release them, and as soon as we come to a conclusion, I will release them, and very gladly, but if you go to elections, and if you take a look, you’ll see 112, I think it’s 112, it talks about the income, which is rather massive. It talks about all of the properties. They have them listed. You can never learn more, but you know what happened? People went there. All the reporters went. There was a feeding frenzy. This was originally, when I filed it. And I filed it every year. I update it every year. My son is here. They run the company. I don’t run the company.\nSavannah: (46:17)\nIt also says that you’ve paid $750 in taxes in the year you were elected. Is that true or not?\nPresident Trump: (46:21)\nYeah, because that’s a statutory number. It’s a statutory.\nSavannah: (46:24)\nBut is that true?\nPresident Trump: (46:25)\nI think it’s a filing number. You pay 750, it’s a filing or a filing fee.\nSavannah: (46:29)\nBut is that all you paid? Because most people here probably paid more.\nPresident Trump: (46:31)\nNo, I don’t know. I can tell you this. If they have my tax returns, as you know, they have to go to jail. It’s illegal, but their numbers were wrong, but let me tell you what else. I don’t owe money to any of these sinister people. This has been going on for years now. Russia, Russia, Russia. It turned out to be a hoax, and it turned out to be that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were dealing with Russia, not me. It’s a whole hoax. So I would not mind at all saying who it is, but it’s a very small… When you look at vast properties like I have, and they’re big, and they’re beautiful, and they’re well located. When you look at that, the amount of money, $400 million is a peanut. It’s extremely underlevered. And it’s levered with normal banks. Not a big deal.\nSavannah: (47:17)\nAll right, let’s take a break. We’ll get more voter questions right after this.\nPresident Trump: (47:20)\nThank you. Thank you.\nSavannah: (51:00)\nWe are live in Miami, in the middle of a town hall with President Trump. Thank you again-\nSavannah Guthrie: (51:03)\nWe are live in Miami in the middle of a town hall with President Trump. Thank you again for being here.\nPresident Trump: (51:04)\nThank you.\nSavannah Guthrie: (51:04)\nWe’ve got another voter, Adam Schucher. He voted for Clinton in 2016. He’s registered as a Democrat and says he’s supporting Biden. Adam, take it away.\nAdam Schucher: (51:14)\nThank you, Savannah. Thank you, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump: (51:15)\nThank you, Adam.\nAdam Schucher: (51:16)\nFour years ago, Senate leadership said it was inappropriate to push through a nominee in an election year, yet they fast-tracked your nominee for the Supreme Court just today. The question I have for you is, what do you say to the voter that thinks it’s hypocritical to act in that manner and that they can’t trust Republicans’ word?\nPresident Trump: (51:37)\nSo when I was elected, and when a president is elected, they’re elected for a period of four years. And Justice Ginsburg said it best. I think, talking about president Obama having to do with somebody else, that the president is put there for four years, not for three years. So during this fourth year, it happened to come up, unfortunately, because I had great respect for Justice Ginsburg. But a vacancy happened to come up, and we picked somebody that’s outstanding. She has been an absolute star, and I’m extremely proud of it. But again, plenty of time.\nPresident Trump: (52:10)\nThere’s plenty of time. We’re going to do it before the election, but we also have much time after the election. But there’s no reason to wait, because it’s almost unanimous, it seems to me, certainly within the Republican party. And frankly, most of the Democrats within closed rooms, I guarantee you that. This is an outstanding person, and I’m using my fourth term. And if you look at it and if you put the shoe on the other foot, if they had this, they would do it 100%. So there’s been 29 times when this has happened. All 29 times a president has done exactly what I’ve done.\nSavannah Guthrie: (52:43)\nTo the voter’s point, I’ll just say that in 2016, you were on another show, actually another morning show, and you were asked whether President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court Justice Merrick Garland. And you said, “I think the Senate should wait until the next president, and let the president pick.” Now that was eight months before the election. This is three weeks before the election.\nPresident Trump: (53:04)\nSo I have a lot of respect, by the way, for-\nSavannah Guthrie: (53:06)\nSo you have changed your position on this?\nPresident Trump: (53:07)\nI have a lot of respect for Judge Garland. I want to tell you that. But I’ll tell you, the whole ball game changed when I saw the way they treated Justice Kavanaugh. I have never seen any human being, and I’m not just talking about Supreme Court… I have never seen a human being treated so badly with false accusations and everything else. I have never seen anything like it. And you know what the truth is, Savannah? Like it or not, the ball game changed a lot. There has never been anybody treated so badly as, now Justice Kavanaugh.\nSavannah Guthrie: (53:38)\nYou’ve mentioned that you would like to see Amy Coney Barrett confirmed to the Supreme Court in case any challenges come up in connection with the election. Do you expect her to rule for you?\nPresident Trump: (53:49)\nWell, I think she’ll have to make that decision. I don’t think she has any conflict at all. A Supreme Court judge does not have… They can make their own decision. They actually have additional power to make that decision. It would be totally up to her. I would think that she would be able to rule either for me or against me, being I don’t see any conflict whatsoever. We have an election coming up. I think it’s the most important election in the history of our country. If for any chance, and it probably won’t… And I hope it doesn’t ever get to the Supreme Court. But if it did, I would think that she would rule one way or the other. I would think so.\nSavannah Guthrie: (54:26)\nBut for you? You think she would rule for you?\nPresident Trump: (54:28)\nI have no idea.\nSavannah Guthrie: (54:28)\nOf course she’ll rule one way or the other, but-\nPresident Trump: (54:31)\nBecause believe it or not, I never asked her about it. I never talked about it. I didn’t talk about any of the obvious things that you could talk about. And I think a lot of people in my position might. But in speaking to a lot of very brilliant people and people that do this for a living, they say it’s better not to talk. So I talked to her about life. I talked to her about the fact, “Would you like to do this? Are you willing to do this?” Because it’s a tremendous burden. The answer was, “Yes.” She’s unbelievably well-qualified, but I never spoke to her about these various questions.\nSavannah Guthrie: (55:04)\nLet’s get our next voter. She’s leaning to you, Mr. President. She voted for you in 2016. She is a registered Republican. Her name is Moriah Greene. Mariah, what’s your question?\nPresident Trump: (55:13)\nThank you very much.\nMoriah Geene: (55:15)\nThank you. Good evening, Mr. President. I’m honored to be with you here tonight, sir. So thank you. I’m a pro-life millennial. And my question for you today is, if Roe v. Wade is ultimately overturned in the future, what protections would be put in place or kept for where the mother’s life is in jeopardy in relation to high risk pregnancies?\nPresident Trump: (55:36)\nWell, again, I’m not ruling on this. And Roe v. Wade is something that a lot of people would say, obviously, you’re going to speak to somebody. Also two other great Justices, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh… I never spoke to them about Roe v. Wade. I never spoke to them about election laws. I never spoke to them about anything. And I’ve done the right thing from a moral standpoint. I don’t even know from a legal standpoint, but it was the right thing. I think, depending on what happens with Roe v. Wade, I think that perhaps it could get sent down to the states, and the states would decide. I also think perhaps nothing will happen. I have not talked to her about it. I think it would be inappropriate to talk to her about it. And some people would say, “You can talk to about it.” I just think it would be inappropriate.\nSavannah Guthrie: (56:22)\nBut what is your preference? Because agreed, that’s not something you should talk to the judge about. But would you like to see Roe versus Wade overturned?\nPresident Trump: (56:31)\nI would like to see a brilliant jurist, a brilliant person who has done this in great depth and has actually skirted this issue for a long time, make a decision. And that’s why I chose her. I think that she’s going to make a great decision. I did not tell her what decision to make. And I think it would be inappropriate to say right now, because I don’t want to do anything to influence her. I want her to get approved, and then I want her to go by the law. And I know she’s going to make a great decision for our country, along with the other two people I put there.\nSavannah Guthrie: (57:03)\nYou’re running as a pro-life Republican. Most pro-life Republicans would like to see Roe v. Wade overturned and abortion banned.\nPresident Trump: (57:09)\nMany of them would. Perhaps most of them would. I am telling you, I don’t want to do anything to influence anything right now. I don’t want to go out tomorrow and say, “Oh, he’s trying to give her a signal.” Because I didn’t speak to her about it. I’ve done the right thing in so doing. How she’s going to rule, you’re going to find out perhaps. Or you might not find out. It may never get there. It may never get there. We’ll see what happens.\nSavannah Guthrie: (57:32)\nAll right. We have another question. This is Cindy Velez. She is undecided. She says she’s leaning to Biden, and she did vote for Clinton in 2016. She’s registered as a Democrat. Hi Cindy. What’s your question?\nCindy Velez: (57:43)\nGood evening, Savannah.\nPresident Trump: (57:44)\nHi, Cindy. Thank you.\nCindy Velez: (57:44)\nGood evening, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump: (57:45)\nThank you very much.\nCindy Velez: (57:47)\nAs the mother of a young male of color, I have reason to respect authority, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but also out of fear that he may face profiling or be considered a criminal. As an educator, I’ve also had similar conversations with my high school students. Mr. President, what will you and your administration do to better prepare our law enforcement officers to work in collaboration with the communities that they serve and also to protect the lives of innocent Black and Latinos from police brutality and injustice?\nPresident Trump: (58:20)\nRight. I fully understand the question, and I saw everything that you saw over the summer. And it was a terrible thing, a terrible thing to watch. We have a Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina. He came up with a bill that should have been approved. It was great. It was a bill that was strong in terms of law enforcement, and strong in terms of enforcing the proper thing, and doing the proper thing by law enforcement. And the Democrats just wouldn’t go for it. They wouldn’t go for it at all. And I don’t know why, because it was a really great bill. But I do have to say this. And some people don’t like it when I say it, but a lot of people agree. I have done more for the African American community than any president. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln. Criminal justice reform, prison reform, historically Black colleges and universities. I got them funded.\nPresident Trump: (59:12)\nThey were on a year to year basis. They could have been put out of business. As soon as our country had a little bad year, they would have said, “I’m sorry, we’re not going to fund you.” I got them 10 year funding and financing. And more than they even asked for. I became very friendly with a lot of the heads. But we’ve done more… And of course, opportunity zones. But criminal justice reform, everybody said it could not be done. President Obama and Biden never even tried to do it. They never even tried. But I say that, and I say it often. I’ll say it loud, and I’m very proud of it. And I have a great relationship because of what I’ve done with the African-American community. I’m very proud of it.\nSavannah Guthrie: (59:50)\nLet’s go to our next question. We have Paulette Dale, she leans slightly to Biden. She voted for Clinton in 2016. She’s registered as a Republican. Paulette, what’s your question?\nPaulette Dale: (59:58)\nThank you. Good evening, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump: (01:00:00)\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nPaulette Dale: (01:00:01)\nI have to say, you have a great smile.\nPresident Trump: (01:00:04)\nGot you. Thank you.\nPaulette Dale: (01:00:09)\nHe does. You’re so handsome when you smile. As the daughter of immigrants to the United States who fled Eastern Europe due to religious persecution, the United States immigration policies are very personal for me.\nPresident Trump: (01:00:25)\nRight.\nPaulette Dale: (01:00:27)\nSurveys show that most Americans, and the majority of Republicans, support the Dreamers program. So my question for you, Mr. President, is if you are elected to a second term, do you expect to pursue your previous efforts to cut the DACA program?\nPresident Trump: (01:00:51)\nYeah.\nPaulette Dale: (01:00:51)\nWhy or why not?\nPresident Trump: (01:00:54)\nDACA is somewhat different than Dreamers. You understand that, and you understand it better than anybody, probably, in this room. Where do you come from, by the way, originally? Where?\nPaulette Dale: (01:01:02)\nMy grandparents were from Russia and Poland.\nPresident Trump: (01:01:05)\nThat’s very good. Okay. So we are going to take care of DACA. We’re going to take care of Dreamer. It’s working right now. We’re negotiating different aspects of immigration and immigration law. We’ve built now, over 400 miles of border wall, southern border. Mexico is working very closely with us. We have the strongest border we’ve ever had. We want people to come into our country. They have to come in legally. But we are working very hard on the DACA program. And you will be, I think, very happy over the course of the next year.\nPaulette Dale: (01:01:39)\nThank you.\nPresident Trump: (01:01:39)\nBecause I feel the same way as you do about it.\nPaulette Dale: (01:01:41)\nThank you, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump: (01:01:41)\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nSavannah Guthrie: (01:01:43)\nMr. President, in point of fact, the DACA program… Under your administration, no new applicants are allowed. And in fact, the DACA recipients now have to renew every year as opposed to every two years. So in fact, the DACA program has been curtailed by your administration.\nPresident Trump: (01:01:59)\nWell, what happens is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front. Mexico is heavily infected, as you know. And we’ve made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic, and other reasons, and crime. But we have a very strong border right now, and we have to keep it that way. But we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in through a merit system, and they have to come in legally. And people are very, very happy with it. You haven’t heard any complaints about that. But what happened is because of the pandemic, we have to be extra cautious.\nSavannah Guthrie: (01:02:32)\nYou have been promising this immigration bill since, well, at least July, when you told my colleague on Telemundo it was coming. But nothing’s come yet.\nPresident Trump: (01:02:39)\nIt’s very happy. The fact is, we got rid of catch and release, which is a disaster. You catch somebody. They could be a murderer. That could be a rapist, and we’re supposed to release them into our country. These are the laws that I inherited. We ended that program. Now, I think you’re going to see something very, very good. The whole immigration… If you look at what’s going on, people used to pour into our country. And especially during the pandemic, I think even you, Savannah, will be very impressed with what we’ve done.\nSavannah Guthrie: (01:03:06)\nSir, we have about 30 seconds left.\nPresident Trump: (01:03:07)\nSure.\nSavannah Guthrie: (01:03:07)\nI think about people sitting out there tonight. There are some who love you. Some of them are sitting right around here, and some who will never vote for you. But there are people in the middle. There are people who aren’t sure.\nPresident Trump: (01:03:16)\nThat’s right.\nSavannah Guthrie: (01:03:17)\nThere are people who want to know why they should give you a second chance and how you might improve in a second term. 30 seconds. What would you say to them?\nPresident Trump: (01:03:25)\nBecause I’ve done a great job. We have the strongest economy in the world. We closed it up. We are coming around the corner. The vaccines are coming out soon, and our economy is strong. We are at a level with jobs like we’ve never been before. We’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve rebuilt our borders. We had no borders. We had no nothing. We’ve rebuilt so much. We’ve given you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country. Greatest regulation cut, equally as important. And we created new levels of jobs that nobody thought was possible. And next year is going to be better than ever before.\nSavannah Guthrie: (01:04:00)\nI got to leave it there. I got a wrap from the control room. Mr. President, thank you for your time.\nPresident Trump: (01:04:05)\nThank you very much.\nSavannah Guthrie: (01:04:06)\nThank you for listening to the voters’ questions. That concludes our town hall. We do want to thank the president again, as well as our audience in hot Miami, and all of you watching at home. And a reminder, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are scheduled to meet in person a week from tonight in Nashville, a second and final presidential debate, moderated by our own Kristen Welker. Have a good evening, and thanks for being with us.",

         "Donald Trump: (01:25)\nThank you very much. Thank you. Let’s see, it’s 1:30. This is a hell of a crowd for 1:30 in the afternoon. Thank you.\nDonald Trump: (01:41)\nGreat state. It’s fantastic to be back in North Carolina with thousands of loyal, hard working Americans patriots. 19 days from now, think of that, 19 days, do you believe this? We’re going to win the State of North Carolina, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins. Do you see what’s going on? When we win, North Carolina wins and America wins. It’s very simple.\nDonald Trump: (02:22)\nFor the last 47 years. Joe Biden’s betrayed the workers of North Carolina through one act of economic treachery after another and now you see what’s happening. They got caught stealing folks. Biden’s a servant of the wealthy donors and globalist and special interests who got rich bleeding America dry, taking your jobs from North Carolina and every other place and moving them out of the country. We turned it around. You got to remember that.\nDonald Trump: (02:56)\nThese corrupt forces, they don’t see our nation as a protector of its citizens, but as a vehicle for personal profit and power at your expense, and you see it happening right now. They hold everyone in contempt and they always put the American worker last and that’s what’s happened until I came along. In fact, it’s the primary reason I came along if you think about it.\nDonald Trump: (03:24)\nThey keep their jobs while outsourcing your jobs to other countries, countries that you’ve never even heard about. They build walls for themselves while forcing your family to suffer the consequences of illegal immigration, drugs, and crime. You know it very well over here.\nDonald Trump: (03:42)\nFor five decades, Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars, and you know, they’re all coming back, they’re almost back, our great soldiers. Our great soldiers. Countries you’d never even heard about. He’s the embodiment of the political class that enriched itself while draining economic life and soul out of our country.\nDonald Trump: (04:15)\nYesterday, we learned from newly released emails, and I want to thank the New York Post for showing real bravery, that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and he has been corrupt for many years and everybody in Washington knew it.\nDonald Trump: (04:46)\nAnd just now, a little while ago, a new story shows up that Hunter made a deal with a wealthy Chinese business magnet for $10 million a year for introductions only. Introductions. I don’t know, “Will you take 10 million a year to introduce people?” “Yeah to introduce dad. Dad say hello, and by the way, dad give them everything they want. Okay? Give them everything they want dad.”\nDonald Trump: (05:14)\nHunter also referred to another more lasting and lucrative arrangement with the same Chinese businessman that, “Would be so much more interesting to me and my family,” that’s what he said. That’s a quote. These deals were made at the same time Joe Biden was letting China steal your jobs and take away your factories.\nDonald Trump: (05:34)\nIf Biden is elected, the United States will be owned by China, but we don’t have to worry about it because I can’t believe it’s going to happen. He’s shot, just so we understand. We cannot have a leader that’s just about half-shot. Can we believe we’re even fighting against this guy? But you know what? They’re a powerful party. They’re very corrupt party. They’re in bed with the media, the fake news, right back there.\nDonald Trump: (06:13)\nAnd totally protected by big tech. If I said what he said, they’d be calling for me out of there in 24 hours, what this guy has said. Two days ago, he said, “I’m running for the United States Senate.” That’s the third time he said it, “I’m running for the …” Now, that’s not like a regular mistake. You can make a mistakes. He said that, and then he said other things, but we won’t even get into it. This is crazy. This is the craziest race.\nDonald Trump: (06:41)\nYou know what? I’m running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics, and if I lose, it puts more pressure. I wish he was good. I wish he was good, I’d have less pressure. You know what I mean? How do you lose to a guy like this? Like how do you lose to a guy like this? And by the way, we’re leading in North Carolina, a poll just came in. I think we’re leading everywhere where people are intelligent actually. And you actually … We just got a report, the lines are through the roof on areas that would more typically vote for us. I’m trying to be diplomatic when I say that. Thank you. But this election is a matter of national security. It really is. We can’t let this happen. It’s a matter of national security. The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. Now, big tech, you see what’s going on with big tech? Is censoring these stories to try and get Biden out of this impossible jam. He’s in a big jam. You know, his son left his laptop at some place, “Fix my laptop.” He forgot to pick it up. The guy from the laptop, it looks like he saw it. He said, “Wow, this is really criminal stuff.” He brought it to the FBI. Can you believe this?\nDonald Trump: (08:13)\nThis could only happen to me and the people of North Carolina, no this could only happen to us. Can you imagine, he’s fixing a laptop? He says, “This is really bad stuff. I think I’ll bring it into law enforcement.” Anyway, they’ve got it. They’ve got a lot of them. I hear they have stuff coming out you won’t even believe, yeah you’ll believe it. He and his family are crooked and they were caught. They got caught. Now they’re being protected by big tech and if big tech persists in coordination with the mainstream media, we must immediately strip them of their Section 230 protection. Okay, it’s very simple.\nDonald Trump: (08:52)\nWe all believe in freedom of the press, but don’t big tech got something years ago that let them become big tech, they got total protection. They don’t get sued. They don’t get anything, they’re totally protected. So the government gave that, so that takes away that little feeling that, “Oh gee, we can’t talk to them about freedom of the press, et cetera.” No, we’re going to take away their Section 230, unless they shape up.\nDonald Trump: (09:20)\nBelieve it or not, even the Democrats agree. Of course, the only problem we have when they say that we’re against, it’s like the wall, you know, we’re building the wall? It’s going up. It was so hard. It was so hard getting that done. There was very few people who could have gotten that done. We’re up over 400 miles, but here’s what’s happened. I just think back. All I had to say is, “We will not build a wall,” they would’ve given me so much money. I had to say we were building it, but we got to going and we have the safest Southern border we’ve ever had so that’s all good.\nDonald Trump: (09:53)\nIn 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president of the United States who put America first. And we’ve done a job. We’ve done a great job. It’s been amazing. Our comeback, nobody’s ever done anything like what we did, and then we got hit by the China plague. Shouldn’t have let it happen. We’re now coming back at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. Nobody thought it was possible. They thought we’d be at 42% unemployment. We just had 7.8%. Can you believe it?\nDonald Trump: (10:42)\nNow, we were in 3.5%? I even went to North Carolina. I needed a good chief of staff. I said, “Where is he? Where’s Mark Meadows?” Where’s Mark? Where’s Mark? Come here Mark. Come here. Can you imagine? I had to go to North Carolina to find my chief of staff. No, he’s great. No, he’s done a great job. He’s done a great job. He followed me and I said, “You know what? I just tested positive.” He didn’t care. He was in that helicopter. Hey, he’s from North Carolina, what can I say? Yeah, he’s great. Doing a great job.\nDonald Trump: (11:40)\nYou elected me to restore the principle that’s a nation’s first duty, and it’s to its own citizens. We’re about our country, right? I’m president of our country. We’re not president of the world. We’re not president of the world. The USA. So if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always seem to be playing by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than any other president has ever fought for our country’s people.\nDonald Trump: (12:25)\nRight now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus and we’re doing really a good job. We’re rounding the turn. You see what’s going on in Europe? It’s flaming up. These characters back there, they say, “Well look at Europe.” Well, I’ll tell you what, go take a look, go take a look. No, we’re doing a great job. We’re doing a great job. They didn’t give the credit. I don’t want the credit. But our vice president worked 24 hours a day, Mike Pence. And we had a lot of governors. They worked with us, but we had some that were really good, and some that were really not so good. I’ll let you know one day, I’ll write a little book and I’ll tell you who the good ones were.\nDonald Trump: (13:06)\nWe made a lot of people look good. We’ve done a great job. We have some incredible statistics, but we want to rebuild the economy and that’s happening quickly. We had the greatest economy we’ve ever had. Think of it. Now, we closed it down and we saved 2 million lives by closing it down. We closed it down and now we’re building it back up, and by the way, North Carolina, tell you governor, “Open up your state, open up your schools.” Right? Right?\nDonald Trump: (13:43)\nThey’ll announce on November 4th, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’re opening up by North Carolina, and by the way, Pennsylvania.” You know, we’ve been suing a lot of states that are run by Democrats, right? I always call them high crime. But the fact is that’s where the crime is. But we’ve been suing a lot of people and we just won in Michigan against … what she did was terrible. I mean, she did … It’s like a prison warden. So Michigan, we won on a constitutional basis to have to open it up. You got to open this one up. I mean the people want to get back. The kids want to be back in school, 99.9%.\nDonald Trump: (14:22)\nLike you heard yesterday, they announced, my Baron, my tall Baron, he’s very tall. My beautiful Baron, and handsome, he is handsome, but my beautiful Baron had it, he recovered like so fast. I said, “Wait a minute. How long did that take?” They have the strongest immune systems, they’re better than all of us. That’s what they are, they’re kids, for some reason. But we’ve learned about this disease. You got to open up your businesses, open up your schools, get it going.\nDonald Trump: (14:49)\nWe have incredible therapeutics, have incredible drugs. We have, in my opinion, a cure because I took something, Regeneron. It was highly sophisticated stuff, the antibodies, and Eli Lilly makes an incredible drug. What we’ve done is incredible. This is all been over the last six months. It’s all happened. We got the FDA for fast approvals. They would have taken years and years and they’re doing it … They came to me on one, “Sir, this will take approximately two years.” I said, “Nope, I needed to prove tomorrow.” They said, “That’s not good.” We got it too. We got it.\nDonald Trump: (15:23)\nBut this is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain, in exchange for his party’s nomination, he has handed control of the socialists … I mean he’s given control of this party, the Democrats, they used to be like normal people. Now they’re socialists, Marxists, communists. That’s right. You said it, I didn’t say it, communists. Some people would say far left lunatics. Look at the Green New Deal.\nDonald Trump: (15:55)\nWell, don’t clap too hard. Go out and vote. We’ll clap later because these people are crazy. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country because they’re addicted to power, and God help us if they win, we won’t have our country anymore, and it’ll never be able to come back. They never do.\nDonald Trump: (16:15)\nIf you look at 20 years ago, Venezuela had oil, it had wealth, less than 20 years ago, it had everything. Now they don’t have water. They don’t have food. They don’t have medicine. They have nothing but killing all over their streets. This happened in a short period of time and it’s the same ideology. You see it. The Democrat party talks about decency and decorum while they demonize and cancel, you know the word cancel, right? They want to cancel your culture and persecute anyone who refuses to bend to their will. I don’t think they like me too much, do they? They don’t like me too much. That’s really an honor. That’s an honor. You know why? Because those words, nobody has ever heard them at a political event. I liked Ronald Reagan and they’d say, “We like you Ronald Reagan,” but nobody’s ever heard those words, right? “We love you.” No, seriously? What politician has ever heard those words? I’ve never said those words and that happens and I consider that a great honor and thank you very much. Thank you.\nDonald Trump: (17:39)\nBut the Democrats smear decent Americans as racist, slander our nation as evil. Indoctrinate our children and incite anti-American riots on our streets that we could control in 25 minutes, as we did in Minneapolis, as we do wherever we go, but they have to invite us in. By law, they have to invite us in. We want to go to Portland so bad. That one would take 15 minutes to set. 15 minutes.\nDonald Trump: (18:08)\nThe man that shot another innocent man, this was an innocent man shot, killed, instantly killed. I said, “What happened?” “Well, we haven’t arrested him.” Two days. Three days went by. We sent in the US Marshals, it took 15 minutes, it was over. 15 minutes it was over. We got him. They knew who he was. They didn’t want to arrest him and 15 minutes that ended.\nDonald Trump: (18:34)\nAnyway, and they call themselves peaceful protesters. In theory, we’re not supposed to be … and look at all the masks. They keep saying, “Nobody wears masks, wear the masks.” Although then they come out with things today. Did you see, the CDC? That 85% of the people wearing the mask catch it, okay?\nDonald Trump: (18:55)\nThen you have my friend, and he’s a nice guy, Tony, Tony Fauci. He’s a nice guy. He said, “This is not a threat. This is not a problem. Don’t worry about it, [inaudible 00:19:04] a problem.” It’s the craziest thing. Then he said, “Do not wear a mask. Do not wear a mask under any circumstances. Don’t wear a mask. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.” Right? So we don’t wear a mask. Then they say, “Oh, wear a mask.” I never saw … Do you ever see any conflicts? But he’s a nice guy. So I keep him around. Right? We’ll keep him around.\nDonald Trump: (19:22)\nHe’s a Democrat, everybody knows that. He’s Cuomo’s friend. Cuomo did the worst job of any governor in the United States. Almost 40,000 people died, more, and 11,000 at least, and you know, I gave him this big convention center, 2,800 beds. He didn’t use it. I gave him a ship. I gave him the great hospital ship meant for wars, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of incredible … You have to see the ship. I’ve been on it many times, it’s incredible. They didn’t use it. Instead, they sent sick people back into nursing homes, right? It’s a disgrace. The Democrat party is ashamed of America. The Republican party is proud of America and that’s a big difference. A big difference. Thank you.\nDonald Trump: (20:28)\nSo you know, I’m being set up tonight, right? So I’m doing this town hall with a Concast, C-O-N, right? Con, because it’s a con-job, Concast, C-O-N, not C-O-M. C-O-N-cast. So I’m doing it, and it’s NBC, the worst. It’s the home of sleepy eyes, Chuck Todd, and some others. They gave Lester Holt, he’s a beauty. They gave Joe Biden, a week ago, a town hall, and it was meant for children. In fact, speaking of Baron Trump, he fully recovered in like record time, Baron Trump would do great …\nDonald Trump: (21:03)\nTrump fully recovered in record time. Barron Trump would do great on that show, because he’s a young child. They ask him questions that a child could answer, any child, a smart child, not such a smart child. And they got taken apart. It was a joke. It was a joke. And so they asked me if I’d do it, and I figured, what the hell? We get a free hour on television, and we have Savannah Guthrie. She’s always lovely, isn’t she? But I figure, why not? Watch the difference in tone between what they did to this guy, that kid put two sentences together, and what they do to me. But with me, it’s me. It’s a life. We know what we’re doing and we just go on and we do it, but they’re doing him on doing him on ABC. And actually I’d like to watch him because I want to see if he can make it through the program.\nDonald Trump: (21:51)\nAnd, honestly, they’ll be so soft. George Stephanopoulos, I did him a couple of weeks ago. It was fine. His questions were unfair. They said that the audience is neutral. Turned out that they only had Never-Trumpers in there. But these are minor, little minor facts. Well, that happened with the other guy too. It was supposed to be neutral. It turned out that they were all big Democrats, right? Big Democrats. Because you know what? The fake news media is corrupt. It’s corrupt, and we’ve shown it so many times. So I’ll see you later on NBC, I look forward to it. We’re going to be doing it from Miami, where we’re doing very well in Florida too, by the way. We just got numbers back. Doing very well. And the senior citizens are liking us, I think, more and more every day. Every day, they see what we’re doing. Every single day. But we’re going to be doing that from Florida, so you’ll watch tonight. If you want to have a little entertainment, watch.\nDonald Trump: (22:47)\nLet’s just see. I just want to see the tone of the way they treated this character and the way they treat us. It’s not me, it’s us, the way they treat us. So the candidate whose supporters are burning American flags, and I say all the time, let’s put in some kind of a major, major resolution, you burn an American flag, you spent one year in jail. Do it.\nSpeaker 1: (23:12)\nU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nDonald Trump: (23:31)\nSee, that’s where the politicians are weak. The politicians could do this. That’s where they’re weak, the politicians. And I think it lost five to four in the Supreme Court. Now we have a different Supreme Court. Hey, by the way, can you imagine, we’re going to have number three in one term, which is a record, a record. President’s go an entire, Presidency, one term, two terms, without ever having to pick a Supreme Court. I have three in the first term. Their heads are exploding. These people can’t believe it. You know what? Our friends over here, they can’t believe what’s happening, I’ll tell you. But we have three. And how good is Amy? How good is Amy?\nSpeaker 1: (24:14)\nFill that seat! Fill that seat!\nDonald Trump: (24:27)\nIt’s happening.\nSpeaker 1: (24:28)\nFill that seat!\nDonald Trump: (24:31)\nThey said, “He should not be able to do this.” I said, “Why? I’m in my fourth year.” “He should not be allowed to do it.” But then they have a quote from Justice Ginsburg talking about, I guess it was Obama, right, that, “Well, wait a minute. He’s elected for four years. He’s not elected for three years.” That didn’t help them. That didn’t help their cause. No, we got it done. It looks like it’s going to be done very soon. They have a one week period where they sit, but they’re getting out of committee and it’s very exciting. And I’ll tell you what, she’s been flawless. She hasn’t made a mistake. She’s toying with those Democrat evil people. They’re evil. The way they treated Justice Kavanaugh was one of the greatest disgraces. I’ve never seen anything like it, and I’ve watched a lot of unfair things. I get treated that way all the time.\nDonald Trump: (25:23)\nBut I want to tell you, I’ve never seen anything like it, the way they went after Justice Kavanaugh with false accusations and everything else. It’s a disgrace, but they’re not playing that card here. They’re not playing that card, at least so far they’re not, but we’ll be watching very closely. But she’s been spectacular. She’s getting rave reviews. She’s a great intellect. Her professor, who was a great professor many years, said the single greatest student that he’s ever had. That meant something to him. It’s always nice. As long as you’re doing it, you might as well put smart people. Now, they’ll say, “He discriminates. He discriminates against others.” No, I like to have smart people on the Supreme Court, and she’s been great.\nDonald Trump: (26:03)\nBut the candidate whose supporters are tearing down our statues is not going to deliver any civility. And by the way, we solve every problem. And these are Democrat, radical left usually, but Democrat areas that are having these high crime. The Republicans are doing fantastically well, remember it. No cash bail. They do things that nobody could even conceive of and they’re out of control. But you know what’s going to bring it all together? Success, because we were bringing it all together before the plague came in from China. Should have never happened. They shouldn’t have let it happen. They let it happen. We’re not forgetting. They’ll pay for it. But before the plague came in from China … Well, Biden’s not going to make them pay. He’s going to get cash. They paid his son a lot of money. What’s he going to do? Say, “Hey, you shouldn’t do this.”\nDonald Trump: (26:54)\nAnd that’s true. That’s common sense. Look at the money they’ve out of China. I’ll tell you what, he really is, he’s a corrupt politician, just remember it. And I’m going to say it more and more, and Facebook and all can try and shut us down. But you know what? Everybody knows it. You don’t have a kid who gets thrown out of the military, hasn’t got a job for a long time, his father becomes the Vice President, and now this kid’s going into every country, walking away with millions of dollars from every country with no talent, no skill, no expertise. And the press doesn’t want to cover it because they’re corrupt. Is that true? I mean, how true is that? And then you look at the way Joe Biden lives. He lives on a politician’s salary for his whole life. 47 years, right? And he lives in these beautiful houses all over the place.\nDonald Trump: (27:45)\nI haven’t seen him, but he’s a politician and you’re not supposed to live like you’ve made $20 million a year. So he’s corrupt as hell and everyone knows it. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your job, and that’s what they’ve done. They’ve killed your jobs, dismantle your police departments, and that’s what they’re doing. Dissolve your borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes by four times. And how about this? How about the fracking? There will be no fracking. That’s when everybody was against, because the super radical left primaries, right? There will be no fracking. Here’s Biden. “No, I said there will be. How many times do I have to say it? There will be no fracking.” Now he gets the nomination. The following day, he said, “No, that will be fracking.” And I said, “Okay, he’s going to get killed by the media on this.” They never even asked him the question.\nDonald Trump: (28:41)\nI hope you’re watching Pennsylvania because you will lose one million fracking jobs almost immediately, because you know what? Joe has no control over that party. That’s all AOC and Crazy Bernie and all these maniacs. But we were coming together really well. I was getting calls from people that normally I wouldn’t want and they wouldn’t want me, and they’re saying, “It’s amazing.” We had the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had. We had 160 million people working. Think about it, 160 million. We were never even close. We were beating China at a level that they’ve never been beaten before. I was charging them tariffs. They didn’t know what the hell to do. And they were always going to overtake us in 2019. If you go back 15, 20 years, 10 years, China was always going to overtake us, 2019. Well, in 2019, we became much, much bigger and we were way overtaking them and they weren’t even close to overtaking us. It was just the opposite.\nDonald Trump: (29:48)\nWe were coming together as a country because everything was good. Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, people with diplomas, people without diplomas, people with no high school education, PhDs from MIT, everybody was coming together. And then we had the plague. But that’s going to bring us together again because you had your best year in the history of your state. You had the best year last year in the history of your state. You’re going to have a better year coming up. This is going to be a better year. And watch your third quarter, watch your third quarter. But the radical Democrats will confiscate your guns, destroy your suburbs. I keep hearing about the suburban women. The American dream, it is. I let you have the American dream. I wiped out a regulation that will destroy the suburbs. Do you know that? You know about that. I wiped it out, right? They don’t want to have a project built next to their beautiful house, right?\nDonald Trump: (31:03)\nSo why is it that the fake news keeps saying that women aren’t going to like Trump? You know what women want more than anything else? They want safety, security, and they want to be able to have their houses and leave me alone. The suburban woman. And then early on, before I realized it wasn’t politically correct, sorry, folks, haven’t been doing this too long, I said, “The suburban housewife loves Trump.” And by the way, the women, they loved it. Does anybody mind that term? Is that a bad term? The only people that mind it are those people there with the cameras. Look at them. Look how innocent they look, and they’re not innocent. They’re not innocent. The enemy of the people. I call them the enemy of the people. But, anyway, so the suburban women should love Trump. Now, this is the same thing, this is like a carbon copy of what happened last time, not nearly as bad.\nDonald Trump: (32:03)\nRemember, you had nine states. I was going to lose all of them the day before. And they were just wrong a little bit. I won all of them. I was going to lose all nine. They said, “This will be a horrible evening for Donald Trump.” That wasn’t President Trump. That was Donald Trump. “This evening will be over very shortly.” Then we went and Florida. We win North Carolina, by the way. We win South Carolina. We win Georgia. We ran the coast. We just ran it one after another. And remember it said, they had this little crazy chart on NBC, and that’s when the people started crying that worked there. “Oh my God, what am I going to tell my wife after two and a half years of saying, he’s not going to make it.” And remember it said 3%. I had a 3% chance, right? So it’s at 3%. Then we won Utah. Remember, we were supposed to lose Utah. We only won by 22 points. Very accurate. So we win you Utah.\nDonald Trump: (33:05)\nSo it goes 3%, 5%, 8%, 12%, 21%. Now they’re saying, “Man, that sucker. That number is getting bad up there, that little number.” Then it started getting smaller, because they made the numbers small, but the number was actually getting bigger. 21%, 25%. Then we won a place called North Carolina. So it went from 25% to 32% right through that evening. Wasn’t that a great evening? Started off with Ohio. Remember, “You cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.” I heard that for a year. And then we won Ohio by 8.7. So everyone said, “Nobody wins it by eight.” By the way, we’re doing better there now that we did four years ago. The great Jim Jordan and all those guys. So we won by eight points and that was the beginning. They said, “Wait a minute. Not only did he win, he won by a lot.” But that was the little signal as to what was happening.\nDonald Trump: (34:10)\nSo then it goes to 25, then 31, 35. Now we hit the 42. So now I have a 42 chance of winning. And I’m looking at all these states and I’m leading in most of them, right? We won 32 or 34 States. So it goes 34, 38, and now they’re going, “Oh, what’s going on here?” And remember the guy, John King at CNN. And he’s good with the board. I like it. He’s got nice action. But it wasn’t so good that night. He was shaking And he’s going, “Okay, well, look, this is not looking good. This is not good. I don’t know.” And now he’s a nervous mess. And he’s going, “What’s going to happen?” Who’s there, Heather? Oh, Hemmer, Bill Hemmer. Well, Bill Hemmer’s a good guy, right? Bill Hemmer’s a good guy. Oh, he said, “Hemmer’s better.” I agree with that. Hemmer’s a good guy.\nDonald Trump: (35:06)\nBut you know what? It’s very interesting. So then we go from 42 to 48, 54, 60, 64, then 71. This is in our favor. Then 78. Then you see all the people screaming and crying. It was beautiful. The most beautiful convention center. They had that. Remember they had the earth that was shaped like the United States. And they had the podium on the state of Florida out there hanging out over. And I looked, I said, I said to our great First Lady, I said, “First Lady, that is the most beautiful looking thing I’ve ever seen.” The way they had it. They spent a fortune. But they knew something was wrong because they went to Grucci, and they were in the river at the convention center, and they had a big display of 4th of July, whatever the hell it is, the fireworks. And they paid a lot of money. But now they had to pay seven million. They owed $7 million to Grucci and they were all set to do it. And then they decided to cancel.\nDonald Trump: (36:10)\nSo I then called up Grucci. I said, “Listen, it’s way far away from my location, but I’ll give you a million dollars.” I tried to buy their fireworks. I figured I’d give New York, have a little fun. But I’ll never forget that beautiful. And it looked so beautiful. Five o’clock, it’s beautiful. They’re all looking like, oh, they’re going to have a big evening. And by eight o’clock in the evening, you watch these people. Remember the woman screaming, you know the one? Screaming. How about her? You think she’s a reasonable person to deal with? And she was screaming, they’re screaming. And they talked about the glass ceiling, right? The woman breaking the glass ceiling. And it didn’t work out that way. The glass ceiling broke her. But there will be a woman that breaks the glass ceiling. It just won’t be Hillary.\nDonald Trump: (36:58)\nAnd you know what else it won’t be? It won’t be Kamala. Won’t be. It won’t be Kamala. But we worry about her. I’m very concerned about her, because as you probably just heard just before I walked out, two of the people that traveled with her, her chief of staff and somebody else in the plane with her all the time, they have been tested positive for COVID- 19. So we extend our best wishes, right? Right? Yes? We extend our best wishes. We extend our best, which is more than they did to me. But that’s okay. That’s okay. So let’s see what happens. I mean, it’s a tricky thing. It’s dust. It’s a little tricky thing. Masks, no masks, everything, you can do all you want. But you still need help from the boss. You need help from the boss. That’s what happened. We needed help. Yeah, we needed help. It’s all right to say.\nDonald Trump: (38:14)\nNow, they’ll criticize me for that. “How dare he say that. How dare he say that.” No, I’ll say it. I’ll say it. I’ll say it. Somebody said to me the other day, “You’re the most famous person in the world by far.” I said, “No, I’m not. No, I’m not.” They said, “Yes, you are. I said, “No.” They said, “Who’s more famous?” I said, “Jesus Christ.” I’m not taking any chances. I’m not going to have it. Hey, I’m not having any arguments. Jesus Christ. I’m not going to take any chances, I guarantee. And let me look up and I’ll say and it’s not even close. To defend our Constitution, I proudly nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. It’s been so popular. A lot of people said I got elected because of the United States Supreme Court. I don’t know that it’s true. But when I ran, people knew who I was and all, but they didn’t know too much about my politics. And they figured maybe I’m liberal. Who knows? They didn’t.\nDonald Trump: (39:29)\nAnd they weren’t happy because they didn’t know who I was going to appoint as a Supreme Court Justice. Was I going to put a radical left person, like he will put? He’s got to give a list, by the way. Not only can he not pack the court, which would be horrible, horrible for our country, for that institution, but he’s got to give a list of 10, 12, 15, 20, 25 that he will only pick from, because people have to be able to see who he is going to pick. You can’t let somebody go up and put a crazy radical left justice in the Supreme Court. So I’m going a step further than them. They don’t press him much. How about if I said what he said? He said, “No, no, I’m not going to say. I’ll tell them after the election.” Oh, that’s great. That’s wonderful. And then these guys walk away. No, no, he’s got to say about packing the court, but he’s also got to say who from what group will he pick?\nDonald Trump: (40:24)\nGive the names because you have to know that. You have to know that. And they say that’s what won me the election. I don’t know if it’s true, but a lot of people say because I came up, and I was having a lot of, when I first went, had a lot of bike back, where people were saying, “Well, wait a minute. Who’s he going to pick as a Supreme Court Judge?” And I said to my people, who are some really great people, I said, “Give me the top 25.” It was 20, and then ultimately expanded to 25 judges, lawyers, group of people. “Give me the top 25 judges, et cetera, in the United States. I want the smartest, the best, the most brilliant, and I’m going to put them in a list.” And I didn’t know, I don’t think, almost any of them, but these are the most respected people. They believe in a thing called the Constitution, which Biden’s people won’t believe in. You’ll see some real beauties if they put in the truth. That’s why they don’t want to do that, because you couldn’t win an election if you had to do that.\nDonald Trump: (41:29)\nSo I said, “Give me the top 25,” and then I went out and I played a little bit cute. I said, “All right, I will pick somebody like these people.” And you know what, that didn’t play. They said, “No, you have to pick one of these people, two of these.” And that’s what I did. I said, “All I’ll do that.” And they say that was 20 or 25 points in terms of the percentages of what I got. It was a big thing on the United States Supreme Court. Well, I’ve done it again. I’ve now taken my original list and we had two great people put, as you-\nDonald Trump: (42:03)\n… original list. And we had two great people put as you know, Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch. And by the way, nobody’s ever suffered like Justice Kavanaugh, what he went through, nobody. But we put Justice, Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch. They’re fantastic intellects, fantastic people. And now we have Amy to go along with it and it’s going to be unbelievable. Another week they’ll be voting. The full Senate will be voting. And I don’t know what can stop it because she’s so good. It’s a freight train, okay. But the fact is, so we’ll have three, but you know what Joe Biden has to tell you who. Because the next president, whoever it may be, it better be us, because if it’s not, honestly, you will not have the same country because the next president, the next term will have anywhere from one, two, three, and even four picks, very unusual.\nDonald Trump: (43:04)\nI was very unusual at three. It’s a record for a term, but you know what? The next could have just by statistically one, two, three, or four. So your whole court as good as we’re doing now, and if I didn’t do this, you wouldn’t even have a 2nd Amendment. You wouldn’t have a 2nd Amendment, but if they put on two, three or four, that means they will override. And that’s good for 30, 40, 50 years. And the judges, they go in young and they last for a long time, which is nice. So Biden has to go out and he has to not only talk about not packing the court because anybody who wants to pack the court shouldn’t win. And Justice Ginsburg said that. She said, “No, the nine, we’re friendly, we get together. We’re for the country.”\nDonald Trump: (43:53)\nShe made the greatest case for nine. Once you get a big group of people, then you’re into the Senate, you’re into the House. We’ve already got that, right. And this is a great institution, maybe our greatest institution, and we can’t let some radical group of people destroy it. So number one, he can’t pack the court. And number two, he’s got to explain one of 25 or 30 or 40 or 50 people, but he’s got to put up a list of people from which he’ll choose. And the voters have to know who those people are and he can’t get away with I’ll tell you after the election and then destroy our country. He can’t do it. So that’s it. That’s it.\nDonald Trump: (44:39)\nThat’s much more interesting than going off a teleprompter when you think of that, but no, but you got to say it. You got to say it like it is. So Bidens’ agenda would be a catastrophe for North Carolina seniors and you know that better than anybody. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. People don’t know that about him, but he tried to cut your Social Security, great genius. He’s going to cut your Social Security and your Medicare. Now Biden’s pledging mass amnesty and free healthcare for illegal aliens. And you saw that three months ago when he’s on stage and he said to all of these very radical left candidates, “Who wants to give illegal aliens free healthcare?” And they all raise their hand and Biden didn’t and then you could see his right shoulder here it was the corpse. I say he’s the corpse. And his shoulder was… He was looking around, he didn’t know what the hell was happening, but he knew everyone else’s hand was up.\nDonald Trump: (45:39)\nRemember that though? He knew it was wrong. Look, he’s been there for 47 years, hasn’t done a damn thing. He’s been there 40… He knew it was wrong, but his right shoulder started moving. And I said, “I just won the election.” I said, “Isn’t that nice?” And you know what? We all have a heart, but what that does is it brings millions of people into our country. They all want to get health care. They want to get education. They want to get all the things that they want to give them and you can’t do it. You can’t afford it, but that’s what they want So we’re not going to let that happen because it’ll decimate Medicare and destroy your Social Security and everything else. While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare or your Social Security.\nDonald Trump: (46:23)\nAnd under my leadership, we’re developing the vaccines and therapies and all of those things and you vote for me, prosperity is happening. Already it’s happening. It’s happening so fast nobody can believe it. We’re the number one country in the world by far for economic comeback and we went down less than any other country. Think of that. Normal life, that’s what we want. We want normal. I don’t want to talk. We want normal. We want to get back to where we were nine months ago, eight months ago. We want to have those football stadiums, those great teams of yours, we want to have people sitting next to each other screaming like crazy. You look at the stands where you have a person and then 20 empty seats. Nah, that’s not it. And we’ll be back. We’re going to be back very soon. Next year will be maybe the greatest economic year, one of the greatest economic years, but maybe the greatest economic year. I think better than last year. Last year was your best. I think we’re going to do better.\nDonald Trump: (47:20)\nAnd to a large extent, this election’s about many things, but it’s between a Trump recovery and a Biden depression. Because if they get in, they’re going to raise your taxes quadruple. He says it. They’re going to allow millions of illegal aliens in, and they’re going to let regulations, all of the cutting that I’ve done in regulation, which is a number that no president has ever even come close to, whether they were four, eight, or in one case, more than that. They’re going to let all those regulations come back in. And the farmers know what I’m talking about and the tobacco growers know what I’m talking about because you couldn’t even farm your land. You had so many regulations. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate North Carolina’s economy with draconian, unscientific lock downs. He’ll keep you locked down except at a level that you’ve never seen before. You won’t have a state by the time this guy finishes up. Biden’s plan will crush America. My plan is already crushing the virus.\nDonald Trump: (48:26)\nLook at our numbers, look at our numbers. This week, oh dammit. He must have lost his job. He must’ve been a nice guy. I’m sure he lost his job. This week, even the failing New York Times, the poor writer, I read this and I said, “This guy is gone, but I didn’t know him so what the heck.” The New York Times said that, this is the quote, experts are saying, “With genuine confidence that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than anybody ever expected.” How about that? New York Times. That’s right. The writer of that article is gone now, but may he rest in peace.\nDonald Trump: (49:17)\nThey don’t want to say that. They’re not happy to hear that because they don’t really have our interest at heart. Our early and aggressive action save so many lives, millions of lives. We pioneered all of these incredible therapies and reduced the fatality rate 80, think of it, 85%. We understand the disease and we have things that work and I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received available to anybody that wants it that has a problem free. And it’s free because it wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t your fault and I only hope it works as well on you, but I’ll tell you, I felt like Superman a day later. Here I am. Here I am.\nDonald Trump: (50:07)\nI actually looked at the doctor. He’s here with us now. Great doctors. We had so many doctors. I never saw so many doctors, all geniuses, lowest IQ 187. And they weren’t thrilled. But I looked at them and said, “I don’t know what the hell you gave me, but I want some more of it.” No, it was a transfusion. And it was amazing so we’re going to make that available to everybody. We’re trying to get it immediately approved by the FDA. And Dr. Han is working at the FDA to get it. And hopefully you don’t need it. And for the most part, you won’t need it. I think for the most part, but you need it. We’re going to get it to you, and you’re going to get it and you’re going to get better. And I call it a cure. They call it a therapeutic. I called it a cure, Regeneron.\nDonald Trump: (50:52)\nAnd they have others that are very similar, great companies. I told you before, Eli Lilly, et cetera. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year. The vaccine will end the pandemic but it’s ending anyway. I mean, they go crazy when I say it. It’s going to peter out and it’s going to end, but we’re going to help the end and we’re going to make it a lot faster with the vaccine and with the therapeutics and frankly, with the cures. So we’re joined today by some incredible warriors and friends of ours, Congressman David Rouzer, where is he? David. David Rouzer. There’s our warrior. How are we doing David? We’re doing okay in this state? You’re doing good. Do you have any competition in the race? Any competition or not much?\nDavid Rouzer: (51:38)\nNot much.\nDonald Trump: (51:39)\nI love that. I like when they say, “Not much, sir,” but if they have, I’m always there to help, right. I’m there to help. Thank you, David. Great job. We have a candidate for North Carolina, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Catherine Truitt. Catherine. Great. Great. Thank you. Good job, Catherine. I heard that. Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, who just recovered herself by the way. For anybody that’s sitting, look, they’re all jumping. Oh, she just recovered. Let’s get the hell out of here. No, Ronna’s great. Where is Ronna? Right here. Thank you Ronna. She’s great. She did a great job. She ran Michigan for us four years ago. She did so well. And many, many decades since the Republican won Michigan, and we won Michigan.\nDonald Trump: (52:33)\nI said, “I want that person running the RNC. She’s great.” So Ronna, thank you very much. She just fully recovered from COVID. A lot of people are recovering. People are recovering 99%, 99 plus plus. And now with what you can do, one thing I do say, “Get there early. Get to the hospital early. Get there early.” They can do things. Lots of things, but don’t get there late. Get there early. And North Carolina GOP Chairman, a friend of ours, a great gentleman, Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael. Great job. How are we doing? Doing all right? Looking like a good win, right? And are the numbers that big standing online getting ready to vote, right? Bigger than you anticipated? He’s saying the right things. Thank you Michael. No, I hear. It was broadcast today. The numbers are crazy. You know what it’s called? And this is what we’re going to have. We’re going to have a red wave. That’s what they call it.\nDonald Trump: (53:37)\nThey don’t want to send in the balance and have the balance thrown away into a dumpster. Who are you for, Trump? Get rid of that one, get rid. This is the craziest thing: they want to vote. Our people want to go and they want to vote. It’s going to be a big, beautiful red wave and let them put in their deal and we’ll check in every one of them. We’re watching very closely where they came from, where they went, how did they get there, right, all this stuff that’s going on. Not a day goes by when you don’t read about what crooked thing is happening, but the red wave will crush it. And those are people that are going to get there on November 3rd and previous to that, the open voting when you can vote, but they’re going to get there and people are talking about it already and you’re seeing that aren’t you? Huh? You’re seeing that. That’s great Michael. That’s great. It’s going to be a lot of fun because there was a landslide. Well, we’re going to see. We’re going to see, but we got a good shot.\nDonald Trump: (54:35)\nNo, we’re doing great in Pennsylvania. We’re doing great in Michigan. Doing great in Arizona. I heard some very good numbers just now in Nevada. We’re doing good. I mean, we’re doing good all over the place. And I don’t want to say it too loud because they get all this money. They’ll spend money like crazy, but ultimately, money doesn’t get you there because I spent 25% of what Crooked Hillary spent, right. I spent 25%. And even after I won, they said, “He didn’t do as good a job at fundraising.” I said, “I spent less money and I got criticized that we won.” My father taught me a long time ago if you can win for less money, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing, right? Good thing. Right Michael? Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now we are doing it again. In my first three years, family income increased by $6, 000, more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. Think of that.\nDonald Trump: (55:40)\nSo we did really more than eight times. African American income grew nine times more than it did under Biden and Obama, nine times. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment all reached in history, record highs. Highest in history, and we’re getting them all back. They’re all coming back. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty. Since the China virus, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs. We have never produced jobs at that level and that speed. We’ve already cut the unemployment rate in half and think of it, 7.8 7.9. That sounds terrible. But it sounds pretty good when they’re telling you about the 42%, right? Because I figured 42, what are you going to do? We have this crazy situation that happened and 7.8%, it’s a pretty incredible when you think about it and we’ll get that way down and it’s going down fast. Well, yeah, just watch this. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost in their crisis. It wasn’t a crisis though.\nDonald Trump: (57:04)\nIt was not great times, but it wasn’t a crisis. We did it in five months. So they had 30 months and they had the weakest recovery in the history of our country dating back actually to when they started 1929. It was the weakest recovery in the history of our country and then he wants to tell us how to do things. For 47 years, he did nothing. I love these guys. For 47 years he did nothing, now all of a sudden he wants to do all these things that I did already. I could do better. You shouldn’t have let China in. Well, for two months he was saying I was xenophobic because I closed the borders very early didn’t I, huh? Jobs have been recovering 23 times faster than the Obama Biden recovery. 23 times. Not 23%, 23 times. And these numbers come from the great Larry Kudlow, who’s a good man by the way. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over us for 47 years. Think of it. Biden has waged the decades-long assault on your state against your state’s tobacco growers.\nDonald Trump: (58:15)\nHe was a cheerleader for NAFTA, which was a disaster, TPP, which would have been a disaster had I not terminated. It would have destroyed your state. It would have destroyed manufacturing in our country and he was totally in favor of China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. That’s when they took off like a rocket, but not so good anymore. For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of North Carolina workers. He should not be asking for your votes, he should be begging for your forgiveness. That’s what he should be doing. What a job he did. I mean, you go back four or five years, you people were hurting. You were hurting. I have plenty of friends in this state. You were hurting. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders, countries you never heard of. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA.\nSpeaker 2: (59:23)\nUSA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.\nDonald Trump: (59:23)\nThat’s probably the main reason I ran in the first place. And I made this statement the other day and it sort of made sense to me. If Obama and Biden did a good job, I would have never run. I mean, think. I only ran because they did a horrible job and there was no unity. You had Ferguson. Look at what happened in St. Louis. Look at what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened in Oakland. Look at what happened. There was hatred all over the place. Now they say, “Oh, wasn’t that beautiful.” What they did was they did a terrible job. That’s why I’m your president. Because if they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. I had a very nice life, believe me. And by the way, how many of these rallies have you? Stand up, please. North Carolina. What number is this? Don’t be embarrassed.\nSpeaker 3: (01:00:27)\n60.\nDonald Trump: (01:00:27)\nSix O?\nSpeaker 3: (01:00:28)\n60 times.\nDonald Trump: (01:00:29)\n60. They have a group of 12 women and I see them a lot. And I say, “North Carolina, they remind me of that no matter where we go.” And so 60, that’s a lot, but that’s only about 20%. So you have a long way to… I’m sure their husbands are thrilled. Where are you going? I’m going to, well, at least here you’re close, right?\nSpeaker 4: (01:00:55)\n1,000%.\nDonald Trump: (01:00:57)\nAnd you don’t mind, right?\nSpeaker 4: (01:00:58)\nNo.\nDonald Trump: (01:00:59)\nWe like him. We like him. Great women. Thank you very much. That’s really nice. Now, that’s really nice. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration’s Trans-Pacific Partnership. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA, which is just now kicking in and it’s turned out to be incredible for our farmers, our manufacturers. Everyone said it couldn’t be done. There’s no way you could end NAFTA. I ended it. It was one of the worst trade deals ever made. I took the toughest ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. We’ve achieved energy independence, and we’ve done it while protecting our pristine environment. We have the best environmental numbers we’ve ever had, meaning I guess over 50 years because before that you didn’t have too much action, right?\nDonald Trump: (01:01:53)\nBut we have the best environmental numbers, ozone numbers, so many other numbers. In the meantime, China, Russia, India, all these countries, they’re spewing stuff into the air. I keep telling our people. I say, “I love clean air, but Russia and China,” you look at a map. You have all these spots and India and many others are spewing it in. What do you suggest? Well, we don’t think you should sell straws anymore. Oh, great. Okay. That’s going to help. You ever hear that? The straw, right? And I say, “Okay, the straw is good. That’s a little straw. That’s okay. What about the plastic plate? What about the carton? What about the glass that’s out of plastic?” Well, we’ll get to that later. These people are crazy. I recently signed an order placing a moratorium on offshore drilling off the coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. So you don’t have to worry about any oil spills in your beautiful land. You don’t have to worry. Look how happy she is. She obviously lives on the water. You don’t have to worry about those spills. At the same time, I have made it…\nDonald Trump: (01:03:03)\nI don’t have to worry about those spills. At the same time, I have made it so great for energy. We’ve never had energy like we do. We’re number one in the world now by far, and totally energy independent. In 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American.\nDonald Trump: (01:03:24)\nI saw a Biden the other day. He’s standing here like this. And he’s got a sign, “Hire American.” I said, “I’ve been saying that for 15 years.” It’s amazing. And you know this one, when the Tennessee Valley Authority replaced part of its American workforce with foreign workers, I told the board chairman, “Chairman, you’re fired. Out. You’re fired, chairman.” You know what he was making? This had nothing to do with me. He was making $8 million a year. He’s the highest paid government official. Semi-government. It’s like a private, semi-private deal. $8 million a year. And I said, “You’re fired.” And what happened is, as soon as I said that they hired all the employees back from Tennessee and five other states, six other states. Mississippi\nDonald Trump: (01:04:17)\nThey’re all back, and they were great. They were great. So we do our little things, right? We did that one and it was great. My opponent’s immigration plan is the most extreme in the history of our country. Biden’s plan would eliminate US borders by implementing nationwide catch and release. That’s catch… A murderer comes over, you catch him. What do you do? Well, not much. Most of them don’t say they killed people. You catch them, you take their name, and you release them into our country. It was a big deal. It sounds easy. I ended it. But you want to see tough? Go through courts, goes through… But I ended it. I ended catch and release.\nDonald Trump: (01:04:57)\nOne of the worst things. Now we release them. You know where we release them? We release them back into their country. We don’t release them into our country anymore. We say, “Congratulations, we’ve got them.” Look at all those people standing up out there. Wow, sorry. Sorry we didn’t get you seats. Well, they’re strong. They’re strong people. They’re from North Carolina. Making every community into a sanctuary city, this is their goal. And suspending all removals of any illegal alien, no matter how bad they are. Murderers, rapists. They have a deal with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. He lost twice. Greatest loser of all time. He lost the first time and he took it, then he lost the second time. Elizabeth Warren should have dropped out, I’d be running against him. That would be okay. I don’t care. There’d be more energy. Smaller base, more energy.\nDonald Trump: (01:05:47)\nBut it happened twice to Bernie. But I would really be watching it very careful because it would be the total nullification of US borders. They don’t want borders. They want to have this country, and what would happen would be our country would be overwhelmed with illegal immigration coming in. Your jobs, crime would go through the roof. And now, as I said, we have the strongest southern border in the history of our country. Over 400 miles of wall.\nDonald Trump: (01:06:17)\nWall will be completed very soon. MS-13 and criminal cartels would have rampaged freely all over the country if it wasn’t for ICE and border patrol, so we’ve gotten rid of thousands of MS013. We delivered them back out of our country. We said, “Congratulations. Here they are. You take them. We’re not taking them.” These are some bad people. If Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone, and your safety is gone. It’s very simple. Biden has pledged with Bernie Sanders, they made agreement. You know what it is? They all agreed to a thing. We call it the manifesto. My idea. It’s called the manifesto.\nDonald Trump: (01:07:05)\nHe’s pledged to eliminate our requirement that newcomers to our society be financially self-reliant. We want them to be able to make a pledge that they’re not going to take from us, and he’ll provide unlimited welfare, he wants to, for anybody anywhere in the world that comes into our country. I said, “That’s a great idea. Where are we going to get the money, Sleepy Joe?” Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we’re finishing the wall. We’re up to now 407, I think. 406, 407. We’re doing 10 miles a week. Nobody believes it. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US Military. Defense spending in North Carolina has soared to more than $1 billion a year, many times what it was. And by the way, all made in the USA. We have the greatest machinery ever made by any nation in history. Russia, China, every one of them. They’re all jealous. What we have is not even to be talked about.\nDonald Trump: (01:08:16)\nI actually mentioned this in a rally about two months ago and they said, “He’s giving away information.” Now I’m not. I’m telling you something. We’ve got stuff that they dream about, all made in the USA. $2.5 trillion. And you know what? Hope to God… We’ve redone our nuclear. When number one in the world by far. It was going down the tubes. It was old and tired, but hope to God we never have to use it. Remember when I came in? They said, “With his personality, we’ll be in a war in the first week.” Where’s the war? Where’s the way? Remember? You would’ve have been in a war without me, because North Korea, we were going to have a nice nuclear war with North Korea. And now I get along great with him. And everyone says, “Oh, that’s terrible” that I get along. No, it’s a good thing. Getting along is a good thing, not a bad thing. And you get along through strength, not through weakness. You never get along through weakness.\nDonald Trump: (01:09:10)\nAnd we launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces, and I never even talked. When I came to North Carolina and talked to you, I never said this. So we actually did more than I promised. I’m the only politician, if you’d call me that. I’m the only politician that actually did more than I promised, because I never talked about the Space Force. I never talked about it, right? And as I sat for a year and I watched and I saw what was going on with Russia and with China and with others, I said, “Wait a minute, we’re going to fall away behind. We can’t do that.” And we launched the Space Force. And Jim Inhofe and some of the people in the Senate were fantastic, and the House. And we got it passed, so we have… First time in 75 years, think of that, a new force. And it’s a big force, and it’s an important one. We passed VA Choice for our veterans and VA Accountability for our veterans. Nobody thought that could happen. 42 years.\nDonald Trump: (01:10:10)\nAnd we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate. When I came in, it was a mess. They were all over the place. We took over 100% and we killed the leader of ISIS and founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were after him for 15 years. And we took out the world’s number one terrorist, the mass murder of many American troops and many other troops and many other people, Kasseem Salamoni is dead. And I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous $150 billion plus $1.8 billion in cash. Can you believe it? Five plane loads of cash. Figure that one. The Iran nuclear deal, a disaster. And you know the first call I’m going to get after we win? It’s going to be from Iran. “Can we make a deal?” Because their country’s going to hell with the sanctions and all of the things we’ve done, and they want to make a deal.\nDonald Trump: (01:11:09)\nI said, “Why don’t you wait till after the election?” I said, “But if you wait until after the election, it is going to be much tougher.” But I said, “Wait until after the election,” because you can’t make a deal now. You’ve going to see if sleepy Joe… Because if sleepy Joe gets in you’ll make the greatest deal ever made. And China will own us. Remember what I said. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Got it built. And we got it built, Mr. Congressman. We got it built.\nDonald Trump: (01:11:49)\nThey wanted $2 billion to build it. I said, “Maybe we could do cheaper.” I said to my people, I said, “You know this story. Find something. Maybe we own some land.” We did. It had a building on it. So we were going to spend $2 billion. I said, “Well, let’s renovate the existing building. Is it big enough?” “Oh, it’s too big, actually.” “And how’s the location?” “Much better than the one we were going to buy in Jerusalem.” I said, “Alright, come back with a price.” David Friedman, who’s one of the most successful lawyers. Now he’s the ambassador to Israel. So he calls me up two days later, he says, “Sir, I think we can do it for $350,000.”\nDonald Trump: (01:12:23)\nI said, “David.” From $2 billion. I said, “Well, what’s the difference between the $2 billion version and the $350,000?” He said, “Sir, honestly the $350,000 will have a better location, a better building. It’s actually better.” Now, who would believe stories like this? And I actually told him, I did something I don’t think, congressman, I’ve ever done in my life. I said, “David, it’s too cheap. It doesn’t sound good. Make it more expensive, please.” So we made it $500,000. Not bad, right? And we opened it up a few months later. So not only did we name Jerusalem, became the capital of Israel. We got the building built. This thing would’ve taken 10 years, 20 years. Would’ve cost $5 billion. It would have been ridiculous. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, they’ve been fighting over that for 52 years.\nDonald Trump: (01:13:16)\nAnd instead of endless wars, we’re forging peace in the Middle-East. I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. It’s true. And now he’s pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy your social security, and he would destroy all preexisting conditions. And you know it, and so does he. Biden’s running mate sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have 180 million people that love their private healthcare. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions. He’s agreed to this with crazy Bernie, by 700%. Think of that. Does that sound reasonable? Opening the flood Gates to radical Islamic terrorism. I said, “No, thank you.” He wants to ban school choice and charter schools. And in a second term, and I’ve already started, we will provide school choice to every parent in America. One of the most important things.\nDonald Trump: (01:14:27)\nA vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and limitless future. A limitless future for all Americans. And just in concluding, first of all it’s great to be with you on this gorgeous day. This is beautiful. Been a great state. My granddaughter, you what happened, right? You know the name of my granddaughter? Carolina. Carolina. Am I allowed to say that to South Carolina? Because I love them too. Can I maybe do a… Am okay with that? Can I have your approval? It’s Carolina. Beautiful. Over the next four years, we’ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we’ll end our reliance on China. We’ve already started, we’re well on our way. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms.\nDonald Trump: (01:15:45)\nWe will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous, foolish, stupid foreign wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. Already signed, hits in January 1st. Don’t give Biden the credit for it, please. He won’t even know what it is. He’ll say, “What did I do?” And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs at levels that you’ve never seen before. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon in the United States. We’ll be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and it’ll be soon. And NASA is now the number one space center in the world by far. And it was virtually abandoned when I took over. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools.\nDonald Trump: (01:17:13)\nWe will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” And that won’t be changed. They took the word God out of the pledge of allegiance and they got absolutely decimated. They put it back. They said, “No, no we didn’t it.” And then they took it out a couple of other times. That’s the way they’re going, but it’s not going to happen. Not even going to come close. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina.\nDonald Trump: (01:18:12)\nSo again, this is the most important election of our lives, maybe in the history of our country. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get out and vote. The red wave is coming. The red wave is coming. And remember, early voting starts, guess when? Today. So go down there. From Wilmington to Winston-Salem, from Asheville to Charlotte, from Greensboro to right here in Greenville, we inherit the legacy of North Carolina patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We love our nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And you haven’t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, and we are returning it faster than anyone ever thought possible.\nDonald Trump: (01:19:57)\nWith your help, your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We’re proud. We will make America safe again, quickly. And we will make America great again. Thank you everybody. Go out and vote.",

         "Pedro Fuentes Cid: (01:08)\nYeah, my name is Pedro Fuentes Cid. I’m a Cuban ex-political prisoner, and I have here with me Nelly Rojas from [foreign language 00:01:17]. [inaudible 00:01:22] Alvarez [foreign language 00:01:24] Alfredo [inaudible 00:01:33] [foreign language 00:01:38]. First, we want to thank Vice President Pence for allowing us the honor of being here with you. We think that you were one of the wisest decisions that our very wise precedent, Donald Trump, had, and we really are very happy. And not only are we going to make America great again, America is great again because of you guys. It’s great again, and it’s going to continue to be great again. And if you will vote four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Exactly. I want to direct this thought to other ex-political prisoners of communist countries. Watch out communist countries, we don’t want our country to be communist, right? We don’t need it.\nPedro Fuentes Cid: (02:38)\nAnyway, to really, really be behind these candidates that have so much in these four years to make this country great, they have done a lot, and they’re going to do even more. And this year, with a [foreign language 00:02:58], they have shown strength. And Kamala [foreign language 00:03:04] Kamala had a discussion with the vice president, vice president was fantastic. I think he beat her to… finish her off. So, anyway, my last words are going to be in Spanish. Sorry about that. [foreign language 00:03: 25] Mike Pence [foreign language 00:03:34] Trump/Pence. Trump/Pence. Trump/Pence. [foreign language 00: 04:27].\nMike Pence: (04:35)\nThank you so much.\nPedro Fuentes Cid: (05:12)\nYes, sir.\nMike Pence: (05:16)\nI’ll give it to the president today.\nPedro Fuentes Cid: (05:49)\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much.\nMike Pence: (06:02)\nWell, hello Florida. To Lieutenant Governor Nunez, Maria Salazar, Ernesto Ackerman, Bobby [inaudible 00:06:17], all the inspiring three or fighters gathered here today, It is great to be back in the Sunshine State with so many champions for freedom, just 19 days away from a great victory all across Florida and all across America. But standing here, near the hallowed grounds of Memorial Cubano, it is my great honor, on behalf of our president, to accept the endorsement of these extraordinary heroes of the Cuban exiled community. Thank you so much. I thank you so much for the honor and for the support. But honestly, I’m here for one reason and one reason only, and that is that Florida and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Cuatro anos mas. It’s on, and the road to victory runs right through Florida.\nMike Pence: (07:40)\nFour years ago, a movement was born, a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. Here in Florida, you knew we could be strong again. You knew we could be prosperous again. You said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016, and I know that Florida is going to say yes to Florida resident President Donald Trump in 2020. But it really is great to be with all of you and great to be back in Miami. And it’s great to be here with some people I so deeply admire. Would you join me in thanking one of the great great leaders in this state and one of the most admired women in America, Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nunez? Thank you so much. And it’s also great to be here with an award-winning journalist, the daughter of Cuban exiles, someone who’s been a voice for the voiceless all across this hemisphere, and the next Congresswoman from Florida’s 27th Congressional District, let’s hear it from Maria Salazar. We need Maria in Washington DC, and while you’re at it, we need you to send Mayor Carlos Jimenez and the great Mario Diaz-Belart to Washington DC, as well.\nMike Pence: (09:20)\nSo, it really is great to be with all of you. President will be in Miami before the day is over, so we are doubling up on South Florida. But it’s been a busy time. Been traveling around the country. I was in Utah last week. We had a little debate with Kamala Harris. Some people think I did all right. Thank you. But let me be clear, that debate was not just a debate between two candidates for vice president, it was really a debate between two visions: our vision that leads America to freedom, prosperity, and opportunity for all, and their vision that sets America on a path of less opportunity, decline, and a socialist future. When you compare the Biden/Harris agenda with our agenda, the choice is clear. If you cherish faith and freedom and law and order and life, in less than three weeks, we need to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. Cuatro anos mas.\nMike Pence: (10:54)\nIt’s amazing to think how far we’ve come in four years in our stand for freedom, and it all begins with the defense of freedom. Providing for the national defense is the first order of our national government. And I have to tell you, as the proud father of a United States marine and the father-in-law of a United States Navy pilot, currently deployed, I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. President Donald Trump has signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We’ve rebuilt our military, we’ve restored the arsenal democracy, and we’re once again giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guard, the resources and the support that they need. And with that renewed American strength, we’ve stood with our allies and stood up to our enemies, and this president has stood strong for freedom and liberty across this hemisphere of freedom.\nMike Pence: (12:10)\nFrom early on, we’ve stood strong with the freedom-loving people of Columbia, with President Duque, and last month, when a great hero of freedom, former president of Alvaro Uribe was placed in house arrest, President Trump and our administration called on the Colombian judiciary to release this heroic champion of freedom. And earlier this week, we learned that President Uribe is free. And in Nicaragua, we’ve stood strong against Ortega’s regime’s brutalization of its citizens and its systemic and lethal attacks against the Catholic church. We’ve imposed sanctions on all of those who would carry out this abuse. And I promise you under president Donald Trump, we are going to continue to stand firm for free and fair elections in 2021 in Nicaragua.\nMike Pence: (13:22)\nAnd in Venezuela, under president Donald Trump, America has stood against dictatorship and oppression. We have made it clear to this hemisphere and clear to the world. Maduro must go and democracy must be restored. We’ve imposed sanctions on the dictator Maduro, we’ve deployed Navy and Coast Guard ships into the region to interdict in their narcotics traffic. In this past March, we indicted the dictator Maduro and his cronies for their narco-terrorism corruption and drug trafficking. And I couldn’t be more proud that America was the first nation on earth to recognize president Juan Guaidó as the only legitimate president of Venezuela, and now 60 nations around the world have joined us. You know, it’s heartbreaking to think, socialist policies of the Chavez and Maduro regime have caused economic and humanitarian catastrophe in Venezuela, but under president Donald Trump, as I told Juan Guaidó just a few short weeks ago, in America we say to the people of Venezuela, [foreign language 00:01:53] We will not stand by while Venezuela crumbles. We will stand with the people of Venezuela until their birthright of libertad is restored.\nMike Pence: (15:09)\nAnd here, so close to the hallowed ground of Memorial Cubano, erected to remember the victims of the communist regime in Havana, you all know that when Joe Biden was Vice President America appeased the Castro regime with concession after concession. The Obama-Biden administration actually returned a convicted murderer, Gerardo Hernández, and other members of the regime spy network back to Cuba. And when the last president visited Cuba, he literally stood hand in hand with Raul Castro.\nMike Pence: (15:54)\nPresident Trump, he brought eight years of appeasement to an end, and President Donald Trump will only stand hand in hand with you and all of those who cherish freedom in this country and in that beleaguered nation. Under this president’s leadership, we’ve reversed the failed policies of the last administration. We’ve imposed sanctions. We’ve stood with political prisoners and stood for the human rights of the Cuban people. As president Trump said just a few weeks ago, when he accepted for the second election in a row the endorsement of the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association, we will not lift sanctions until all political prisoners are freed, freedoms of assembly and expression are respected, and political parties are legalized with free elections for all the people of Cuba. Standing here in the shadow of Memorial Cubano I promise you four more years of president Donald Trump in the white house. It will always be Que Viva Cuba Libre.\nMike Pence: (17:29)\nSo we’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve stood for freedom, ours, the birthright of freedom across this hemisphere. And in the first three years of this administration, we revived this economy. Where Joe Biden wants to raise taxes, President Trump cut taxes across the board. We rolled back more federal regulation than any administration in history. We unleashed American energy. We fought for free and fair trade, and in just three short years, businesses large and small created more than seven million good paying jobs, including 550,000 jobs right here in Florida.\nMike Pence: (18:13)\nAnd Florida reached its lowest unemployment rate in history. And the average hourly earnings in this state grew faster in our first three years than they did in all eight years when Joe Biden was Vice President. The President and I are probably most proud of the fact that wages were rising across the board, but they were rising most rapidly for hard working blue collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no more.\nMike Pence: (18:45)\nAnd all along the way President Trump has stood for the rule of law. We’ve appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And they’re all men and women who will uphold all the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms. And let me just say, 230 judges strong and pretty soon one more on the Supreme Court.\nMike Pence: (19:24)\nNone of that would have been possible without the strong support of Senator Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio. Would you join me in thanking these two great leaders? Now last month, we paused as a nation to honor the life in service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But when the memorials were over, President Trump fulfilled his duty under the Constitution, and he nominated a principled, brilliant, conservative woman who loves the Constitution to the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Amy Coney Barrett.\nMike Pence: (20:04)\nI’m going to tell her you all did that. I’ll tell you what. Now the President and I called on the Democrats in Washington this time to give Judge Barrett a respectful and dignified confirmation, and we’re going to hold them to it. But we have reason to be concerned. Kamala Harris actually attacked one of our nominees to the federal court because he was a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. And you all remember during Judge Barrett’s confirmation a couple of years ago to the court of appeals, the leading Democrat on the judiciary committee actually said she was concerned, saying that Judge Barrett’s Catholic faith was a quote, “Dogma that lives loudly within you.” And Hollywood elites have already begun to ridicule her faith and family. Well, I got news for the Democrats and their friends in Hollywood. That dogma lives loudly in me. That dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and work and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States of America.\nMike Pence: (21:38)\nSo the Senate has a job to do, and they’re doing it. And after they discharge their duty to advise and consent, I’ll make you a prediction. Judge Amy Coney Barrett is going to be Justice Amy Coney Barrett. We’re going to fill that seat. You know, an independent judiciary is a bulwark of freedom. As we reflect today so much on America’s love and commitment to freedom, people gathered here and all across Florida deserve to know, after 150 years with nine justices on the Supreme Court, leading Democrats in Washington are actually talking about packing the court.\nMike Pence: (22:46)\nJoe Biden refused to answer the question during his presidential debate. And you might’ve seen Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris refused to answer my question during our debate. Although in the primaries, Kamala Harris said that she was quote, “Absolutely open,” to packing the court. It’s true. Last Friday, Joe Biden was actually asked if voters didn’t deserve to know if he plans to pack the court. And he said, and I quote, “No, they don’t.” Well, you know what? When you’re running for the highest office in the land, the American people deserve to know whether you’re going to respect the highest court in the land.\nMike Pence: (23:27)\nIt’s time for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell to come clean, give the people of this country a straight answer. There’s only one explanation why they won’t answer the question. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to pack the Supreme Court with liberal judges if they win. Make no mistake about it though, adding seats to the Supreme Court and filling them with leftist activist judges would be the biggest power grab in American history, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to preserve an independent judiciary. We’re going to uphold the Constitution of the United States. We’re going to reelect president Donald Trump for four more years.\nMike Pence: (24:29)\nSo we’ve stood for the rule of law. We’ve stood for an independent judiciary and conservatives on our court. And President Donald Trump has stood every day with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement. And we always will. The president and I know the men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in this country. When I was growing up my three brothers and I used to travel up to Chicago with mom and dad to visit their families. Dad’s younger brother, still living at home, would come out in the morning wearing that Chicago police department uniform. Sidearms strapped to him. My three brothers and I’d just look up in awe.\nMike Pence: (25:21)\nAll of my heroes wear uniforms. Men and women in law enforcement across this country are heroes. And they deserve the respect of every American every day. Now the president and I will always respect the right of Americans to peaceful protest, it’s enshrined in the Constitution. But rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech. Violence against innocent civilians, the destruction of property, or violence against law enforcement will not be tolerated and those who do it will be…\nMike Pence: (26:03)\n… will not be tolerated, and those who do it will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\nMike Pence: (26:12)\nNow, for months, remember, all summer long, all Joe Biden talked about was peaceful protests, remember? As the American people literally saw businesses and their communities burn on national television. The truth is, Joe Biden would double down on the policies that have led to violence in our major cities. You know, when you withdraw support for those who protect and serve, you only embolden those who would do harm to our families and our communities.\nMike Pence: (26:46)\nNow, Joe Biden explains it all by saying that America is, in his words, systemically racist. Joe Biden said that police officers in this country have a quote, “Implicit bias against minorities.” When Joe Biden was asked, if he would support cutting funding for law enforcement, he said, “Yes, absolutely.” Under President Donald Trump, I’ll make your promise. We’re going to back to blue and we’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever.\nMike Pence: (27:24)\nYou and I know that we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors or any minorities that live within our city. Under President Trump’s leadership. We have done both for three and a half years, and we’re going to support law enforcement and create more jobs, better education opportunities, and more prosperity for our African-Americans and all of our minorities in this country. We’re going to do both, and we’re going to have law and order in every city for every American of every race and creed and collar. So help us God.\nMike Pence: (28:23)\nSo we’ve stood for the rule of law. We stood for law and order. From the first day of this administration, this president is also stood strong for the right of every American to live, to work, to worship, according to the dictates of your conscience and your faith. You know, when Joe Biden was vice president, we saw a steady assault on the religious freedom of the American people. It’s true. It was President Trump who restored the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and teachers and religious charities. It was President Donald Trump who ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor, and the Supreme Court made it permanent by a seven to two vote.\nMike Pence: (29:08)\nNow, Joe Biden is actually said that he intends to haul those nuns back into federal court. Can you imagine that? I mean, I’m the product of eight years of Catholic education. My love, and my respect for nuns is boundless. Anybody with me?\nMike Pence: (29:36)\nSo here you have the Little Sisters of the Poor who have taken a vow of poverty to dedicate their lives to helping the underserved community, and in the Obama Biden administration, they hauled him into federal court to force them to compromise their faith. Joe Biden actually pledged, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, to do it again, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to reelect President Donald Trump because people of faith have no greater champion than President Donald Trump.\nMike Pence: (30:14)\nMaybe most important of all is we talk about Liberty. We need to talk about life. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. They want to increase funding to the largest abortion provider in America, and provide taxpayer funding to promote and provide abortion around the world. President Donald Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history.\nMike Pence: (30:55)\nSo we’ve rebuilt our military, revived our economy, stood for law and order, liberties and life. None of that would’ve been possible without the strong and consistent support of Florida’s Republican delegation in Congress. That’s why right after you reelect President Donald Trump for four more years, we need Florida to send Maria Salazar, Mayor Carlos Gimenez, Mario Díaz-Balart to a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives and retire Nancy Pelosi once and for all.\nMike Pence: (31:34)\nWhen you look at what we were able to accomplish with a Republican house and Republican Senate in those first few years, there’s only one conclusion you can draw, with this president’s and your support here in Florida, in three short years, we made America great again. We did. You said it.\nMike Pence: (32:11)\nThen earlier this year, the coronavirus struck from China. But I’m here to tell you, when there were only five cases of coronavirus in the United States, and all of them had come back from overseas, President Trump did what no American president had ever done, he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world.\nMike Pence: (32:39)\nJoe Biden called that hysterical. He said it was xenophobic. He actually wrote that it would make things worse if we closed our border to China. But I can tell you as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, President Trump’s actions saved untold American lives, and it bought us time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II.\nMike Pence: (33:06)\nIt’s true. We reinvented testing. We’ve done more than 120 million tests so far. We saw to the manufacture and delivery of literally billions of medical supplies to our doctors and nurses and healthcare workers. We’re developing medicines that are literally saving lives around America and we are just a few weeks away, I believe, from having the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine, and having millions of doses for the American people.\nMike Pence: (33:38)\nAs I said, the president is going to be in Miami later today, and I’m happy to report, the president, and the first lady, and Baron are all doing great and he is back. Back on the road. Back in the fight.\nMike Pence: (33:55)\nBut, let me take this opportunity to say on behalf of the president, and the first family, how moved we all were by the outpouring of concern and prayers for them. But as the president observed, we know it was just an example of the love and the care and the concern that’s shown for every American family that suffered loss or struggled in the midst of this global pandemic.\nMike Pence: (34:22)\nIn fact, let’s just take a moment. Can we just show our appreciation for our doctors, our nurses, our first responders, all those in ministry who have come alongside those who’ve struggled and suffered loss over these past eight months? They are heroes all. Heroes all.\nMike Pence: (34:47)\nSo we’re making sure our doctors and nurses have everything they need. The American people have the council to slow the spread, just like y’all did here in Florida this summer. We’re going to protect the vulnerable. We’re going to save lives. With Joe Biden talking about shutting down our economy, under President Trump, we’re opening up America again.\nMike Pence: (35:12)\nIn the last five months, after losing 22 million jobs as the height of this pandemic, we’ve already seen 11 and a half million Americans go back to work, including more than 630,000 people back on the job right here in Florida.\nMike Pence: (35:29)\nSo we’re opening up America and we are opening up America’s schools. We just announced a few weeks back, we’re distributing a hundred million rapid tests to school nurses and administrators all across America, making it impossible that everywhere in this country, we can get our kids back in the classroom where they belong and keep them there safe and sound. So we’ve gone through a time of testing. But in just 19 days, we’re coming to a time for choosing, and the choice and this election has never been clearer. The stakes have never been higher. It’s amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. President Trump, we not only cut taxes across the board for businesses and families, but we’re going to keep cutting taxes for four more years.\nMike Pence: (36:37)\nJoe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape. The president had to remind him, in that presidential debate, that he supports the green new deal. It seemed like he forgot. He wants to put us back into the Paris Climate Accord. President Trump, we cut federal red tape, our air and land and water are the cleanest in history, and we’re also a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years.\nMike Pence: (37:08)\nWhen it comes to trade, the contrast couldn’t be clearer. When we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China. $500 billion a year we were losing to China. Joe Biden’s been a cheerleader for communist China all along the way. President Trump, he put China on notice. He said, “The era of economic surrender is over.” We imposed tariffs and we’re going to stand strong with China until they respect American workers and American property.\nMike Pence: (37:52)\nAnd you all remember NAFTA, signed in 1995. Where I come from up in the Heartland, we literally saw entire communities shuttered as factories closed, as jobs move South of the border and overseas. It’s true. 60,000 factories were closed in all the years since NAFTA. The last administration was about to give up on manufacturing, remember? They said, “What magic wand do you have?” Well, we didn’t need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. NAFTA is gone, the USMCA is here to stay, and it’s a win for Florida. It’s a win for Florida workers and Florida agriculture. It’s amazing.\nMike Pence: (38:44)\nThe people of Florida deserved to know that Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, actually was one of only 10 senators to vote against the USMCA. Even though it was a huge win for agriculture in this state, and a huge win for manufacturing. Kamala Harris said, “The USMCA didn’t go far enough on climate change.”\nMike Pence: (39:02)\n… USMCA didn’t go far enough on climate change. She actually put her radical environmental agenda ahead of American jobs and Florida jobs. And I promise you, with four more years of President Donald Trump, we’re always going to put American jobs and American workers first. When you look at their agenda, it’s clear. Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left.\nMike Pence: (39:34)\nNow, Joe Biden says that democracy is on the ballot, whatever that means. I think our economic recovery is on the ballot. Law and order are on the ballot. I think all the freedom loving people gathered here and your families know that there are things much more foundational and much more fundamental that are on the ballot. In this election, I think it’s not going to be so much whether America ends up more Republican or more Democrat, more conservative or more liberal, more red or more blue. I think the choice in this election is whether America remains American. It’s whether we’re going to allow Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the Democratic party to steer us on a path forged by the radical left toward more government, less freedom, and an inexorable path to socialism, whether we’re going to renew our commitment to all the ideals that have made this country great, of freedom and personal responsibility.\nMike Pence: (40:53)\nIt’s a choice so many families in this community understand better than most Americans. Many of your families in generations past actually fled tyrannies, like communist Cuba, socialist Venezuela, come to this land of freedom. You’ve heard tale, and some of you have seen the aftermath of the empty lives of those who would promise a free lunch, who would advance more government and less freedom. You’ve seen the end of the road where the leftist want to take us in America. And you also know the price that the heroes remembered at Memorial Cubana paid to stand for freedom.\nMike Pence: (41:39)\nIt’s humbling for me to stand here today with this grand memorial behind me, to think of heroes like Carlos Costa and Mario de la Pena. They were called brothers to the rescue in 1996. They loved freedom so much. They flew missions attempting to locate Cuban refugees who were trying to escape communist tyranny of Castro so they could drop relief supplies on them and radio their position to the coast guard. But you all know the story. Their mission of mercy was cut short when they were shut down over international waters by Cuban fighter jets. They were sons of Cuba. They were patriotic Americans and we rightly honor their memory in name and in deed.\nMike Pence: (42:43)\nWe’re inspired by their example, by what they were willing to do to advance the freedom in this nation and in this hemisphere in their time. We know they were driven by love for their families. We know they were driven by a love for freedom. And as a great Cuban American who fled Cuba as a child said at the Republican National Convention, and I quote Maximo said, “Right now, it’s up to us to decide our fate and to choose freedom over oppression.” He said, rightly, “You and I will decide.” But then he said, “Here’s what I’ve decided.” He said, “I choose President Trump because I choose America. I choose President Trump because I choose freedom.” So for our freedom and for our future, we need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States. We’re going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. I want to thank you all for coming out today. And I want to thank you for the honor of serving as your vice president these last four years, the greatest honor in my life. And I’ve served alongside this president every day the last four years. I really didn’t know the Florida resident who became our president until he asked me to join the ticket. Some people think we’re a little different, but actually we’ve gotten to be very close friends. And I can tell you, I can tell you firsthand, there’s not a day gone by that President Trump hasn’t gotten up, turned his face like flint against the wind of unprecedented opposition and fought to keep the promises that he made to the American people. Now it’s our turn to fight for him. It’s on, Florida. We got to make it happen. Going to take all of us.\nMike Pence: (45:24)\nSo before I leave, I want to ask you to do a couple of things. First, before these 19 days are out, I need you to vote, Florida. I need you to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. I checked on the way here. Early voting starts Monday, October 19th. And remember, you take advantage of early voting, friends don’t let friends vote alone. Bring a family member, bring a friend, bring a neighbor, and cast a vote for four more years.\nMike Pence: (46:04)\nAnd secondly, after you’re done voting, I need you to keep on doing what you’re doing right now. Bring this incredible enthusiasm. Wear the hat, wear the shirt. Tell the story. Tell people, “I ran into Mike the other day out in the field, out on the fairgrounds. And he stood out there for like an hour, just giving us the top lines of everything we’ve been able to accomplish and all that we can do and the choice in this election.” I want you to talk to your neighbors and friends at work and worship every day. And when you do it, I encourage you to have faith. Have faith in the American people. I really do believe that a careful study of American history proves that every time the American people have been given a clear choice between a future built on freedom and a future built on less freedom, they choose freedom every single time. So go tell your neighbors and friends that freedom’s on the ballot on November the third.\nMike Pence: (47:11)\nAnd lastly, I’d encourage you to have that other kind of faith as well. At the end of the vice presidential debate, I got a question from a little girl. She said that when she was watching television, it seemed like people arguing all the time, she wondered how we could bring our country back together. But as I’ve traveled across this country these last four years, I’ve become convinced that there will always be more that unites us in these United States than could ever divide us. And chief among those things is faith. It’s true. So if you’re of a mind to bow the head and bend the knee in the next 19 days, I encourage you to do that too.\nMike Pence: (47:58)\nAnd when you pray, pray with confidence, mindful of those ancient words, that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray, in turn he’ll do like he’s always done in the long and storied history of this nation. He’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land, this one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America. Pray for all of the American people. It’ll make a difference.\nMike Pence: (48:49)\nMen and women of Florida, time’s a wasting. You still got the better part of the rest of the day. Get out and tell the story. And I leave here today encouraged. I just know that if all of us do all that we need to do across the sunshine state and all across this country in every hour that remains between now and election day, we’re going to have a great victory all across Florida and all across America. We’re going to make Florida and America stronger than ever before. We’re going to make Florida and America safer than ever before. We’re going to make Florida and America more prosperous than you could possibly imagine. And with Rick Scott and Marco Rubio in a renewed Republican majority in the Senate, with Maria Salazar, Carlos Gimenez, Mario Diaz-Balart in a new Republican majority in the House with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years and with God’s help, we will make America great again. Again. Thank you all very much. God bless you. God bless America. Let’s go get it done.",

         "President Donald J. Trump: (14:59)\nThank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello, Des Moines. Oh, it’s been a good time we’ve had in Des Moines. I even brought a hat. They said, “Sir, it is so windy out there.” I said, “Well, my hair is very powerful. It’s very strong. It can handle it.” But I bought it just in case. It may get pretty bad. But it’s pretty windy. So thank you all very much. And I’m thrilled to be back in the American Heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking Iowa patriots. And 20 days from now, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re going to keep it going.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:54)\nAnd I must tell you, I’ve just looked. The poll just came out. We’re up six. Okay. Big deal. Didn’t we win by 11 or something. We’re up six. And if I’m up six, nobody has ever done for Iowa and the farm belt and the farmers and all, no more estate taxes, no more anything. I saved ethanol. Ethanol is saved. For me to only be up six, I’m a little bit concerned. I’ll tell you that. There’s nobody’s going to do for Iowa what I did for Iowa. We’ve just learned through, explosive documents, published by a very fine newspaper, The New York Post, that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (16:44)\nAnd this is a big smoking gun. The newly uncovered emails reveal that a top executive from the highly questionable Ukrainian company, it’s an energy company which paid Hunter at least $50,000 a month, but it’s now looking like it could be $183,000 a month. That’s a lot of money. Would anybody in this audience take it? I’ll take it. We’ll take it. Despite the fact that he had absolutely no experience, knew nothing about energy, wrote to Hunter arranging for a meeting to meet with Vice President Joe Biden. I’ve been saying this for a long time with that family. The same Ukrainian energy executive even sent Hunter an email saying, “We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence.”\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (17:37)\nIn other words, Hunter was being paid for access to his Vice President father, who was specifically put in charge of Ukraine and Russia. How about the Russia hoax? It turned out that they were the ones that did the Russia hoax. It was them. No collusion. No collusion. These emails show that Biden’s repeated claim that he has never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings were a complete lie. It was a total lie. He lied to you over and over because he’s trying to cover up a massive pay for play scandal at the heart of his vice presidency. And everybody knows it. Everybody in Washington knows it. We’ve known it for a long time. The fact is there was never an administration more corrupt than the Obama Biden administration. There was never. Never.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (18:39)\nJust weeks ago, Joe stood before the American people in a presidential debate and told you that these claims had been totally discredited and that his son did nothing wrong. But now that turns out to be a total lie. Now we can see clearly that Biden is a corrupt politician who shouldn’t even be allowed to run for the presidency. I was pressing Joe Biden to tell the truth because the corrupt lame stream media, right back there, all those cameras right back there, they’re corrupt. And they refuse to write the story. There wasn’t one time in almost four years during my presidency, during the greatest political scandal in U.S. history, a witch hunt, a horrible, horrible, disgusting witch hunt that should never, ever happen to another presidency again, and people should pay for the crimes they committed.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (19:46)\nWhich turned out to me at total illegal hoax that false and libelous stories every day, false and libelous stories, and they knew they were false, too. They knew they were false. They were never taken down by Twitter or Facebook or the mainstream media. Never once. Yet with Biden today, they take negative posts down almost before they even go up. They’re trying to protect them. They’re trying to protect Biden. They take them down. And I was just getting off that magnificent plane behind us, Air Force One. And I had heard, and I just don’t know this for a fact, but they say Kayleigh McEnany, you know Kayleigh, right? Kayleigh McEnany. Good Kayleigh. She’s so great. She’s incredible. They closed down her account. She’s the White House Press Secretary. Because she’s reporting the truth, they closed down her account. So let’s see what’s going to happen.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (20:52)\nAnd did you hear the news? Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. Bruce Ohr. Him and his wonderful wife, Molly. She wrote all this stuff. And then he goes and he works at Department of Justice and he took it, didn’t he bring it to the FBI? The wife writes that she gets paid a lot of money. Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. That’s good. Couple of years too late, that’s all. He should be not only in the Department of Justice outbox, he should be someplace else, okay?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:27)\nEight months after his alleged meeting with the Burisma executives. So these Burisma, Burisma, they say, pronounce it Burisma, a real beautiful company, Vice President Joe Biden went to Ukraine and threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid if they did not fire the prosecutor that was investigating his son and the company that his son worked for. That’s Burisma. The documents also show that before one of Joe’s trips to Ukraine, Hunter emailed his business partner saying his lucrative contract should begin now. Think of that. Should begin now, right now. It’s got to begin. The whole thing is so incredible. Here’s a guy, look, let’s just put it in simple language. He got thrown out of the military. That’s unfortunate. He didn’t have a job for a long time. His father becomes Vice President, and he’s making millions and millions and millions of dollars a year. Think of it. No, think of it. Think of it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:43)\nIt’s like the Hillary stuff, the crooked Hillary. And it’s the crooked Joe. You know, when a Democrat voter here in Iowa asked Joe last year, you remember, if his son raked in money in exchange for providing access, Joe pulled that man a damn liar. “You’re a damn liar.” Kid’s making millions of dollars. He had nothing. He didn’t have a job. Thrown out of the military, sadly, but thrown out of the military. And he knew nothing about energy. He knew nothing about investments. Knew nothing about China. How about he walked away a billion and a half dollars to manage for China? They don’t do that with the most brilliant people on Wall Street.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:25)\nVice President Biden, you owe the people of America and apology because it turns out you are a corrupt politician. Okay? Joe Biden must immediately release all emails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts, and records related to his involvement in his family’s business dealings, influence panelings around the world, including China and including Russia, including Russia. Hunter raked in a fortune from China while Joe Biden was giving China all of our jobs. We know where they came from, Iowa and plenty of other places, but they came from Iowa. He was giving them. They were taking our jobs. They were taking our factories. They were taking everything. They were taking our wealth. And I gave you $28 billion. Say, “Thank you very much, President Xi.” It came right out of China. And because of that, everybody’s happy in Iowa. I just hope you remember that on November 3rd. Hope you remember. Nobody else would have done it. Nobody else would have done it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:42)\nThe Biden family treated the vice presidency as a for-profit corporation, flying around the globe, collecting millions of dollars from China and Ukraine and Russia and other countries. In fact, the wife of the mayor of Moscow gave Hunter Biden a check for $3.5 million in cash while his father gave away the store to Russia, including Crimea. Remember Crimea? The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. By contrast, and this is so true and so easily true, and I’m so proud of it in so many ways, I’d given up billions of dollars to serve as your President and it’s my greatest honor of a lifetime. It’s so true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (25:51)\nWhere’s my hat?\nAudience: (25:51)\nFour more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (25:57)\nI ran for President because I could not sit back any longer and watch the terrible injustices being done to the American people. And it’s true. And by the way, before the China plague came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now it’s going right back there. Our stock market is very close to a number that was even higher. Does everybody have your 401k ready? Because it’s going through the roof. We’re going to have the best year we’ve ever had, and we’re going to have tax cuts not tax increases. They want to increase your taxes. They want to increase your taxes so they can spend it on the green new deal. That’s another beauty.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (26:44)\nI can not sit idly by and watch career politicians like Joe Biden continue bleeding this country dry. And that’s what it is. You know, you can say whatever you want. You can say whatever you want, but when you have a kid that follows his father, and by the way, take a look at his brother, his brother, all of-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (27:03)\n… who is his father? And by the way, take a look at his brother. His brother, all of a sudden is building a big housing development in Iraq. “Have you ever built a development before?” “No, I haven’t.” Take a look at the whole family, it’s a corrupt family. Joe Biden, personifies the selfless and corrupt globalist who got rich and powerful at your expense. Take a look at the people that are funding his campaign, people assumed that they’d be funding my campaign, I don’t want them, we don’t want them, we never needed them, we don’t want them. But they betrayed American workers, disparaged American values and crushed our middle-class. For decades, Biden and his cronies laughed while they shipped millions of your jobs to their friends in foreign countries, in countries that you’ve never even heard of. They live behind gated walls and they flooded your communities with illegal immigration, deadly drugs, MS-13 savages that assault, rape, and murder innocent Americans.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (28:05)\nThey forced our fellow citizens to live in crumbling inner cities while they spent trillions of dollars on never ending foreign wars, they just never ended, but we’re bringing all our soldiers back home, you know that, we’ve been doing it for a long time. And it’s not easy, the military industrial complex, not the easiest thing, but we’re bringing them back home. We’re almost finished in Afghanistan, coming in, we’re dealing… We’re down to a small number coming home by the end of the year, hopefully the end of the year, shortly thereafter. In Syria, we’re out, totally out. And by the way, we crushed, before I did this, we crushed 100% of the ISIS caliphate, 100%, we crushed 100%. We have the greatest military in the world, and by the way, we have built the greatest military in the world.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (29:10)\nSo, I just tell you from Iowa, you’re a very powerful state, politically, you’re a big state to me, big in your heart, but you have a tremendous influence and a tremendous power and you’ve never let me down, you just came in and we won by so much. They say if a Republican wins by one point… I think I won by 11, right? 11. That was early in the night, remember that? They said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Iowa.” Then they said, “Man, he went by 11 points, what’s going on?” That was just the beginning. Then we won Ohio, we won Ohio by eight points, I said, “What’s going on?” It’s one thing you want to say, but when you wouldn’t buy a lot, and that was the beginning of something. And I’ll tell you what, we have more enthusiasm now than we ever did four years ago, that really is true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (30:11)\nAnd we have great poll numbers, although you see a lot of the fake poll numbers they’ll do anything they can to call suppression pools. There they go. Look at the red lights, they start to go off as I start to put… In one way they want the ratings, in another way they don’t want to have the ratings and you’re telling CNN that they’re a fraud in their broadcasting. That was one of the greatest evenings ever. There were those who say it was the most exciting evening in the history of television, highest rated evening in the history of television. And, you know what? The election we have coming up on November 3rd is actually more important. In 2016, you voted to fire the failed and decrepit political class and you elected an outsider as your president, and I finally put America first, it’s called Make America Great Again.\nCrowd: (31:15)\nFour more years. USA.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (31:28)\nIt’s windy out here. If you can wear the hat, I can wear the hat. Should I take off the tie or not? What do you think? I don’t know. Maybe, yes?\nCrowd: (31:55)\n[crosstalk 00:31:46].\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (32:09)\nOh, that feels so much better, that feels better, that feels good. Now, we can all just relax and have a good time. No, but it’s great to be with you. Seriously, we’ve had a great history here together, what we’ve done for you, and what we’ve done for the farmers, and what we’ve done for everything. Two weeks ago, you had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, right? Two weeks ago, you had the largest order of soybeans in the history of our country, and the largest order of beef, but you know why? Because China wants to keep me happy, that’s why. It was from China, because they know what they’ve done to us should never have been allowed. They could have stopped it, they didn’t stop it, they should have stopped it. The only reason I’m your president is because the previous administration did a poor job, so poor, in fact, that I said, “I’m going to run for president.”\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (33:14)\nAnd you know what? If they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. And if they did a good job, I guess, I wouldn’t have won, when you think, I wouldn’t have run and I wouldn’t have won. But they were so bad, and it turns out there was so totally corrupt. We did not come this far to overcome this much and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the deprived Washington swamp.\nCrowd: (33:45)\nUSA.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (33:45)\nWhen I would say, “Drain the swamp,” I used to say it, “Drain the swamp,” and people liked it, I hated the expression, I hated it. I just said, “This is a hokey expression.” And I put it on one speech the place went crazy, I said, “I’m starting to like that expression.” Then I put it in another speech and they went crazy, I said, “I really like it.” But when I said drain the swamp, I had no idea the swamp was that dirty, that disgusting, and that deep, it’s true. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician, thank God. And I don’t want to insult our great politicians because you have some great ones with us tonight. But if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than… And I’ll tell you what, I fight for you harder than any president has ever fought for anyone, it’s not easy. But I love it because we’re making tremendous progress.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (34:59)\nAnd the fact is that, no administration in their first three and a half years has ever done as much as this administration has done, you take a look at the last ones. And it’s amazing because they challenge you on everything, they never even challenge me on that statement. I make that statement all the time, they just stand there and they say, “[inaudible 00:35:23].” They grit their, they say, “He’s right.” “We might hate him, but,” they say, “he’s right.” Right now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy, and save our country from the radical left, and that’s exactly what we’re doing. As a candidate, Joe Biden has made yet another corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control to the socialists, and Marxists, and the lunatic left-wing fringe that are really running that party, he’s not running it. Let’s face it, Joe is shot, okay? Whether you like it or not. We can all be nice. It’s going to be my turn someday, it’s even going to be your turn someday, my friends, someday. But you know when it is your turn, you can’t be president.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (36:13)\nOne thing I’ve learned, President Xi of China, he’s a 100%, Putin of Russia, 100%, Kim Jong-un… By the way, whatever happened to that war we were supposed to be in? Kim Jong-un of North Korea, 100%. These people are sharp and they’re smart, Joe has lost it. In his best day, he wasn’t a smart man, everybody he knows that. But Joe has gone. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country, they’re addicted to power, and God help us if they get it. We’ll never be the same country and we will never be able to recover. And we are on a basis… And I’ll tell you something, the country was coming together. I was telling a very, very, actually a very good reporter today, that our country was coming together because we were having such success that I was being called by people that normally I wouldn’t be speaking to too much, they don’t want me, I don’t want them.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (37:14)\nBut we had the best employment numbers in history, African-American, Hispanic American numbers, women, Asian, everything, high school diploma, without high school diploma, colleges, PhDs, we had the best numbers in every category, 160 million jobs, we were never even close to that, we were at 160 million jobs. And it was all coming together, people let’s get together, let’s talk. It’s like splitting up the riches, really, and in a positive way, splitting up the riches. And what happened is, we then got hit with the plague and now it’s back to the drawing boards, but we’re going to have a strong V the quarter, the third quarter is going to be incredible when you see the numbers. Not that I know anything, because I don’t want to give you inside information because I don’t have it. They’ll say, “He’s giving away inside information,” they are sick. But wait till you see the third quarter numbers, and it’s going to be right before the election, before the November 3rd, although a lot of people will have voted by that time, get out and vote, you got to get out and vote.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (38:21)\nBut we were really coming together because that’s… Look, ultimately, we want to come together, everybody come together. And we were really coming together and then we got hit by this horrible situation, could have been stopped. China stopped it from going into the rest of China, but they didn’t stop it from coming out and going to Europe, and the United States, and the rest of the world, 188 countries. So, we’re now putting it together. We had it done and now we’re doing it again, and next year will be even stronger than last year. Last year was the best year we’ve ever had, and this coming year will be even better than last year. Unless somebody comes along and says, “Let’s quadruple your taxes,” which is what they want to do. They want to raise your taxes. They want to go with this ridiculous Green New Deal, which by the way, their original price, a hundred trillion, you couldn’t do it for that. If we did great every year for a hundred years, everything was perfect, right? No nothing, no recessions, no anything, you couldn’t make a hundred trillion dollars. These people are crazy, and they actually mean it. So, we’re going to get it going to a level that nobody can ever turn course on us, nobody can ever change. I tell the story for years as a student of economies, I just love it, I love watching it, I love doing it, and I love seeing the results because the results have been so incredible. But as a student, I used to hear for years, for 10 years, 2019 China… Because look, let’s face it, China is 1.4 billion people, we’re 325, not including illegal immigrants that are in the country, frankly. And we don’t even know what that number… I said, “How many do we have?” “We have no idea, sir.” Well, I have an idea… By the way, our Southern border is now stronger than it’s ever been. But we have 325, 330 million people. But for years I heard that China will overtake us as the world’s largest economy in the year 2019, you’ve all heard it, I think, right? Yes? He’s a very smart looking guy, you’re loaded with money, I bet, look, that’s why he’s in the front row.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (40:40)\nHe’s in the front row and he didn’t have to stand there for three days to get there, I could tell this guy. But, right? 2019 that China was going to overtake. Well, you go back six months, seven months, not only weren’t they overtaking we were beating them by leaps and bounds and getting bigger and bigger, and growing and growing, and taxing them and taxing them, and taking in billions and billions in tariffs. And when they targeted Iowa and the farmers of this country, and ranchers, and others, I said, “No, you can’t do that, no, you can’t.” And I put a 25% tariff on everything and I gave a lot of the money… I don’t want to say it too loudly, 28 billion, I gave you 16 and 12. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, loves… He knows more about farms. I said, “Sonny, what’s the number?” He said, “Two years ago, sir, 12 billion they hit us 4. And last year, 16 billion.”\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (41:35)\nI said, “That’s okay. We’re going to put a 25% tariff, the farmers are going to get 12 billion and then they’re going to get 16 billion, okay? And we’re going to give that money to our farmers.” And that got our farmers even. In fact, I shouldn’t tell you this because they don’t like this, but some of the farmers were making more money the way that Iowa was doing than by working their asses off, all right? They were very, very happy. But no, we took care of our farmers, no other president is going to do that. No other… That’s why China got away with all of these stuff for years. And we had plenty of money left over after the $28 billion, it went into the US treasury. But they got away with it because they had threatened a president like Obama, we’re going to target your farmers, we’re going to target the middle of our country, and Obama would say, “We better not get involved.” I said differently.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (42:29)\nI said, “If you do it then what we’re going to do is we’re going to tariff your goods away, give a lot of that money to the people that you’re targeting.” And the thing that most impresses me about Iowa, Nebraska, and a lot of other States, if you look… By the way, Minnesota was so great, all of them, every one of them, Wisconsin was incredible. They never came to me and said, “Sir, you can’t let this happen. They’ll stop re-ordering, they’re not ordering from us.” They never said it. You know what they said, “The president is right, at some point we have to put up a stand.” And I didn’t hear one even from fake CNN, they put people on television that said, “I know it’s not good, but the president is right.” You did the right thing. Because otherwise, it puts me in a bad negotiating position, you can’t really negotiate, it’s tough. I’ll never forget that about the farmers, it’s incredible. The other thing I won’t forget… You don’t mind if I go off script, this stuff is…\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (43:36)\nEnough with crazy Hunter Biden and making millions of dollars a day, he made it because of his great intellect. No, but you know the other thing… Where’s Hunter? Is Hunter here tonight, by the way? Hunter, congratulations on making a lot of money last year. The other thing I remember in the White House, we had 36 farmers come to see me, I’ll never forget it. And they were getting hit really hard, this was two and a half years ago, early. And they came in to see me, almost all farmers, and they said, “Sir, we’re hurting, but you’re doing the right thing, sir.” I’ll never forget this meeting, it’s early… I’ve pictures of it. Many from Iowa, but from other states, but many from Iowa. And I never saw… Because everyone’s always asking me for money, “I want money here. I want… Countries want money.” Our so-called allies are always asking for money, ” Please defend us.” Even though… And then they rip us off on trade. We defend them and then they rip us off in trade, they’re always asking for money.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (44:37)\nSo, the farmers are in, and I said to them, “You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to do a big thing, I’m going to get you a lot of money and I’m going to do for tariffs, and I’m going to do this to…” This is very early on in the strategy. “And I’m going to subsidize you guys, you’re going to be so happy.” And I used a terrible word. They said, “Sir, may I speak?” “Yes, you can. What do you want to say?” “We don’t want subsidy, sir. All we want is a level playing field, we don’t want anything. All we want…” It’s true, right? It’s true. I never heard that. Most people, they don’t care, call it subsidy, call it, give me cash, just give me money, the farmer said, “We…” And by the way, I could see there was a chill in the room when I mentioned that word. I said, “Did I say something wrong?” The farmers are unbelievable, they’re the heart of this nation. They said, “We don’t want subsidy.” I’ll never forget it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (45:36)\n“Sir, we don’t want subsidy, we don’t want that. We just want a level playing field, sir. We’ll beat anybody. We want a level…” And it’s to this day… I tell that story all the time, because I don’t hear that, most people they don’t care you can call it anything you want, you call subsidy, you call it anything you want. I just think you people are incredible, okay? That’s it. Enough of that or I’m going to make him cry, and he hasn’t tried in 40 years, that guy. One of the most important issues for Iowa is the whole thing that happened with ethanol, they were killing ethanol, and Joe Biden has vowed to abolish fossil fuels, he supports all of the outside… This crusade to eliminate gas powered cars, and his running mate sponsors the insane… She’s the most liberal… By the way, did Mike Pence beat her [inaudible 00:46:36]? The expression in boxing or as my friend, Dana would say, UFC, if that were a fight, they would have stopped it, right? We love Mike Pence and he loves Iowa too, he loves Iowa, he just left. The Biden-Harris platform will demolish Iowa ethanol, you know that, wiping out the entire industry. And we fought hard for it, we went through the whole thing where we had no demand because of the pandemic and we all fought hard to keep it going and keep the ethanol going. And we did the 12 months… I did 12 months, remember it was eight months, I said, “Why not 12?” And they couldn’t give me a very good answer. But I made it year round and 15%, right? Up from the 10, 15%, and it’s great stuff. And when the market comes back, which is coming back, but in the meantime you have inexpensive gasoline, that’s not so bad, right? There’s nobody who ever thought they’d see gasoline with a two in the front of it and less, and we’ve saved all of our energy jobs.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (47:46)\nAnd whether we like it or not, when we are having problem with energy, I called Russia, and I called Saudi Arabia, and they reduced production by more than 10 million barrels a day and our entire energy was saved all over the world, frankly, they’re not doing it for us, but they’re doing it for, let’s say, everybody. And we have an incredible country and we saved our energy industry, our energy jobs, and we are energy independent, and it’s a beautiful thing. And by the way, I also made a little promise most of you won’t understand, for those people in the ethanol world, you can use the pumps, okay? Do you understand that? You can use the pumps. In other words, you don’t have to go out and spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new pumps. Because with the additional ethanol, the additional power, some people say, “Oh, make them buy new pumps.” No, I don’t want you to buy new pumps, you don’t have to.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (48:42)\nSo, for those people that understood what I just said, you know what I’m talking about, right? Using the pumps, that’ll be okay. To defend our rights in our constitution, I nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Right? And I’ll tell you, I don’t mind running against sleepy Joe, but I wouldn’t want to run against her right now. She has to promise… Please promise me, Amy, you’ll never run. Now, she’s been great, she’s so outsmarting these people with bad intention. You look at some of the questions that are being asked and you… It’s so obvious, these are not great chess players. Let’s face it, they’re not great, but they’re horrible, just horrible, nasty, and she handles it like nothing. She’s a great intellect. And one of the reasons she is a highly respected professor who’s been teaching for many years, I said she was the single greatest student that he’s ever had, and that sold me. I believe in that kind of thing, it’s called intelligence, I believe in intelligence. But I just want to… I haven’t spoken to her in a few days, I want to just say that we made the right choice, right? With Amy. And speaking about making the right choice, you made the right choice a long time ago with a man named Senator Chuck Grassley. And you made the right choice and you’re going to do it again, I hope, because she’s great, Joni Ernst. And they’re right now in Washington fighting to confirm our great new justice, our future justice of the United States Supreme Court. Joni has been fantastic and she’s been for Iowa values for a long time. She’ll call me, “Sir, can we do this?” Nobody called me more on ethanol than Joni and Chuck. In fact, I used to duck their calls, “Just tell him I’m not in. I can’t take it anymore, Joni.” But that’s what a good Senator is, they want to keep your state going, they want to keep our country going, they love our country, they love our state that they represent.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (51:11)\nSo, Joni Ernst, you got to get her in. And Chuck Grassley, we don’t have to worry about him, he’ll be around forever, he’s great. You know what I love about Chuck Grassley? He’s got that voice, that great voice. Even when he’s being nice, he sounds like the toughest guy, right? And he’s being nice. And he looked at Comey, remember? The corrupt FBI director.\nSpeaker 1: (51:34)\nLock him up.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (51:34)\nAnd he looks at Comey, corrupt guy, and he just said, “Did you leak?” And Comey joked, “Yes, I did.” He said in the House, and let’s see what happens to him. But I’ll never forget Chuck Grassley, and he didn’t mean it to be mean, he just sort of got that rough voice. “Did you leak?” “What? Yes, I gave it to my college professor friend from Columbia.” Remember that? We love Chuck, what a piece of work he is. If Democrats win, they will pack the Supreme Court with radical left judges who will shred our second amendment. And believe me, if they win, your second amendment is gone, okay? They’ll empower violent mobs and shield deadly criminals and terrorists, it’s very simple. Joe Biden refuses to even answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. How about this? They go up to him, “Do you want to pack the court?” “I’m not going to answer that question.” You know why? Because they don’t ask it if he doesn’t… Me, it would be like… Forget it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (52:46)\nBut they say, “Are you going to pack the court, sir?” “I’m not going to answer that because I don’t want to say.” “Oh, okay, good. Next question.” No, can you believe it? This is the essence of our country, we can’t allow this to happen. And the other thing is, they don’t ask the second. I put up a list of 45, great, brilliant conservative, in our case, justices that go by the constitution as written et cetera, okay? So… He’s got to put up the name of justices or judges, whoever he’d pick to become a justice of the Supreme Court, he’s not doing that, they’re not asking that question, they don’t ask. Did you see the NBC thing last week where they had an NBC town hall? It was designed for a child, okay? When I get in, they ask me things that nobody ever even contemplated could be thought of. This guy, they’re asking him these questions, nobody can believe it. In fact, NBC took a lot of heat, they took a lot of heat.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (53:48)\nBiden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for Iowa seniors, everybody knows that. For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare, do you remember that? You do know he wanted to cut your social security and your Medicare. Now, Biden…\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (54:03)\n… cut your social security and your Medicare. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security. And the problem is we all have a heart. I say it all the time. I’d love to take care of everybody all over the world. The problem is our country can’t afford it. And if you start saying we’re going to give free education. We’re going to give you Medicare. We’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you everything. Our country will be flooded with millions and millions of people that are going to come from all over the world. They will decimate our country.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (54:35)\nYou can’t do it. Biden cares more about illegal aliens that he does for your senior citizens. It’s true. I remember when they asked the question at the debate where the Democrats were up there. You had all these Democrats, they started off with 26. And in fact, I said, “There’s no way they pick Kamala because she treated him worse than anybody else and her poll numbers were dropping like a rock, right. But they asked who is going to give money, healthcare to illegal aliens? And they all raised their hand. Remember Joe, he’s looking around. He didn’t understand the question. He didn’t.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (55:11)\nAt least he has an excuse because has no clue what the hell they’re asking. But do you remember his position? He was like this. Their hands are all up. We’re going to give all our money away. Forget about all your people. That’s a big crowd by the way. Look at that. Show it. Show it please. Turn those cameras, please. That’s a beautiful crowd. That’s beautiful. But remember Joe, so he’s standing there. He’s going to give healthcare to illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, in other words, right. They come in illegally and under a plan, they have the manifesto. They want to give them a lawyer. That’s what we need is more lawyers now, okay. They want to give them a lawyer. They want to give them education.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (55:58)\nThey want to give them healthcare, but they asked the question and I said, “Wow,” because I think they had like 26 people originally, but every one of them raised their hand including Sleepy Joe. And what happened is Joe’s like this, everybody other hand, and Joe, you could se he’s… For 47 years, he’s got the itch because he knows this isn’t going to work. He’s saying to himself, because you know there’s still something left. Not much, but he’s saying to himself there’s a natural instinct, right, a political instinct. And his shoulder went up and then his hand so I don’t know. I don’t think I’m even going to hold it to him. I’m not going to hold him. I got enough. How about the no fracking?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (56:41)\nWe will not frack. Do you understand me? We will not. Then he gets a nomination, goes to Pennsylvania where they are reliant on energy and fracking and the jobs, probably 900 to a million jobs, right. Goes there the day after he says he’s not fracking. He says, “We will frack. We will frack.” And they don’t hold it to him. If I ever did that, it would be the end, but never going to be the end for us either, is it? You know that. Never going to be the end because we have something going that nobody has ever had going. We have a relationship with the people that nobody’s ever had. Not because I do think I’m a nice guy. A lot of people, they say suburbia, the suburban. I’ve saved the suburbs. Okay, I’ve saved the suburbs. Then I heard I’m not doing well with suburban women, okay.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (57:35)\nI got rid of… No, it’s true. They say that. But of course they said that last election too. He will do terribly with women, terribly. And then when I did great with women, they said, “Man, he did well with women.” Same thing’s going to happen. You know what I find? Suburban women, period, they want security. They don’t want their home values going down. They don’t want a low-income housing project built in the middle of suburbia next to their house. And we have a rule that’s a disaster. It’s a regulation, and I said to Ben Carson, and some people, I say, “I want to terminate.” They looked at me. They go, “Well, we can amend it.” I said, “You don’t understand. I want to terminate it.” You all know about it. It’s a disaster where they change the zoning and they make it impossible and you end up with low-income housing all over the place.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (58:24)\nAnd remember this, 29 to 30% of the people living in suburbia are minorities. So this has nothing to do with discrimination. It has nothing to do with anything. What it has to do is with the American dream, the American dream. We’re not going to destroy the American dream for stupid people like Cory Booker. He was putting Corey Booker in charge. How about that one? That’s a beauty. Yeah. He did a great job as mayor of Newark, New Jersey. That worked out. How’s Newark doing? This election is a choice between Trump recovery at a level that nobody’s ever seen before and a Biden depression. If they get elected, they’re going to double and triple and quadruple your taxes. You will have a depression the likes of which this country has never seen before and that probably includes 1929, okay.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (59:22)\nAnd one thing we learned about the farmers, they don’t do well in depressions. Do we agree? They don’t do well. Nobody does well under depression. You will have problems like you’ve never had before. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolonged the pandemic. And by the way for those states, open up your states. Open them up. Watch on November 4th. November 4th, all these Democrat governors that have locked downs, right. I always said, I said right at the beginning, I think it was me that came out first. They’ll try and say, “20 years ago somebody said the same thing,” but I said, “The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.” And if you look at what’s happening with these lockdown to children, get the children back to school.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:00:21)\nI’ll give you an example. The children, 99.9%. Barron Trump, you know he had the Corona 19, the China virus. It’s got 21 different names. I could go over it, but to me Corona means Italy. China is China, and it came from China so he had the China virus, right. And he had it for such a short period of time. I don’t even think he knew he had it because they’re young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off 99.9% and Barron is beautiful and he’s free. Thank my wife, our First Lady who loves Iowa by the way. Our first lady, she put out that Barron has tested positive.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:01:21)\nAnd I said, “Wow.” And we talked about it. I said, “You put it out.” It’s personal stuff, but we really have it. I said, “Yeah, let’s put it out.” Barron’s tested positive. Within like two seconds, it was Barron is just fine now. He’s tested negative, right. Because it happens. People have it and it goes. Get the kids back to school. We got to get the kids back to school. Get them back to school. All right. Get them back. Get them back. And when I had it, you might’ve read, maybe most of you don’t know this, but I had it too. I didn’t love it, but it’s a little tough and you have a temperature and you don’t feel good. And then the scarier part is where’s it going?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:02:06)\nIt’s fine. You’re at a 101 or a 102 and then you say that, “I don’t love this.” You haven’t had a temperature in years and then all of a sudden you have it, but you see what happens to people. And I went to the hospital and it’s an incredible hospital, Walter Reed. I’ve seen what they’ve done because I’ve been there many times for our great warriors that come back so badly wounded. And these doctors are incredible. And one thing when you’re president, I’m laying in this bed, not feeling my best. And I’m surrounded by 12 doctors, one’s the head of Johns Hopkins, one’s the head of Walter Reed, one’s the head… These incredible doctors. And I looked at the alternatives, all things we developed in the last seven months, and one of them is Regeneron. And I said, “I’ll take that one because it is very early into testing, but it had great numbers.” And I’m telling you, they gave me this and they call it a therapeutic.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:03:01)\nTo me, it’s a cure because I felt like Superman the following morning. I felt like… In fact, I made a speech about a day later, two days later. Somebody said he looks better now than he did two weeks ago. What the hell is going on? So this is what’s happening. We’re making tremendous progress. The vaccines are coming out very soon. A lot of great things are happening on that front, but a lot of great things are happening for our country. I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received to… I want to give it to all of the people that qualify for it, people in hospitals, people just before they go to hospitals. It will clean out our hospitals. Eli Lilly makes a very similar drug and we’re going to do it free. We’re going to do it free. It’s not their fault. We’re going to do it free. So we’re in that process of getting an emergency, it’s called emergency use authorization.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:03:56)\nAnd we’re going to Regeneron and the Eli Lilly, a comparable drug, we’re going to give it to everybody. And I hope they have the kind of luck that I have, but maybe I would have been perfect anyway. I like to say, “I didn’t need it. I would have been perfect anyway because I’m so strong.” I said sarcastically, I said, “Well, I’m in no danger because I’m in perfect physical shape and I’m very young.” And CNN goes and reports President Trump lied to the American public. They said, “Can you believe this?” I was telling last night we had an incredible rally in Pennsylvania. Oh, they’re doing at CNN. I thought they were doing it to me, I said, “We don’t have too many of them anymore.”\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:04:44)\nDo you ever notice? At the beginning when we started, we would always have the phony people that stand up and raise their voice, then go home to mom and get balled up. I don’t know. I shouldn’t be talking about this because all of a sudden we’ll have one, but we don’t have that anymore. I learned about the cameras because the cameras never like showing it. Look where that crowd goes to. Look where that crowd goes to, all the way back to the buildings. And I’m always telling I never thought the cameras could move. And then I just noticed whenever we had a troublemaker in the audience, they’d spin around. They’d be in a pretzel, right? They can do anything these guys. I thought they were rigid, like a rigid piece of steel. They don’t turn, but if we had in the back room behind the pillar somebody, that camera would be turned around like a snake 15 different angles. But that sounds good. That’s a brand new F35 fighter jet. You can’t see it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:05:40)\nThey say it’s the greatest plane in the world. And by the way, speaking of that, our military, when I came in the world’s most overrated general told me, “Sir, we have no ammunition because we may have had a conflict very early in.” And I said, “No president should ever hear that.”, And we have rebuilt our military $ 2.5 trillion all made in the USA with equipment like that, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia and China and any other country. We have equipment that nobody has. Our missiles, our rockets, our nuclear has been totally upgraded and pray to God we never have to use it because I see what happens. Pray to God, but if we didn’t have that, we could be in very big trouble. It’s a very tough situation. But you look at the new tanks that we’ve ordered from Ohio, by the way. We kept the Lima, the Lima Plant. I said, “Keep it open.” They were going to close it. I said, “Keep it open.”\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:06:44)\nBefore I became president, I said, “Keep it open,” because I visited. I said, “You could never build a plant like this. You could never get the people to make the tanks and we’re going to be ordering tanks.” we’ve totally rebuilt our military. We have the greatest missiles, rockets, tags, fighters, bombers, tankers, ships in the world, all made in the USA.\nSpeaker 2: (01:07:09)\nUSA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:07:15)\nYou can be proud of your country. Look at this young handsome, this young, handsome farmer. You’re going to be a farmer someday? You’re going to be a farmer? Huh? He goes, “Hell yeah.” I’d like to be a farmer too sometimes I’ll tell you. We’re joined tonight by some incredible friends and great people. Your governor, who’s done an incredible job, Kim Reynolds and Kevin, her husband. Where is Kevin? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Really great job, Kim. How are we doing by the way, okay? We’re looking good. That’s good. Thank you for everything Kim. As well as Lieutenant Governor Adam Greg. Adam, thank you. Thank you very much Adam. Great job.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:08:07)\nIowa Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Naig. Mike, where’s Mike? Thank you, Mike. Iowas Senate Majority Leader, Jack Whitver. Thank you. See the way they all stay together. They like each other. Speaker of the Iowa House, oh, you got to tell me this. This is good genes I think, right. There are genes involved here, right. Pat Grassley, right. Good genes. What’s the relationship Pat? Huh? That’s good stuff. You got good stock. I want to bet on that guy in the future. Thank you very much. Great job. I hear you’re doing a great job. We’re doing all right? Good. Thank you Pat. Ambassador Terry Branstad. Okay, do we have time for one quick story about Branstad? Because his son, Eric is even better than him, but I’m not going to talk about it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:09:13)\nAnd here’s the guy that doesn’t mind me saying.a lot of fathers, they get angry if you say that. Oh, I’m better than my son. Those are not great fathers. This guy’s proud. His son is great. But when I met Terry, it was long before I thought about this and I heard the Governor of Iowa was in New York and he wanted to see me. I said, “Oh, what the hell do I want to see the Governor of Iowa for?” I’m putting up buildings and I’m saying, “All right.” And I invited him before I ever thought about really doing this, early on at least. And he came up and a humble guy, great guy, handsome guy. That face, right. And he sat down and I figured I’d give him five minutes. Kim, no longer than that five. And I ended up spending an hour and a half. I said, “That is the smartest governor.” And then I learned, and as you know, he was the governor for 24 years. That’s an all time record in the United States, right. 24 years.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:10:07)\nAnd he told me a story in the first meeting. That was before I think that I was even thinking about doing this. And again, it’s only because Obama and Biden were so bad. I said, “Let me do it.” I wish I didn’t have to, but I’m having a lot of fun because we’re making such progress. But he told me a story. He said, “Many years ago I met a man in China because he was selling corn.” Can you believe it, right, corn crops. And he was selling corn. And he said to his wife, this is 35, 40 years ago. He said, “I met a man in China and I went home to my wife and I said, ‘I just met the next president of China many years forward, but I just met a future president of China.’ And I said, ‘Who was that?’\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:10:54)\nIt was President Xi, who’s now the President of China.” And I said, “You got to be kidding.” He said, “Nope. I could tell right from the beginning he was different.” And I’m not happy with what’s going on, but he said, “I just met the next president.” And then I remembered that story and then I ran and he was so incredible to me and Iowa and he wanted us to win and his son was very much in charge of what we were doing and it worked out great and we won by a lot. And then we won the whole thing. And I said “We have to pick somebody really smart for China.” And I said, “The Governor of Iowa came to me and told me that story and I told him. I said, ‘How would you like to be ambassador to China?’ And he said, ‘Sir, I’ve been doing this for 24 years. It would be an honor.’ And I have to tell you this, he represented us great with China.”\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:11:46)\nHe represented us great. I never told that story. I never told that story, but about a month ago, he called and he said, “Sir, I want to come home now. I want to make sure you get reelected. I want to come home.” And he’s out there. I know he’s out there working, but we love him. He’s a special guy. We’ve got a couple of real beauties with Grassley and with this guy. I’ll tell you, what a couple of great people. Thank you very much for everything. Great job you did as ambassador. The only question I have is do we call you Mr. Ambassador or Mr. Governor? What do you like?\nTerry Branstad: (01:12:19)\nEither one.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:12:20)\nHe said, “Either one’s okay.” That’s him. Anyway, thank you very much. Great job. I want to introduce another one who’s one of the best, maybe the best in the whole country. He’s the chairman of the Iowa GOP, Jeff Kaufmann. You look good Jeff. You lost weight Jeff. You lost weight. I’m proud of you, Jeff. You do a great job. How are we doing?\nJeff Kaufmann: (01:12:50)\nIowa is yours.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:12:54)\nHe said, “Iowa is ours.” Always be careful. He said, “Iowa is yours.” I say, “Never say that.” The last one, Beto, remember when he said that he was running for president. He was doing okay. And he was on the cover of a third grade magazine called Vanity Fair and he made the statement, “I was born to do this.” I said, “That’s the end of his political career.” He was born to do it. That didn’t work out. I hear we’re doing great. Thank you very much, Jeff. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Congressional candidate, a star, a guy who’s going to be fantastic, David Young. David, thank you. You got a lot of good candidates. We’re also joined by a very special guest, one of the greatest wrestlers in American history. You know that, right?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:13:45)\nHe’s an unbelievable guy. I’ve known about him for a long time. Do we all love Jim Jordan, our Congressman, right? Jim Jordan. Jim Jordan is a great wrestler, a great NCAA champion. I know a lot of people don’t know that, but Jim, and Jim’s from Ohio, but he says the greatest of them all is a guy named Dan Gable. You ever hear of Dan Gable? And listen to this. I mean, I have to tell you, is Dan here? I hope he’s here. Come here Dave. Come on. Come on. Look at this. You mean I can’t take this guy in a fight? Can you believe it? Wow. Wow. [inaudible 00:20:32]. Hey Dan, I’m immune and I can’t give it to you so that’s good. We love you so. But I met Dan a few years ago and I looked at him and I said, “How come he’s 181-1. Think of it. He won 181. People don’t know that’s crazy. 181-1. I’m going to ask you later on who is the one? I want to find out who, but he did something else. He won the Olympics 1972. And to do that, he had to wrestle against the six greatest wrestlers in that weight class in the world. And he did something never done before. He didn’t yield one point throughout the whole thing and he ended up beating in the Olympic finals for the gold medal, he beat the great Russian wrestler. Didn’t get a point. He went through the whole thing. Nobody got a point and I’m looking at him and I’m saying to myself, “I’m telling you, I could take him, but I better not try.”\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:15:39)\nBut Dan has been inducted into the USA Wrestling Hall of Fame, the US Olympic Hall of Fame, the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, and the United World Wrestling Hall of Fame, and he’s become University of Iowa’s all time most winning coach. In fact, Jim Jordan said, He was as great a coach as he was a wrestler.” He won many. How many championships did you win as a coach Dan?\nDan Gable: (01:16:04)\n15.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:16:04)\n15. And I come from a town where you have the Jets, they never win. You have the Mets, they never win. We won 15. That’s called talent. It’s called extraordinary talent actually. And what I did is I thought about it. I thought about it long and hard. We’re very selective. So the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the two greatest awards you can get in our country. And I’m proud to announce that I will be awarding very shortly at the White House in the Oval Office, Coach Gable the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Say something Joe. Great honor.\nDan Gable: (01:16:52)\nWow. That’s humbling. That’s humbling because that’s the highest honor. I’m used to winning and have to do it and on the mat, but because I did it so many times on the mat and in other places that I’m actually getting some other awards where I can just do it and they give it to me. See, the thing about this guy is I’ve coached a lot of athletes over all the years. And I’ll tell you what, when I look at them and I hear them, they kind of remind me a little bit of this guy right here. And every one of them, you had to mold, every one of them, you had to learn a little bit more. They had to get better and every one of them did. And that’s why they were not just one time champions. This guy’s already a one time champion, but because he’s open for learning and he’s already very competent that he’s going to be a multi champion President of the United States of America.\nSpeaker 2: (01:18:21)\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:18:46)\nWell, he’s the pride of Iowa and he’s great. You always try and figure out what makes a champion because you look at him. Nice guy, good looking guy, all that stuff, but why is he 181-1? Why is he a gold medalist that’s done something that nobody ever did? Didn’t allow one point of any of these wrestlers and they’re all the best of the world, the toughest, and it’s just something different and you’ll probably never figure it out. It is with great champions. You see it and you see it all the time with great champions, but there are very few. Jack Nicklaus you see it. Tiger got the same award. When Tiger won the Masters a few months ago, I said, “You know what, that’s an incredible thing he did.” And we gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom and he said it’s one of the greatest honors. He actually said it’s his greatest honor. I said, “Tiger, you deserve it.”\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:19:35)\nHe went through a lot and he came back and… But you have great champions and they’re different and nobody knows why. That man is different and he’s a champion and it’s an honor to present you to the people that love you most, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. We’ve got a V-shape, we’re going to see some very big numbers and you’re seeing it. In my first three years, family income increased by $6,000. That’s more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. African-American income grew nine times more than it did under Biden and Obama. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty. So proud of that. African-American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached the lowest levels in history. At the end of the last administration, the Congressional Budget Office projected fewer than 2 million jobs would be created over the next three years and we crushed that prediction and created almost 8 million jobs. Nobody can believe it and we’re doing it…\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:21:03)\nNobody can believe it. We’re doing it again. My policies have benefited those who needed it the most. The bottom 50% of households saw an astonishing 40% increase in net worth after our tax cuts, wages grew fastest for the nicest, I mean it makes me feel so good, blue collar workers. They were the ones that had the biggest benefit from what we did. Since the China virus, we have created a record 11.4 million jobs. That’s a record. We’ve never created jobs at a level at which we’re creating them now. We’ve already cut the unemployment rate in half, we’re down to 7.8%. Sounds high, but a lot of people said we’re going to be a 42%. We’re down to 7.8 and going down rapidly. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost, 30 months. We did it in five months. Jobs have been recovering. Think of this. Jobs have been recovering 23 times faster than the Obama-Biden recovery. 23 times faster. Not 23%, 23 times faster.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:22:23)\nI’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He supported NAFTA, a disaster. Now you have USMCA, it’s the best. It’s now kicked in. He supported TPP. Would have destroyed your farms, would have destroyed everything, and our auto industry would have been gone, and he supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, a catastrophe for our nation. China tries to get away with the fact that they are a developing nation. Not anymore. If Biden wins, China wins. That’s what’s going to happen. If Biden wins, China will own our country. They’ll own it. And if we win, Iowa wins, and America wins, and we’re going to win for a long time.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:23:15)\nFor decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. As I mentioned, one of the things that was very important to me was to eliminate the very unfair estate tax or death tax on small businesses and farms. Now, if you love your child and you’re a farmer and you think he’s doing a great job or she’s doing a great job, and she wants to keep the farm or he wants to keep the farm, there is no more estate tax where they have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay the tax.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:24:17)\nIs there anybody here who has a child to which they do not want to leave the farm because they don’t like their child? Raise your hand, please. Does anybody have the courage? There’s one person over there. He says he’s only kidding. No, but it’s a big thing. I mean, look, it’s a big thing. A lot of farms were put out of business. The parents, they pass away, they leave the farm to the son, the daughter, to the family, and the family has to go out and borrow a fortune and then they have a little bad season, a couple of bad seasons, and they end up losing everything. We don’t have that anymore. We cut the estate tax, it’s out, gone.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:24:54)\nThese are things a lot of people don’t even know. We’ve got that. Along with the tax cuts, we got that. Biden wants to repeal our tax cuts and massively raised taxes on your family farms. And what we did was hit the, you know this, you know exactly, we hit it so quickly. We hit so hard. We hit so strong on this whole tax situation because the farmers were being treated unfairly. So unfairly with respect to taxes. I quickly issued a major disaster declaration and I will be with you every step of the way. I think Kim will say this, your governor, when you had floods all over the place, you were like a large scale swimming pool. I hate to say it, Iowa. I looked at the pictures that your governor sent. I said, “Kim, I never knew that this was ocean front property.” And we took care of you, right? We gave you everything you needed and we got rid of all of, we’ve rebuilt the dams and the dikes. Right? We rebuilt it and we rebuilt it fast.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:25:59)\nMy opponent is foot forward, a radical plan to eliminate US borders by implementing catch and release, imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals of illegal alien. So if you have somebody that’s a murderer or a rapist, we can’t do it. They agreed with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. There’s nobody that knows how to lose like Bernie. Four years ago, he lost, he went home happy. He lost again because Pocahontas refused to get out of the race. Otherwise, I would have been running against Bernie. I don’t know which is better. There would have been a lot more enthusiasm for Bernie, smaller base, more enthusiasm, Bernie got, I’ll tell you.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:26:37)\nWe’re going to get a lot of the Bernie voters because they don’t like Joe. And they love our policy on dealing with other nations because they love our policy on trade because they understand. They happen to understand that, but they also know we can do something about it. Bernie would have never been able to do that. The United States would be completely overrun in a matter of days. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we are finishing the wall. It’s now over 400 miles long. It’s already built. And as I said, Mexico is paying for the wall.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:27:20)\nWe did more, one of these fake reporters said it, we did more, one of the only politicians that’s ever run, forget about politician, but one of the only politicians ever run that actually has done more than he or she has promised. As an example, I campaigned a lot in Iowa. I never mentioned the word space force, but when I got into office, I realized I looked at Russia, I looked at Kim Jong-un, I looked at China. I said, “We need a space force,” and we got space force. I never talked about it on the campaign trail.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:27:54)\nWe also passed VA choice for our great veterans and VA accountability, things that they said were impossible to get done. So now, instead of waiting online for weeks and weeks, if they have to wait, they go out to a doctor, we pay the bill and it’s been a great thing. 91% approval rating in the VA. They’re doing a great job over there. Think of it, I shouldn’t be telling you this because they’ll find a vet someplace who’s unhappy. But think of it, all our lives we used to see on the evening news horror shows with the vets and the vets and the vets, and it’s terrible what they’re doing. You don’t see any stories about the VA. You don’t see any stories. We have done 91% approval rating by the vets for the VA, the job we’re doing.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:28:43)\nAnd we defeated 100%. We’re bringing our soldiers home, but we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq. And when I took over, it was a mess. And we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for years and years. And we then took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many other troops and many other people, Qasem Soleimani is dead. Dead.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:29:22)\nOne of the biggest things to happen in the Middle East in 50 years. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear catastrophe. $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. That deal’s practically expiring now anyway, if we didn’t terminate it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And you know that presidents have been talking about that for decades. Every president said they were going to do that, then they never had the guts to do it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and that’s been 52 years they’ve been talking about that. I got it done in about two hours.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:30:17)\nAnd instead of endless war, we’re forging peace in the Middle East. So I get nominated for three Nobel Peace Prizes, different subjects. And I told the story the other night, I was in Florida or Pennsylvania, I told our First Lady, “Darling, we’re going to have the greatest publicity I’ve ever had tonight. I got nominated for the Nobel Prize. Do you know what that is, darling.” Let’s go home. So I leave for the first time in a long time, early. I get home, I turn on the television. They talked about your floods in Iowa. They talked about how’s Iowa doing with the crops. How’s this happening? How are they doing in Florida? Three, four stores, one after another, where’s my Nobel Peace Prize, they don’t talk about it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:31:03)\nI said, “Darling, this news is a little tough. It’s a little tough to crack.” When Obama got his Nobel Prize, it was so early he didn’t even do anything. He still doesn’t know what he got at for. They said, “Why did you get it?” He said, “I have no idea.” And it was the biggest story, it was all over the place. With me, I got three and they got three dominations, nobody talks about it. So at least I figured I might as well mentioned it, right? Kim, I should mention it, right? Kevin. Right, Kevin? Kevin, stand up please, Kevin. There’s the guy.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:31:38)\nI went on a hunting trip. My son, Don, he loves hunting. And he went Kevin, Don and about 300 of the governors, your previous Terri, your previous governor’s friends. And they all went hunting and it was like 25 degrees below zero. The only two guys that stood out there the whole time were Kevin and Don Trump Jr. And they came back. Everyone else was back at about 15 minutes, Terry, right? There were all back and they wanted to go back into the lodge, the hell with this. And after a weekend, my son comes back and Kevin comes back and you two guys didn’t even know what they were talking about. You didn’t know what the problem was. Right? People don’t know that about Don and they don’t know that, but Kevin is fantastic. Thank you Kevin, for being here. Appreciate it. He’s a real guy.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:32:22)\nSo I’m ending the old wars and Biden will lead us into new wars. And we did more in 47 months than Biden did in 47 years, and that’s a fact. And if you look at the Democrats, they’re pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. Their plan would destroy your social security, destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. I got the travel ban. Everyone said, “Oh, that’s not nice.” I said, “Really?” It’s not nice to come up and blow up cities either is it? We won on the United States Supreme Court and he wants to end it. And surge refugee admissions by 700%, meaning 700% opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. No thank you. No thank you, sleepy Joe. He’ll ban school choice and he’ll ban charter schools, very important places.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:33:25)\nCivil rights all starts with the education and we need school choice. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. We’ve already started. We’ve already started. It’s an incredible thing because it’s great education for less money. It’s sort of a crazy thing. Less money, great education. And just to finish up, a vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already happened.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:34:19)\nWe will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your Second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might. We have never, ever been even close to as strong as we are right now, greatest equipment ever in our history. And we will ensure peace through strength.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:35:16)\nIf you remember, when I ran, they said, “Oh, he’s a very militant kind of a guy. We’ll be in a war the first week.” Well, where’s the war? Where’s the war? And I’m making other countries pay because NATO, they weren’t paying their bills. They were delinquent to use the New York real estate term. They weren’t paying their bills. I said, “You got to pay.” The secretary general of NATO is my single biggest fan. They’re paying $130 billion a year more now because I said, “Look, you got to pay. You got to pay.” They rip us on trade and there was supposed to protect them, the European Union. So NATO, so they’re paying 130 billion more going to $410 billion more each year. So that’s it. Where are the wars? He’s going to get us into a war. Where are the wars? They don’t want any part of us. Nobody wants any part of us in the world. They were tired of being ripped off as a country.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:36:13)\nWe will end surprise medical billing. The surprise medical billing is a disaster. It’s ending as of January 1st. Require price transparency, all signed, all done, January 1st. Can you imagine if I lose and I’ve done all these things? They kick in on January 1st. You’re going to say “Boy, that Biden’s done a great job on price transparency.” And they’ll say, “What are you thinking? He has no idea what the hell it is.” And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. We went through a favorite nations clause so that we will pay the lowest drug prices in the world. Okay?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:36:55)\nWe will strongly protect Medicare and social security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And when I took over, NASA was basically closed. It was shredded, it was nothing. And now it’s the number one preeminent space center, anywhere in the world by far. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education through our schools.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:37:39)\nWe will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust, and it won’t change. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Iowa.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:38:19)\nGet your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your workers and coworkers and get the hell out to vote because if I don’t get Iowa, I won’t believe that one. I may never have to come back here again if I don’t get Iowa. I’ll never be back. You understand that Kim? I will say this. There has never been a president has done more for farmers and ranchers. For the farm belt, for Iowa, there’s never been a president that’s even come close to what I’ve done. And I will say that and I’ll say it louder and clearer. I’ll say that loud and clear. From Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids to Rock Rapids, from Davenport to right here in Des Moines, we stand on the shoulders of Iowa patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We inherit the legacy of American heroes.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:39:19)\nJust nobody has anything more than what you have so much. Look at yourselves and look where you’ve come. Look even in the world of politics, Iowa, it’s Iowa. And by the way, as long as I’m here, Iowa, and I made this pledge to you four years ago, Iowa will always come first in the rotation. You know what that means, right? There’s a lot of pressure. Let’s put them back. I said, “No, you’re not putting them back.” You know why? Because that’s called the opposite of cancel culture. That’s called a great American tradition. Iowa will always be number one. Okay? You can forget it. We inherit the legacy of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. So much you’ve done. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:40:39)\nProud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Because we are one movement, we are one people in one family. We are one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Iowa, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you Iowa. Thank you. Thank you very much.",

         "Mike Pence: (02:27)\nWell hello, Michigan. The Peter Meijer, the State Republican Chair, Laura Cox, National Committeewoman, Kathy Berden, and all the great men and women of Lacks Enterprises. My fellow Americans, it is great to be back in the Wolverine State. I appreciate y’all coming out. Feels and looks like fall in the heartland, doesn’t it? I just love it. But I got to be honest with you, I’m here for one reason. And one reason only, and that is the Michigan and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. It’s on. And the road to victory runs right through Michigan.\nMike Pence: (03:19)\nAnd while you’re at it, President Trump and I need Michigan to send John James to the United States Senate. And Grand Rapids needs to send that West Point grad army veteran, a man who’s led humanitarian efforts at home and around the world to Capitol Hill. We need Peter Meijer in a new Republican majority in the United States Congress. So thank you all for coming out. And if you got a seat, you can grab it. Four years ago, a movement was born. A movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. Here in Michigan, you knew we could be strong again. You knew we could be prosperous again.\nMike Pence: (04:10)\nYou said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016 and I know Michigan’s going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020. And we’re out there telling the story, about a week ago, I was in Salt Lake City, Utah, we had a little debate out there between Joe Biden’s running mate. Some people think we did okay. Thank you. But let me be clear with all of you, it was a privilege for me to be on that stage representing our president. Because that debate was not so much a debate between two candidates is it was between two visions. I mean, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine.\nMike Pence: (05:04)\nThey want to abolish fossil fuels. They want taxpayer funding of abortion. They want to defund the police and pack the Supreme Court. Don’t you doubt. President Trump’s vision, we rebuild our military, we cut taxes. We rollback regulation. We unleashed American energy, secured our border, supported law enforcement. And we have stood for liberty for life in the constitution of the United States every single day. When you compare the Biden Harris agenda with our agenda, the choice is clear.\nMike Pence: (05:45)\nIf you cherish faith and freedom and law and order and life in a little less than three weeks, we need to reelect President Donald Trump for more years in the White House.\nAudience: (05:57)\nFour more years, four more years, four more years, four more years.\nMike Pence: (06:07)\nNow you’re talking.\nAudience: (06:08)\nFour more years, four more years.\nMike Pence: (06:11)\nFour years ago, we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts. An economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values, but in three short years, all of that’s changed. Most importantly, we rebuilt our military. We restored the arsenal of democracy and we are once again given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guard, the resources and the support that they need to defend this nation. We’re doing it. As the proud father of a United States Marine and the father-in-law, the United States navy pilot who’s currently deployed. I have to tell you, I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. It’s true. And we haven’t just stood with those who wear the uniform. President Donald Trump has stood with all the men and women who have served in the uniform of the United States. Donald Trump is the most pro-veteran president in my lifetime.\nMike Pence: (07:46)\nWhen Joe Biden was vice president, you all remember it here in Michigan. When Joe Biden was vice president, we saw years of scandal at the VA that literally shocked the conscience of the nation. But under President Trump’s leadership, we signed the most sweeping reforms of the VA in 50 years. We fired thousands of VA employees that weren’t giving our veterans the care they deserve. And Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran in America.\nMike Pence: (08:24)\nI got to believe among us there are lots of men and women who have worn the uniform of the United States just like your future Congressman Peter Meijer. So if you’re able to stand or raise your hand, if you served in the armed forces of the United States, would you mind just standing up or raising your hand and letting us say thank you one more time. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service, army.\nMike Pence: (08:56)\nWe didn’t just rebuild our military and stand with our veterans, but after the slowest, I want to say that again. It was the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression, President Donald Trump lit the fires of the American economy, and we created the greatest economy the world has ever known in three short years. Where Joe Biden wants to raise taxes. In our first three years, we cut taxes across the board for working families, businesses large and small. This president signed more bills, cutting federal red tape than any president in American history.\nMike Pence: (09:33)\nWe unleashed American energy fought for free and fair trade. And in just three years, businesses large and small created seven million good paying jobs, including 125,000 jobs right here in the Wolverine State. It’s true. Those first three years, Michigan achieved its lowest unemployment rate in 20 years. And right in this state, the average hourly earnings grew nearly as much in our first three years as they did in all eight years that Joe Biden was vice-president. And maybe what’s most important to the president and me, after wages had been stagnant for many years all across the heartland, wages were rising at their fastest pace in more than 10 years. And they were rising most rapidly for hard working blue collar Americans, the forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no more.\nMike Pence: (10:41)\nI’m from just down south in the Hoosier State, I always like stay out in this part of the country. We do two things particularly well. We make things and we grow things, right? And this president from early on said that we were going to bring American jobs back. We were going to bring the heartland back. We’re going to bring back those four beautiful words made in the USA and that’s just what we’ve done. President Trump’s leadership, those less taxes, less regulations, fighting for free and fair trade. I’m proud to report here in the great state of Michigan that the automotive industry is roaring back in America.\nMike Pence: (11:28)\nLast year, GM announced they were adding 400 jobs in this state and Fiat Chrysler already is building a $1.6 billion new assembly plant here in Michigan that’s going to create 6,400 good paying jobs. Now, that’s quite a contrast. When Joe Biden was vice-president, you all remember, they actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And the last president four years ago said they were never coming back. Remember all that? He said, “What magic wand do you have?” Well, we didn’t need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. 500,000 manufacturing jobs created in just three years, 20,000 here in the Wolverine State. I’m telling you leadership matters. I promise you President Donald Trump and I will always put Michigan workers and Michigan jobs first. So it’s been about security and about prosperity. When President Donald Trump every day of this administration has also stood strong for the rule of law. We’ve appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And I can tell you firsthand, they are all men and women who will uphold all the god-given liberties in our constitution like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms.\nMike Pence: (13:13)\nLast month we rightly paused as a nation to honor the life and service of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But when the memorials were over, President Donald Trump fulfilled his duty under the constitution when he nominated a brilliant, principled, conservative woman to the Supreme Court of the United States in Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Isn’t she something? Amazing, amazing. But they’re in day three of those hearings in the United States Senate. The president and I have continued to call on senators to provide Judge Barrett with a respectful hearing and to respect that nomination every day. But you know, we have-\nMike Pence: (14:03)\nAnd to respect that nomination every day, but you know, we have reason to be concerned. You all remember a couple of years ago when Judge Barrett was nominated to the Court of Appeals out this way. The ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee criticized her Catholic faith saying, and I quote, “The dogma lives loudly within you,” and Hollywood liberals already started attacking her faith from the day the president nominated her to the Supreme Court. Well, I got a message for the Democrats and their Hollywood friends, that dogma lives loudly in me, that dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and work and worship, according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the constitution of the United States of America.\nMike Pence: (15:11)\nSo the Senate has a job to do. They’re going about their constitutional role to advise and consent, then after they finished their work, I’ll make you a prediction. Judge Amy Coney Barrett is going to be Justice Amy Coney Barrett. We’re going to fill that seat on the Supreme Court of the United States.\nMike Pence: (15:48)\nNow, while we’re talking about the Supreme Court, the people of Michigan deserve to know that after 150 years with nine members of the Supreme Court of the United States, leading Democrats in Washington are actually talking about packing the court.\nMike Pence: (16:10)\nYou all saw Joe Biden refuse to answer the question during the presidential debate. Has running mate, Kamala Harris, during the primaries actually said that she was quote, “Absolutely open to packing the court.” And when I tried to get her to answer the question during our debate, she ducked it. Last Friday, Joe Biden was asked if voters didn’t deserve to know if he plans to pack the court. And he said, quote, “No, they don’t.”\nMike Pence: (16:42)\nAnd yesterday he dodged the question again. Refused to rule it out. You know, when you’re running for the highest office in the land, you owe it to the American people to say whether or not you’re to respect the highest court in the land. There’s only one explanation why they won’t answer the question. You know, out here in the heartland, we like to say, “I was born in the morning, but not yesterday morning.” I mean, come on everybody, they’re ducking the question because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to pack the Supreme Court with liberal judges if they win this election. They’re going to add seats to the Supreme Court of the United States and fill them with activist judges in what would be the biggest power grab in American history. But we’re not going to let it happen, we’re going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and reelect a Republican majority in the United States Senate with John James in that chamber. I mean, we’re going to stand on the constitution and we’re going to preserve an independent judiciary. It’s just that serious. And speaking to the rule of law, I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a president who has stood every day with the men and women who serve in law enforcement at every level across America. President Donald Trump and I know what you know, and that is the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. They deserve the respect of every American every day. When I was growing up down in small town in southern Indiana, we used to drive up to Chicago where my folks grew up, visit my grandparents. I’d see my uncle getting dressed for work as a young man, still living at home. He’d put on that police officer’s uniform, Chicago PD, and me and my three brothers would just stand there in awe as he came out in that uniform with that sidearm at his side. All of my heroes wear uniforms.\nMike Pence: (19:21)\nNow we’ve stood with law enforcement, but I want to be clear, President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech. Violence against innocent civilians, the destruction of property or violence against law enforcement will not be tolerated and those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Now, for months, all Joe Biden and his running mate talked about were peaceful protesters, remember? All summer long, while the American people literally watched businesses in their communities burn. At that debate last week, I traveled there and invited Flora Westbrook to join me. I’d met Flora in Minneapolis, just a couple of weeks earlier. Wonderful African-American business owner. She opened a salon 35 years ago in Minneapolis. It’s really kind of the heart of the community, and she told me in the days following the killing of George Floyd, she watched as the violent looters and protesters came closer and closer to her business until they burned her out. Flora deserved better. All of our families deserve better and we’re going to rebuild Flora’s business, rebuild that community for all of our families in all of our cities. We’re going to make it safe. We’re going to do it. What a wonderful woman.\nMike Pence: (21:12)\nYou know, the truth is, I think you all know Joe Biden would double down on the policies that have literally led to violence in our major cities. I mean, when you start to withdraw support for those who protect and serve, you only embolden those who would do harm to our families and our communities. Now, Joe Biden justifies it all by saying that he thinks America is quote, “Systemically racist,” and that police have, in his words, an implicit bias against minorities. When Joe Biden was asked if he’d support cutting funding to law enforcement, he said, “Yes, absolutely.” Let me make you a promise, under President Donald Trump, we’re going to back the blue. We’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. We’re going to have law enforcement in every city, in every state in this nation for every American of every race and creed and color, so help us God. You know, you all in Michigan know what we know down in the Hoosier state. We don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American families and neighbors and other minorities that live in our cities. I mean, this president has done both for three and half years, and we’re going to keep doing both for four more years. In our first three and a half years, we funded 4,000 new law enforcement officers through the COPS program, when the violence engulfed many of our cities, we launched Operation Legend, named after a four year old boy who was literally killed in his home while he slept in a pillow fort he and his dad had built. And now we’ve arrested more than 2,500 violent offenders in cities across the country.\nMike Pence: (23:24)\nBut as we supported law enforcement, I have to tell you how proud I am, in our first three years because of the economic policies we advanced, we had the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African-Americans. We had the highest funding ever for historically black colleges and universities. We passed criminal justice reform and we have fought to give every parent in every community, the right to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income and area code. So we’ve supported law enforcement and we’ve supported on minorities and we’ll keep doing it for four more years. And every single day, as we’ve supported the rule of law, this president has stood strong for the right of every American to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of their conscience. People of faith have no greater champion than President Donald Trump. Under this administration, we restored the conscience rights of doctors, nurses, teachers and religious charities, and President Donald Trump ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor and the Supreme Court voted seven to two to make it permanent. I mean, think about that. I’m the product of eight years of Catholic education. I have nothing but love and a deep respect for nuns. Can I get an amen on that? Anybody else? Thank you very much.\nMike Pence: (25:11)\nBut think about that, Little Sisters of the Poor, these are incredible women, answered a call of faith, a call of service, took a vow of poverty to do nothing other than help the underprivileged in their communities. And when Joe Biden was vice president, they hauled them into federal court to force them to compromise their faith and live under the mandates of Obamacare. And believe it or not, after the Supreme Court ruled, Joe Biden announced that he was going to reimpose the Obamacare mandates on the Little Sisters of the Poor and religious institutions around the country.\nMike Pence: (25:48)\nIn fact, the religious intolerance spans their whole ticket. His running mate, Kamala Harris, actually attacked one of our nominees to the Federal Court because he was a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. Well, let me make you a promise, with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, we’re going to respect the religious freedom of every American of every faith, so help us God.\nMike Pence: (26:26)\nBeyond all of that, beyond our security and our prosperity and law and order and our most cherished values. I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life, Where Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, President Donald Trump has stood strong for the unborn and President Trump is the most pro-life president in American history. It’s true.\nMike Pence: (27:12)\nSo we’ve rebuilt, our military revived our economy, stood for law and order, liberties and life. Let me say none of that would have been possible without the strong and consistent support of Michigan’s Republican delegation on Capitol Hill. That’s why right after you send John James to the United States Senate, we need you to send Bill Huizenga, Fred Upton, John Molenaar, Jack Bergman, Tim Walberg and Peter Meyer to a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives and retire Nancy Pelosi once and for all.\nMike Pence: (28:00)\nYou know, when you look at what we all were able to accomplish with Republican majorities in the House and Senate in our first two, it’s incredible. On our security, our economy, on our constitutional foundations. Only one way you can describe it, we made America great again. And then the Coronavirus struck from China. But I can tell you, when there were only five documented cases of Coronavirus in the United States, all of which had come back from China, President Trump did with no American president had ever done. He suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Joe Biden said that was hysterical. He said it was xenophobic. In fact, he wrote in the week before … I always keep an eye on the flag. A week before the President made that decision, you all deserve to know, Joe Biden said it would make things worse if you closed off travel from China. And in fact, back when they were dealing with the H1N1 in 2009, when Joe Biden was vice-president, they refused to close the border to Mexico. But I want to tell you firsthand, as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, President Trump’s action suspending all travel from China, saved untold American lives and bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. It’s a fact.\nMike Pence: (30:22)\nWe reinvented testing. We’ve done more than 120 million tests already. We saw it to the manufacturer and the delivery of billions of supplies of PPE and medical equipment to our incredible doctors and nurses. We’ve been developing medicines and therapeutics at a record pace, and we’re on track to have the first safe and effective vaccine before the end of this year with tens of millions of doses available for the most vulnerable. As President Trump said Saturday on the South Lawn, through the power of American science and medicine, we will eradicate the China virus once and for all that day will come.\nMike Pence: (31:06)\nI spoke to the President this morning, told him I was headed to Michigan and I’m happy to report each and every one of you, he’s back on the plane today, the President and the First Lady are doing great and he is out on the campaign trail. You just say on behalf of the President and the First Lady how moved we’ve all been by the outpouring of love and concern and prayers, not just for the first family, but for every family that’s been impacted by loss and difficulty through the midst of this pandemic. Those of you that are here and looking on that have lost loved ones, are struggling with this virus, just know you’ve always been in our hearts. The outpouring of concern from across the country for the President and the First Lady is really just emblematic of what the American people have been doing from day one with one another. In fact, could we just take a minute? Can we just say, show how grateful we are to the doctors, the nurses, the first responders to all of those in ministry who have come alongside families impacted by loss and hardship in the midst of this pandemic. The American people have been there for one another and it’s been truly inspiring. Thank you all. I promise all of you, we’re going to keep making sure that our doctors and nurses have all the resources they need to provide the level of healthcare to anyone in this country that we’d want a family member of ours to have. We’re going to keep protecting the vulnerable and keep saving lives.\nMike Pence: (33:02)\nWhile Joe Biden is talking about shutting down the economy, under President Donald Trump, we’re opening up America again. You know, in just the last five months, after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic because of the foundation that we poured, because of the extraordinary recovery and relief that the President secured from the Congress for families and businesses, we’ve already seen 11 and a half million Americans go back to work, including nearly 600,000 people right here in Michigan.\nMike Pence: (33:47)\nSo we’re opening up America and we are opening up American schools. Last week, we started distributing a hundred million rapid point-of-care tests to school nurses and administrators all across America so we can get our kids back in the classroom and keep them back in school where they belong. And thanks to President Trump’s leadership a week from this Saturday, Big 10 football is back. Michigan State will be back on the grid iron at Spartan Stadium and the Wolverines will be back in the Big House. We’re coming back. We’re coming back. We’ve got a great American comeback underway.\nMike Pence: (34:47)\nYou know, the truth is we’ve gone through a time of testing in this last year, but in less than three weeks, we’re going to come to a time for choosing. That’s the reason why we’re all here today. And I want to tell you from my heart, I think the choice in this election has never been clearer. The stakes have never been higher. It’s amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. President Trump, we not only cut taxes across the board in our first four years, we’re going to keep cutting taxes for middle-class Americans for four more years. Joe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape. The President had to remind him the other night that he actually supports the Green New Deal. He wants to put us back in the Paris Climate Accord.\nMike Pence: (35:49)\nPresident Trump, we’ve been cutting red tape at a record pace, and we still have the cleanest air and land and water in history and America is a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. When it comes to trade and jobs, the choice couldn’t even be clear. The truth is, when we took office, America was losing $500 billion a year in our trade imbalance to China. Where Joe Biden’s been a cheerleader for communist China all along the way, he said that the rise of China was a positive development. President Trump put China on notice on day one. He said, the era of economic surrender is over. We impose tariffs on China to level the playing field, and we’re going to stand strong until they respect American workers and American property.\nSpeaker 1: (36:56)\nUSA, USA, USA, USA, USA.\nMike Pence: (37:07)\nAnd here in the heartland, I don’t have to tell any of you about the impact of NAFTA. It’s amazing to think the day since NAFTA was signed into law, we literally saw 60,000 American factories close and many of those jobs go south of the border. Down in the Hoosier state, I saw one community almost entirely shuttered as thousands of jobs disappeared overnight and left our shores. I mean, the truth of the matter is all along the way, Joe Biden never lifted a finger to reform NAFTA, to renegotiate it in a way that put American jobs, automotive jobs here in the heartland first. But thanks to the man who wrote The Art of the Deal, Americans got a way better deal. NAFTA is gone and the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement is here. Now you may not know it, USMCA is a huge win for America, but it’s a big win for Michigan and Michigan auto workers. Under the USMCA, 75% of all auto parts have to be made in North America and 40% of them have to be made by workers making the average hourly wage equal to the average hourly wage in the United States of America. We are protecting American workers, protecting American jobs with the USMCA.\nMike Pence: (38:47)\nIt’s true.\nMike Pence: (38:50)\nNow the people in Michigan deserve to know, not only did Joe Biden not lift a finger to reform it for all those years, but Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris was one of only 10 senators to vote against the USMCA. She said the USMCA didn’t go far enough on climate change. And truth is Kamala Harris put her radical environmental agenda ahead of Michigan auto workers and Michigan auto jobs. That’s one more reason why Michigan needs to say no to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\nMike Pence: (39:32)\nAnd it’s not just about jobs. It’s also about our healthcare. You know, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are planning a government takeover of healthcare. Kamala Harris was the original co-sponsor of Bernie Sanders’ socialist Medicare for all. And Joe Biden added what’s called a public option to Obamacare that would send America on an inevitable path towards socialized medicine. President Trump and I, we’ve been working to give the American people better healthcare. We’ve lowered the cost of prescription drugs across the country. We expanded right to try for families to have access to life saving medicine. And we are going to have healthcare that protects preexisting conditions and lowers the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.\nMike Pence: (40:36)\nWe’re going to reform our healthcare system in a way that respects the doctor/patient relationship, is built on the power of the free market and makes sure that America will never be a socialist country on healthcare or in any other way. The truth is, when you look at their agenda, it’s clear, Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. Joe Biden says that democracy is on the ballot. The President and I believe that our economic recovery is on the ballot. Law and order are on the ballot. But I think there’s also things far more foundational to our nation that are on the ballot as well. You know, in this election I think it’s not so much whether we’re going to be more conservative or more liberal, whether it will be more Republican or more Democrat, more red or more blue. I think the choice in this election is whether America remains America.\nMike Pence: (42:00)\n… America. It’s whether we’re going to chart a course based on our highest ideals of freedom, free enterprise, personal responsibility, traditional values. Or whether we’re going to let Joe Biden, the Democratic party and the radical left take us on a leftward path towards socialism and decline. So let me say, all of you gathered here on this blustery day in Michigan, for our freedom and all the ideals that have always made America great, we need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States. We’re going to reelect president Donald Trump for four more years. So I need you to be out there, folks. I need you to tell your neighbors and friends what four more years means. And tell them you were over at Lacks Enterprises, you ran into Mike, standing in front of this beautiful flag. And I told you to tell them, “Four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means more support for our troops and our police.” And you tell them I said, “It’s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp.”\nMike Pence: (43:52)\nFolks, I’ve served alongside this president for the last three and a half years. I’ve only known him for about four. We’d met a few times before I met him on the campaign trail. Some people think we’re kind of different. But actually we’ve become very close friends. And I’ve served alongside him every day. And I can tell you that when the cameras are off, the bright lights are off, there’s not a day gone by that President Donald Trump hasn’t gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of Michigan. Now, it’s our turn to fight for him. It’s on, Michigan. We need to bring it. Okay.\nMike Pence: (44:49)\nSo I got to ask you to do a couple of things before I slip away. First and foremost, in the next 20 days, we’re on election day, I need you to vote, Michigan. Vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. I’m told early voting started on September 24th here in Michigan. If you don’t have plans tomorrow, you can actually head down to the Cascade Township clerks office. They’re open nine to one, 2865 Thorn Hills Avenue, Southeast, right here in Grand Rapids. And remember, friends don’t let friends vote alone. Bring a family member, bring a neighbor, bring a co-worker, and vote for four more years of President Donald Trump. Get it done.\nMike Pence: (45:56)\nAnd after you vote, I need you to do just like you’re doing today. I need you to go out and tell the story. I need you to bring the enthusiasm. Talk to your neighbors and friends at worship and work. Say, “You know what? I ran into Mike the other day at Lacks Enterprises. And that guy stood out there and talked for an hour, just summarizing everything that we got done and how this president has led us through this challenging time.” Tell them about the choice in this election. Lay out the stakes. Because honestly, I keep thinking about this time in the election four years ago, and all the polls back then, kind of like now, didn’t look so good, did they? I mean literally, we had a whole range of different pollings, one where we were losing by a lot and others where we were losing by a little.\nMike Pence: (46:58)\nBut I knew something else was going on. Because I was traveling around the country. I was seeing good people like you. I saw the tens of thousands of people that were coming out for our candidate. I’ve seen the hundreds of people that were coming out when I’d come into town. And I saw the determination on people’s faces. And I knew something was happening across the country. I knew that in some real sense, the American people were turning down the sound on all the experts and the pundits and the elites. And we were just talking to one another, weren’t we? And that’s what we need to be doing again, every day for the next 20 days. It’s great to be back in Grand Rapids because for the president and me, the campaign actually ended early in the morning on election day in Grand Rapids. Maybe some of you were there. Remember?\nMike Pence: (47:56)\nI mean, I was up at the podium right when it ticked us just right past midnight. And I looked at this little Timex watch. And I remember I leaned in and I said, “Welcome to election day, the day that Donald Trump’s going to be elected president of the United States.” And he was. And we had 20,000 people out after midnight. And when he arrived, he gave a talk from one in the morning until two in the morning. And the enthusiasm was incredible. But I’ll never forget what he said to me when he came off the stage. The crowd was thundering. It was two in the morning, early on election day. And he came walking off that stage. He slapped me on the shoulder and he said, “Mike, I don’t know about you, but this doesn’t look like second place.”\nMike Pence: (48:44)\nIt still doesn’t, Michigan. We’re going to deliver a win on November the third. But it’s going to take all of us to do it again. So I encourage you to do like you did before. Right after you vote, with a friend, do just like you did four years ago. Tell your neighbors and friends all that’s at stake. And lastly, I just say one more thing. And that is as I’ve traveled all across this country the last four years, I’ve come to two firm convictions. America is a freedom-loving nation. And America is a nation of faith. I mean, for all the time you turn on the television, like a question I got from a little girl at the end of the vice presidential debate, you turn on the TV and it seems like people are always arguing. It seems like there’s more division than ever before.\nMike Pence: (49:42)\nI truly do believe that there will always be more that unites us in this country than can ever divide us, and chief among those things is faith. And so I would just say to each one of you that if you’re inclined to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, I encourage you to do that too over the next 20 days. As we work to get out to vote, to tell the story, I just encourage you to remember those ancient words that Americans have clung to in much more challenging times. That if his people, who are called by his name, will humble themselves and pray and turn, he’ll do like he’s always done through the long and storied history of this nation. He’ll hear from Heaven and he’ll heal this land, this one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.\nMike Pence: (50:53)\nSo pray for America. Pray for all of the American people. And it’ll make a difference. So thank you all for coming out. Thank you for your enthusiasm. I got a plane to catch. And we’re going to take this message all across America. But I leave here today with renewed confidence that if all of us do all we need to do in the next 20 days, all across the state of Michigan and all across America, come November 3rd, we’re going to have a great victory. Great victory in the Wolverine state and all across America. With your continued support and prayers, we’re going to make Michigan and America more prosperous than ever before. We’re going to make Michigan and America safer than ever before. And with John James in the United States Senate, with Congressman Bill Huizenga and Peter Meyer, in a new Republican majority in the Congress, and with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, and with God’s help, we will make America great again. Again. Thank you all very much. God bless you. God bless America. Let’s go get it done.",

         "Speaker 1: (01:06)\nPlease welcome, Damian Ferguson.\nDamian Ferguson: (01:37)\nHello, Broward County. My name is Damian DeQuan Ferguson and I am 19 years old. I lived in Broward County for pretty much the majority of my life. I have two younger sisters, Destiny and Jayda and my mom’s name is Harmon and she’s a healthcare navigator. She’s also a single mom. To me, she’s the most hardest working, most determined person that I know. I go to school at Broward College, where I major in computer and information science and I work part-time with Student Life. I hope to be the first person in my family to have a college degree. I’m a regular guy. I like to play video games, have fun with my friends and spend time with my family. I also like to volunteer and help people when I can too.\nDamian Ferguson: (03:10)\nThis is not what I expected for my second year of college to look like at all. All my classes are virtual and I can’t do a lot of the same things that I used to enjoy with my friends and family. This election will be my first time voting. I got registered because I wanted to see change in my community and things aren’t headed in the right direction under the leadership of Donald Trump. I listened to this president and I can’t believe he doesn’t believe in climate change. It’s real and it’s happening in front of us. Whether it’s the fires in California or the flooding here in South Florida, this is not made up. My generation can’t wait to address the climate crisis.\nDamian Ferguson: (04:20)\nJoe Biden believes in science. He has a real plan for us to fight climate change while building a better future for all of us. I know that Joe cares about leaving a better future for me and all of the young people in this country. My mom, my sister and I, all have our vote by mail ballots at home. This week, we’ll be mailing them back to vote early, for Joe. Broward County, it is my honor to introduce the man who I’ll be casting my first ever vote for, our next president, Joe Biden.\nJoe Biden: (05:32)\nHello, Florida. Hello, hello, hello, hello, Florida. Miramar. It’s great to be back with you. Thank you so much and thank you, Mr. Mayor for the passport into your city and I want to say thank you to all the speakers you heard earlier. The Mayor, Dale, thank you. County Commissioner, Barbara and Senator Oscar. Look, Senator, you’re looking like you’re still in shape. And I also want to thank Damian for sharing your story and for exercising your power as a young voter, a first time voter.\nJoe Biden: (06:27)\nLook, you’re an inspiration, man. I really mean that. You’re making your family proud. You’re a role model for an awful lot of young people all across Florida and across the country. Folks, as my old football coach used to say, “It’s go time.” It is go time. It is. No matter whether it’s your first vote or many, but beyond that, this is the most important election in our lifetimes and you can make all the difference here in Florida. You can determine the outcome of this election.\nJoe Biden: (07:14)\nWe win Florida and it’s all over. Look, choice is clear and the stakes have never been higher. The stakes in this election remind me of something that my dad used to say. He said, “Joey, job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about your place in your community. It’s about you being able to look to your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, everything’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.”\nJoe Biden: (07:43)\nHow many people can look their kids in the eye and say that today, “It’s going to be okay,” and mean it? That’s the lesson I’ve never forgotten. That’s why I grew up surrounded by hardworking folks in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware but folks-\nJoe Biden: (08:01)\nFolks, these times are hard. These times are hard. Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic. The economic outlook for the next year remains uncertain, and across Florida and the country, folks are worried about being able to pay their rent or their next mortgage payment, whether or not they can purchase the prescription or put food on the table, worried about school and their kids. They see the people at the top doing better and better during this crisis, and wondering, “Who’s looking out for me?”\nJoe Biden: (08:39)\nFolks, that’s Donald Trump’s presidency: 115,000 dead from COVID-19. And experts say, unless we change rapidly, and he has shown no indication he’s willing to change or do the proper thing, we could lose another 200,000 lives the next few months, all because this president is only worried about the stock market, didn’t want to scare anybody. He refused to follow science. It’s established, it’s estimated that if, in fact, we all wore masks between now and January, we could save 100,000 lives over the next few months.\nJoe Biden: (09:29)\nFolks, what bothers me the most about this guy, in his own words, the president knew back in January, when he was briefed in detail, after lying about it, saying he never read the intelligence community’s warnings about how dangerous this was, what did he do? He learned in January, the end of January, and in fact, that in fact this was a virulent virus, that it was passed on easily, that it was airborne. But he didn’t tell anybody. He went on and tape an interview with Bob Woodward, a journalist, trying to ingratiate himself to him, telling him he knew how dangerous the disease was back in January. But he did nothing, not a single thing. Didn’t say a word to anybody. Ask yourself, why didn’t he tell the country? He said nothing. When he told Woodward, when Woodward asked him why he didn’t say anything, he said, “I didn’t want to panic the American people.” The American people do not panic; Donald Trump panicked! We don’t scare!\nJoe Biden: (10:47)\nAmericans have faced every problem that has ever confronted us, and his reckless personal conduct since the diagnosis has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump remains president, the more reckless he becomes. Three more weeks before we end this madness.\nJoe Biden: (11:10)\nFolks, the most respected doctor in the country on this issue is Dr. Fauci. He referred to the president’s announcement of the Supreme Court with a political event in the Rose Garden, or in the backyard of the White House, he called it a superspreading event. Look at all the people who became contagious and got ill. And how is he responding now? He, Trump, is running a national ad on television, you may have seen it, taking a quote of Dr. Fauci out of context. He said Dr. Fauci said way back in March, referring to the public health officials, he said, “I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more,” referring to the public health officials across America. Yet, the Trump campaign deliberately lied, making it as sound as if Fauci was talking about Trump. Fauci went public after the ad came out, saying, “I did not give permission for that quote, and it wasn’t referring to the president.”\nJoe Biden: (12:23)\nFolks, here’s the real point about the lack of ethics: even after Fauci said he didn’t say that about Trump, the Trump campaign said they’ll continue to use the ad knowing it was a lie. Folks, I don’t recall any administration, any presidential candidate in either major party doing anything like that.\nJoe Biden: (12:51)\nThat behavior’s no surprise, though. After all, this is the same man who looks at Americans who put their lives on the line for our nation and calls them losers and suckers. Folks, I carry with me a card, my schedule card, that lays out on the back my schedule. The last back page, in a black box I carried every day for the past 13 years, it says, “Daily troop updates. U.S. troops who died in Iraq and Afghanistan: 6,924.” Not around 6,900, 924, because every one of these fallen angels left behind an entire community. They deserve our respect.\nJoe Biden: (13:39)\n“Troops wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq: 53,194,” not 53,000 about. Folks, my son was one of those who volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, came home and he passed away. He was not a loser. He was an American hero. He won the Bronze Star, the [inaudible 00:14:05] Service Medal. And all his comrades left behind, they were patriots. Who the heck does this guy think he is?\nJoe Biden: (14:17)\nAnd now, as a consequence of this overwhelming line and misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are there around dinner tables tonight because of his negligence? How many husbands or wives at night lean over to touch and say good night to their wife or husband and they’re not there? How many people have holes in their heart and lost part of their soul? Debbie Ross and I talk about this. How can we have a guy like this?\nJoe Biden: (14:51)\nLadies and gentlemen, we’re so much better than this. Despite the crisis we face, we have an enormous opportunity to build this country back better. We’re the only nation in the world, with every crisis we’ve run into, we’ve ended up better off coming out of it than we were before we went in. That’s because America, there’s no quit in America. None! None!\nJoe Biden: (15:29)\nIt’s about time we start rewarding work, not wealth. To get everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead. For example, for communities of color in South Florida and all across this country, the question is how do we break the cycle where in good times you lag behind, and in bad times you get hit first and the hardest, and when recovery comes, you’re the last ones to bounce back? The answer is simple: justice.\nJoe Biden: (16:02)\n… back. The answer is simple, justice, criminal justice, police reform. I know the nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and our businesses that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning. We have no need for armed militias roaming American streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist, white supremacist groups marching on our communities.\nJoe Biden: (16:32)\nFolks, enough, I say we should trust American law enforcement authorities to do their job, as I do. Let them do their job without extremists and vigilantes. And if you say we have no need to face racial injustice in this country, you haven’t opened your eyes in America. There have been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months, I spent time with George Floyd’s family, his six year old daughter, Gianna, when I met with her, I knelt down to say hi to her and she looked at me and said, “Daddy changed the world. Daddy changed the world.” Also, Jacob Blake’s mother, who I got to know when she said, “The violence didn’t reflect her son and the nation needed healing,” and she prayed for the police.\nJoe Biden: (17:38)\nOr Doc Rivers, a basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung.” Went on to say, “It’s amazing why we keep loving this country, when this country does not love us back.” Think about that. Think about what it takes for a black person to love America. That’s a deep love for this country. That for far too long, has gone never fully recognized.\nJoe Biden: (18:13)\nWe need American leadership to seek out, to deescalate tensions, to open the lines of communication, to bring us together. Look, ladies and gentlemen, we have time… President to heal, heal to hope, as President I’ll do precisely what I will do.\nJoe Biden: (18:36)\nBut it’s also about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability, families of color building wealth and passing it down. That’s how we deliver equality and equity. For example, more and more women are dropping out of the workforce in this recession, whether in a city or out in the suburbs. We have a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly, tracing, testing, masking, not politicizing race for vaccines. Look, we have to get vaccines, not politicize it. And we have to plan for a safe and equitable distribution. We have to provide what as of today is not happening, funding for protective equipment, PPE, and other resources for hospital and frontline workers, so the schools can reopen safely. We got to ease the caregiving crisis that so many families experience, a squeeze of raising your kids and caring for an aged loved one. You got to protect your health care.\nJoe Biden: (19:45)\nIn the middle of this pandemic, why do the Republicans have time to hold a hearing to pack the court instead of providing significant economic relief and need for localities? I’ll tell you why. It’s about wiping out the Affordable Care Act, to wipe it off the books. Because their nominee has said in the past, that the law should be struck down. That will take away health care for 20 million Americans. It will take protections away from pre-existing conditions for over a hundred million people. And by the way, kids won’t be able to stay in their parent’s health insurance until they’re 26.\nJoe Biden: (20:34)\nComplications of COVID-19 like lung scarring, heart damage, will become the next pre-existing condition. We’ll toss out, toss out the coverage for so many children. It will take us backwards to when insurance companies could charge a woman, many of you won’t remember this, but charge a woman more for her healthcare than a man, just because she’s a woman for the same procedure. Folks, we can do so much better than this. Together, we’ll build on the Affordable Care Act. By adding a new health insurance option, a not-for-profit option, to give private insurers a real competitor. We’ll increase subsidies to premiums and lower cost to get more coverage, lower deductibles, lower out-of-pocket expenses. And by the way, anybody, anybody who qualifies for Medicare, but lives in a state like your governor that doesn’t allow for 800,000 people to have it, will automatically be enrolled. It’s wrong.\nJoe Biden: (21:54)\nBut we can only do this, if we come as a country. Last week, I went to Gettysburg, the battlefield in Pennsylvania. Abraham Lincoln, to make a point, we’re in trouble. Abraham Lincoln said there, that a house divided cannot stand. Today, trust is ebbing, hope is elusive. Instead of healing, we’re being ripped apart. And I refuse to let that happen. When I announced, when I was running, I said I was running, one of the reasons was to unite America and I was made fun of. They said, “You can’t do that anymore. You used to be able to do it, Joe. You can’t do it now.” But the only way democracy can function is with consensus. Otherwise, it becomes semi-dictatorial like this guys trying to be.\nJoe Biden: (23:02)\nLook, we need to revive the spirit of bipartisan in the country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that I’m told that that was fine, Joe. You used to be able to do that, but you can’t do it anymore. Well, I’m here to tell you, we can, we must, and we’re going to get it done.\nJoe Biden: (23:29)\nLook, I’m running as a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American President. I’ll work for Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work for those who vote against me, as hard as those who voted for me. That’s the job of a President, to heal. It’s a duty to care, to care for every…\nJoe Biden: (24:03)\nIt’s a duty to care, to care for everyone. Look, folks, and you too have a sacred duty. As my friend, John Lewis, who recently passed away would say, “It’s a sacred obligation to vote. And it matters.” Florida matters. You elected me and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. And I’m asking for your trust and support again in 2020 for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.\nJoe Biden: (24:33)\nBecause, folks, I promise you, I promise you, we will always have your back. I promise you. I give you my word. So, please vote, and help us get out the vote. It’s been mentioned before to go to iwillvote.com/fl. You can still request your vote by mail ballot and do it as soon as you can. If you haven’t already mailed yours and you have one, mail it, or drop it in a box today, drop box today. You can also vote in person starting October 19th here in Broward County where this election will be determined.\nJoe Biden: (25:41)\nFolks, the country needs you. Tell everyone you know, everyone you meet, to vote no matter what. Don’t let anyone discourage you or tell you your voice won’t count. It does. It will. You are the American people, and you will decide our future, not Trump. So, vote. Folks.\nSpeaker 2: (26:10)\nWe love you [inaudible 00:26:17].\nJoe Biden: (26:16)\nThank you. As my friend, the Congresswoman, Debbie knows, I hadn’t planned on running this time. My son had passed away, and I was working as a professor, and I thought, “Enough.” But then, when I saw those people coming out of the fields in Charlottesville, my word, carrying torches, close your eyes. Remember what you saw. Their veins bulging, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile, carrying Nazi insignias that were carried and chanted in Germany, in the 30s. Accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacists, David Duke, the grand [preagle 00:27:09] saying, “This is why we elected him.”\nJoe Biden: (27:14)\nAnd then a young woman protesting was killed. They went to the president of United States and they said, “Mr. President, what do you think?” Here’s what he said. Something no president in American history has ever said, ” There were very fine people on both sides.” God almighty.\nJoe Biden: (27:39)\nThat’s when I realized, and I said at the time, we’re literally in a battle for the soul of this country, for our decency, our honor, our compassion, who we are. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are great. Folks, we’ve never fully lived up to that. We’ve never walked away from it. Every generation has opened the aperture wider. This is the first president ever that’s flat walked away from it.\nJoe Biden: (28:10)\nIt’s time to restore America’s soul. It’s time to rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class. It’s time to bring everybody along. No matter your race, your age, your gender, your ethnicity, your sexual orientation, or your disability. It’s time to unite America. And we’ll do that by choosing hope over fear. By choosing science over fiction, truth over lies, and unity over division.\nJoe Biden: (28:42)\nThere’s nothing beyond the capacity of this nation when we stand together. So it’s time to stand up, take back this democracy. When I was a kid and John Kennedy said, “We’re going to the moon.” Everybody remembers. We all had to learned what he said about that, the speech. There’s one line and it always used on the Senate floor when I was a Senator. My colleges would kid me.\nJoe Biden: (29:08)\nAnd he answered the unasked question, “Why are we doing this?” He said, “Because I refuse to postpone.” I refuse to postpone one more day this president’s irresponsible action. So let’s get up. Let’s take back this country. Show the world who we are. May God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",

         "President Trump: (01:02)\nHello, Johnstown. Thank you very much. This is going to be a great evening. Incredible to be back in Pennsylvania, the proud home of American independence, the American constitution and American freedom. That’s true. Huh? What a history. And 21 days days from now, we’re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins, all these other countries win. We get ripped off by everybody. If we win, you win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins, very simple. For years, the selfish and corrupt political class betrayed the people of Pennsylvania, you know that, and the people of our country. Career politicians like Joe Biden lied to you. I don’t think he knew he was even lying. You want to know the truth. He’s gone. He’s shot folks. I hate to tell you, he’s shot. He abused you, he crushed you, your dreams and outsourced your jobs to China and distant lands all over the world.\nPresident Trump: (02:14)\nAs a Senator Biden’s last American trade policies were a total disaster. They dismantled your steel industry and decimated entire towns in your area. And we brought back steel and we put tariffs on steel and we stopped dumping steel and aluminum. As vice-president, he closed down 10,000 factories while raking in cash from corporations that moved jobs overseas, and his family got rich. You know that.\nPresident Trump: (02:48)\nHow did Hunter make three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Russia, mayor of Moscow’s wife? How did that happen? So you have the mayor of Moscow, got a wife, gave Hunter three and a half million bucks. I wonder what he did for that money, huh? The fake news, they refused to talk about it. They don’t want to hear about it.\nPresident Trump: (03:09)\nBiden’s a servant of the radical globalist, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests, who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories and you know it, because you really suffered right in this area, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these ridiculous, endless foreign wars. They’re all coming back home. Don’t worry. They’re all coming back home, soon. They’re already on their way. They’ve been on their way for a long time.\nPresident Trump: (03:42)\nIn 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this failed and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as your president to finally put America first. That’s what we did. And we did not come this far, overcome this much, and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the depraved, Washington swamp. And by the way, did we catch them? We caught them. We caught them. We caught them. Watch what happens. Watch what happens. They spied on our campaign. What they did should never, ever be allowed to happen in this country again, never. Watch what happens. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control to the socialists and Marxists and left-wing extremists like his vice presidential candidate. That’s another great one, isn’t it?\nPresident Trump: (04:52)\nI just watched her on television coming in, because the great thing about Air Force One, we have more televisions. They’re in closets. They’re all over the place. They’re on the floors, on the ceilings. And I watched her and I compared her to Amy, great future Supreme court justice. And I will tell you Amy’s made a great impression.\nCrowd: (05:18)\nFill that seat. Fill that seat. Fill that seat.\nPresident Trump: (05:29)\nAnd you know, Biden, he can’t stand up to the lunatics running his party. He can’t even find his way off the stage without them. Look what’s happened. Yesterday, he didn’t know the name. He said, “You know the guy, I think he’s a Mormon, right”” He said, “He’s a Mormon.” He was talking about Mitt Romney. He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine. Then he didn’t know where he was. He said, “Where the hell am I? Where am I?” No, he’s shot folks. He’s shot.\nPresident Trump: (05:58)\nI’m running against the single worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. And you know what that does? That puts more pressure on me. Can you imagine if you lose to a guy like this? It’s unbelievable. It’s disgusting. It’s disgraceful. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country. He won’t be running the country. The radical left will take over.\nPresident Trump: (06:22)\nAnd how about Pennsylvania? So he says, “There will be no fracking, no fracking.” This went on for a year and a half. No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. Then Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So they stole another one for Bernie. Bernie is the greatest loser of them all. This guy, every four years they steal it. So she refused to get out, Pocahontas. She refused to get out. They wanted me to apologize for saying the word Pocahontas. So no, no. I apologize to Pocahontas, [inaudible 00:06:52]. No, no, she wouldn’t get out. And she took enough votes away and Biden won super Tuesday. That shouldn’t have happened.\nPresident Trump: (07:03)\nBut if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, fortunately that’s because I’m not a politician. I’m not a politician. But think of that, you talk about politician, no fracking for a year and a half, right? And then he goes to Pennsylvania says, “No, no, there’ll be fracking.” Like nothing happened. Can you imagine if I did that? No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. I’m the opposite, by the way. No fracking, no fracking. Then you win and you go, I’ve got to go a little to the other direction, a little bit to the right. Although he actually went further to the left, which is sort of an amazing thing, but all of a sudden he comes out in favor of fracking.\nPresident Trump: (07:42)\nAnd let me tell you, it’s always the first thing that turns out to be true. Okay. They will lose, you will lose, in Pennsylvania a million jobs. There will be no petroleum products. There will be no fracking whatsoever. And did you see his party now is really angry at him because he’s saying maybe there’ll be fracking. It’s a very conditional, it’s a very weak, but with me, you’re going to frack. You’re going to frack. And you’re going to keep your energy low. And we’re independent, we are now energy independent, first time ever.\nPresident Trump: (08:16)\nSo if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you. And I fought harder for you than any president has ever fought for their people. Right now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. And that’s a big thing, saving it, because these people, this will end up being a large scale version of Venezuela, if they get in. They don’t have water. They don’t have medicine. They don’t have food. They don’t have anything. Despite everything they’ve thrown at us, we’ve done more in the first three and a half years than any administration in history. And the best is yet to come. That’s true.\nPresident Trump: (09:06)\nA recent Gallup poll just came out.\nCrowd: (09:08)\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years.\nPresident Trump: (09:21)\nThank you. A Gallup poll just came out that found that 56% of Americans say they’re better off today than they were under Sleepy Joe and Obama. That’s the highest of any president at this point in his term. Let’s think of that, 56%. This is as we round the corner on the pandemic, 56%. they were much, much lower. Just remember this, if they were any good I wouldn’t have run for president, but they were no good. They did a horrible job. They did a horrible job.\nPresident Trump: (09:56)\nYesterday, Biden told those 56% of Americans that they probably shouldn’t vote for him. And for once I agree with Joe. Did you hear? He said, “You shouldn’t vote for me.” He has no idea what he’s saying. How the hell do you lose to a guy like this? Is this possible. Oh, I’ll never come to Pennsylvania again. I love this place. They say he was born in Scranton, but he left. He left. He abandoned you. Give me a break.\nCrowd: (10:27)\nWe love you. We love you. We love you.\nPresident Trump: (10:34)\nThank you.\nCrowd: (10:34)\nWe love you.\nPresident Trump: (10:34)\nI love you, too.\nCrowd: (10:34)\nWe love you. We love you. We love you.\nPresident Trump: (10:38)\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, there’s a lot of people here tonight. Got a lot of people. I wish the fake news would show it. They never turn the cameras. I go home, our great first lady always says, “How was the crowd?” I said, “Didn’t they show it?” “No, they just show your face.” And about five people behind me, right? They become famous. Why don’t you show the crowd though? Why don’t you do yourself a favor, show the crowd.\nPresident Trump: (11:18)\nOne of the most important issues for Pennsylvania is the survival of your fracking industry. Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to abolish fracking. He’s a liar. Okay. He’s a liar. How do you do it? How do you do it? He went for a year and a half. They said, “Are you…” remember the debates with the radical left Democrats? You had Alfred E Newman. You had all these people, you know who Alfred E. Newman is? Yes. Pete Buttigieg, Pete Buttigieg, he was a bad mayor of a failed town and he’s going to run for president. Pete Buttigieg, but you know he’s talking about it. And does that mean everybody, nobody is going to do fracking? That’s right. Nobody. Nobody, I swear. Nobody, nobody, nobody. Then he gets up, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life, and not one fake reporter back there said, “Well, wait a minute, you’ve been pledging for a year and a half, no fracking.”\nPresident Trump: (12:14)\nBut then what about the healthcare for illegal immigrants? Who in this group is going to provide healthcare for illegal immigrants? Everybody raises their hand. You remember Joe? No, do you remember? This is a famous clip, but they don’t ask him questions about it because they’re fake. You remember Joe? Who is going to provide… And look, we all have hearts and we want to take care of everybody. But you know the problem when you do that, we don’t have the money. The whole world is going to empty out into our country. They’re going to come for healthcare. They’re going to come for college, free college. I say sometimes jokingly sarcastically, “Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce.” To which CNN says, “They don’t get a free Rolls-Royce. He has misrepresented.”\nPresident Trump: (12:57)\nThese people are sick.\nCrowd: (13:07)\nCNN sucks. CNN Sucks. CNN sucks. CNN Sucks. CNN sucks. CNN Sucks.\nPresident Trump: (13:08)\nEverybody gets a free Rolls-Royce. They don’t get a free Rolls-Royce. The president has misrepresented. They are sick people. But think of it, so remember when Joe and they said, “Raise your hand if everybody’s in favor of free, everything, credit free everything, but free healthcare for illegal aliens.” And Joe goes like, he had no idea what the hell he was doing, folks. He has no clue. And he’s not a nice guy. Just so you understand, not a nice guy. If he was a nice guy, I wouldn’t hit him like this, but he’s not a nice guy. He’s a bad guy. He’s always been a dummy. He’s never been… No, no. In his best of years, he was considered a dumb guy. When asked about fracking, Biden said he “would sure, absolutely make it. We will eliminate it.” That’s what he said. Those are the exact words. And then he said it 19 different times.\nPresident Trump: (14:04)\nThen one day he said, “I never said that.” It’s incredible. And they don’t question him. I couldn’t get away with it for a minute, not for a minute. Did you see the town hall he had with NBC? That was a town hall for a child, a young child. Barron Trump, and actually Barron’s far too advanced for that town hall. That was a town hall, Lester Holt, Lester Holt. That was a beauty, right? That was some town hall. And they said, “Yes, we have a random sampling of people.” Yeah. All Trump haters. What a group of people. But he raised his hand. He said, “Illegal immigrants will get healthcare.” Now people don’t realize what that means. That means your social security goes down the tubes, your country goes bankrupt. The whole thing is a disaster, but he raised his hand. Now he’s trying to say he didn’t do it. And they don’t call him out because they’re fake.\nPresident Trump: (15:04)\nHis radical left running mate, who I just watched on television, she is so pathetic, is a co-sponsor of the socialist green new deal, which eliminates all fossil fuels. She’s having a hard time getting out of that one. Did you hear the other day? She actually came out in favor of fracking. It was like, “Yeah, I think so.” She’s further left than Bernie. Did you see Bernie, I thought was the furthest left in the Senate, because you don’t get too much worse. Then you go, instead of socialists, you go to the C-word, right? She’s further left. She’s considered further left than Bernie. When Nancy Pelosi does the 25th amendment, she’s doing it for Biden. You do know that, right? Because they want to get Biden out and that won’t be hard. But at this very moment, Biden’s website includes a pledge to mandate net zero carbon emissions, which means fossil fuel, coal, everything is gone and it’s gone soon. Okay.\nPresident Trump: (16:09)\nAnd with that goes our economy, and with that goes our country. The Democrat party hates fracking. They hate coal. They hate clean, beautiful coal. I see what they do with coal now. They hate domestic energy production and Biden will shut you down. He wants to shut you down just like your governor’s got you shut down right now. They better open up your state. Did you see the World Health Organization yesterday? They said Trump was right. They said you can’t make the cure worse than the problem itself. I’ve been saying that for a long time. And we did the right thing. We saved 2 million lives. They said 2.2 million people. We saved 2 million lives and we get nothing, and I’ll tell you what, the vaccines are coming soon, the therapeutics and frankly, the cure. All I know is I took something, whatever the hell it was, I felt good very quickly. I don’t know what it was. Antibodies, antibodies. I don’t know. I took it. I said, I felt like Superman. And I said, “Let me at them.” No, and I could have been here four or five days ago. It’s great. We have great doctors.\nPresident Trump: (17:22)\nI want to thank the doctors at Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins, great doctors. One great thing about being president, if you’re not feeling 100%, you have more doctors than you thought existed in the world. I was surrounded with 14 of them. Where are you from? “I’m from this one.” Where are you from? “I’m from Johns Hopkins.” “I’m from Walter Reed.” But what great talented people. They did a great job and thank you. And while I’m president, America will remain the world’s number one energy producer with Pennsylvania workers leading the way and that’s what’s happening. You’re leading the way.\nPresident Trump: (18:00)\nYou’re leading [inaudible 00:00:18:00].\nPresident Trump: (18:04)\nYou know, you had the best year in the history of your place. It’s a history of … if you look at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you never want to say state. Don’t ever say state. Actually, nobody cares but them, but you know.\nPresident Trump: (18:18)\nI’m just saying, let’s say Pennsylvania, you got two of them. You know that, right? The Commonwealth, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I went to school here. Probably spent more time here than sleepy Joe in all fairness, I went to school here. But we’re putting our great coal miners back to work. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments. You see that happening. And we’ve got … Did you see in the debate the other night, I said to him, “Name one law enforcement agency, just one in a whole country that supports you.” He couldn’t do it. Then Chris Wallace bailed him out. Then I say, “How come you got the three and a half million from Russia?” And they bailed him out again. He was choking like a dog. They bailed him out.\nPresident Trump: (19:02)\nBut they want to dissolve your borders. They don’t want borders. They want to have open borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes, confiscate your guns, get rid of your Second Amendment.\nPresident Trump: (19:16)\nI mean, here’s one that’s incredible, destroy your suburbs. Okay, so they talk about the suburban women. And somebody said, “I don’t know if the suburban woman likes you.” I say, “Why?” But we had this … I love you too.\nPresident Trump: (19:34)\nThey said, “They may not like the way you talk,” but I’m about law and order. I’m about having you safe. I’m about having your suburban communities. I don’t want to build low-income housing next to your house. Okay, if that’s okay? And I ended the regulation, the rule that made the zoning so impossible that you had to destroy your communities. And then I hear the suburban woman. I think that the suburban woman, and I used to say suburban housewife, I used to take heat, but I said, “Does anybody care?” Do you care? If I say suburb? No, they’re all going to no. Again, the only one cares is them. “Trump said suburban housewife,” but I didn’t say it because I don’t. You learn very quickly. You learn very quickly. But suburban women, they should like me more than anybody here tonight because I ended the regulation that destroyed your neighborhood. I ended the regulation that brought crime to the suburbs and you’re going to live the American dream. And that’s what you’re going to do.\nPresident Trump: (20:31)\nAnd remember this, 29% of the people experiencing the American dream in the suburbs happened to be minority. And you don’t know that. But 29%. and we’re doing this for everybody. We’re not doing it one way or the other. We’re doing it. And I ended it. They said, “Sir, we can amend it.” I said, “I don’t want to amend it. I want to end it.” It was a horror show. And this loser, Corey Booker is the guy that’s going to be in charge of the program. The guy’s a stone-cold loser. 1%, he got 1%. He ran. He was going to be great. You know, 1%. every week he was like her, down, down, down. They should’ve picked him. But no he’ll be in charge of you’re a suburban …\nPresident Trump: (21:10)\nSo can I ask you to do me a favor, suburban women, will you please like me? Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, okay? The other thing I don’t have that much time to be that nice. You know, I can do it, but I got to go quickly. We don’t have time. They want me to be politically correct. Yes, let’s discuss it. Let’s talk about it over the next 10 years. No, no, no, no. We saved suburbia in the US. I got rid of a regulation that was a disaster. And it was very unfair. And you’ve been reading about it for a long time. It’s been going on for a long time. It became much worse under Obama and Biden. I got rid of it. And I had a choice. Even my own people said, “You’d never get rid of it, sir.” I said, “I want to get rid of it.” “Well, why don’t we just amend it?” I said, “I don’t want to amend it. I want to get rid of it.” Get rid of it. Okay?\nPresident Trump: (22:06)\nAnd I think we’re going to see that the women really like Trump a lot. That’s happened last time. Remember? Remember last four years ago? Four years ago, they said women will never vote for him. I said, “Why, am I so bad?” They said, “The women will never vote.” Then I got 52%. They said, “What the hell happened with the women?” Except this time, see, this is much easier. Because then I was a developer, I was doing great, everything was nice, but I had never done this before. I came in, I said, “I’m going to rebuild our military. I’m going to cut your taxes. I’m going to cut your regulations. I’m going to get you this, I’m going to get you that. I’m going to take care of our vets.”\nPresident Trump: (22:42)\nI mean, I did things that frankly, I never even talked about like space force. I never talked about space force. The wall is almost built. You know, the wall is up to 392 miles. It’s almost built. And Mexico is paying for the wall by the way, you know that. I’ve been saying it. They hate to hear that, but they’re paying. We’re putting a charge on where the cars go through and it will more than pay for the wall. But we have now the most secure Southern border that we’ve ever had. And I want to thank the president of Mexico. They 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border, stopping people from coming into the US illegally. Thank you very much.\nPresident Trump: (23:24)\nNo, but we did all these things. So this time in theory, it should be easier. But don’t forget, I’ve gone through years of a fake witch hunt. And now it turned out that they were the guilty party. They were the ones dealing with Russia. They were the guilty people. Think if I didn’t have every night on that fake CNN, right over there with the light on. The light just went off. It just went off. Every time I point to them, the light goes off. It’s all right, keep it off. Nobody’s watching them anyway.\nPresident Trump: (23:56)\nBut think if I didn’t have every night, Russia, Russia, Russia, hey. And nobody’s been tougher on Russia than me. What I’ve done for NATO. Raised $130 billion a year from other countries that weren’t paying their bills. They were delinquent, as we said in the real estate business. They were delinquent. And that goes up to $410 billion. Nobody did that. Obama used to send them pillows maybe from the pillow man on Fox. Did you ever see a man advertised so much? I’ve never seen it. I’ve never seen the biggest advertising … I think he’s the greatest advertising genius, Mike. If I gave him our budget, you wouldn’t be able to do anything else but watch Trump ads. The pillow, man. I tell you, I never saw so many ads in my life. Every day, it’s a pillow, the pillow. Now he came out with a sheet and I’m going crazy. That’s all we need now is a new sheet. But he’s on our side too by the way, that guy, he’s on our side, Mike.\nPresident Trump: (24:57)\nAnd now Biden even refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. You know, elections have consequences. Winning and losing an election, that’s big consequences. And we’ve been winning elections. And they say, “Well, you know, Trump shouldn’t be appointing the new justice because …” well, I’m president. In fact, as you know, a lot of your great justices said, “No, no they’re appointed.” Justice Ginsburg just said recently, not so long ago, “No, no. He’s a president for four years. Not for three years. You appoint …” Now, she was referring to Obama, I think, or Clinton or somebody. But wasn’t referring to me, I can promise you that.\nPresident Trump: (25:44)\nOh, don’t worry. Don’t worry. It’s being filled. You don’t have to worry about that. That’s much easier than we’ll build a wall that goes to … that goes for a lot. You know, the wall is one of the biggest projects in the history of this country. You know that right? And we had a party dedicated to the proposition that there will never, ever be a wall. They know was the right thing to do. And I made one big mistake. I should’ve come instead of saying, “We will build a wall,” I should have said, “We will never, ever build a wall.” They would have given me so much money. Made a big mistake. All great congressman over there. Are you guys having a good time, by the way? Huh, Mike?\nPresident Trump: (26:22)\nHe said the voters don’t deserve to know. And they’ll tell you after the election what he’s going to do. And you know what I did, I gave you a list. I have 45 people on that list. Every one of them is a star. And I gave you a list. Yeah, sit down, everybody. Just enjoy yourself. What the hell? Look at these people. I didn’t even realize you’re all standing. I didn’t realize you had seats. You’re lucky. This is one of the few crowds we provided seats. That’s because it’s Pennsylvania, I guess. It’s pretty good.\nPresident Trump: (26:56)\nIf they win, Democrats will pack the Supreme Court with radical left justices who will shred your Second Amendment. You can forget about guns, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals and terrorists. To defend our constitution from this madness, I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Supreme Court and to the court. She’ll be a great justice of the United States Supreme Court. She’s done so well. I really found it fascinating today. I don’t have too much time, but I tried to watch as much as I could. She was great.\nPresident Trump: (27:32)\nThe radical left is hellbent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They’re enraged and unhinged. And they are going crazy. Think of it, very many presidents never have anybody to appoint. I will have by the end of the first term, almost 300 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices. Their heads are exploding. I hope they’re happy.\nPresident Trump: (28:02)\nThey want to cancel you, shame you, and persecute you. That’s what they want to do. They want to shame. And this whole cancel culture thing. Now they’re after Abraham Lincoln. They don’t like Abraham Lincoln. No, he wasn’t too good was he? I said this three years ago. Remember when they took down a couple of statues of people you’d never heard of? A Confederate soldier, somebody else, somebody … I said, “Oh, really? Then next will be Robert E. Lee. Then next will be Abraham Lincoln. Then next will be George Washington.” And everybody laughed. They said, “Oh, the president is so funny.” I said, “I’m not being funny. These people are sick.” These people, they want to take away your heritage. And by the way, are there any Italians in the room?\nPresident Trump: (28:43)\nOkay, well, we are protecting the legacy of Christopher Columbus. The Italians are tough. I love the Italians. So they were going to rip down the statue of Christopher Columbus in New York. You saw that, right? And all of a sudden, a group of Italian circled around the statue and they were having pretty tough things in their hand, I must say. And it was amazing how those people that wanted to rip it down disappeared very quickly. So the Italians, let me tell you, Christopher Columbus will always be here on my watch, that I can tell you.\nPresident Trump: (29:21)\nI had people the other day that wanted to wish me Happy Columbus Day. They were afraid. I said, “Why are you ashamed? No, no, say it. Happy Christopher Columbus Day.” This is Christopher Columbus Day. It’s Columbus Day.” So Italians say, “Thank you Mr. President.” I appreciate it. I like you too. I love the Italians. They want to punish the middle-class, expunged every last trace of traditional values, and replace the American dream with the socialist nightmare. And that’s what would happen. Just take a look at what’s going on in other parts of the world.\nPresident Trump: (29:52)\nBiden’s agenda, not that he has one, but you know. He does whatever they tell him to do. He got so lucky. She should have gotten out. She was faithful, she would have gotten out. Bernie would have run. We would have been running against crazy Bernie instead. But I’d rather run against Joe because there’s no enthusiasm. There’s no energy. One thing with Bernie’s people … And you know, we got a lot of people last time from Bernie because they loved me on trade, because they know our country has been ripped off on trade like no country has ever been ripped off. And Bernie’s people get that. And they like us on trade.\nPresident Trump: (30:27)\nBiden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare. Nobody remembers that. And the press will never bring it up. But he tried to cut your social security. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal health care for the illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your social security. Biden cares more about illegal aliens than he cares about your senior citizens and it’s true. And let me just tell you this. And I say it strongly, and when I first got elected, they always played the social security card. And nothing happened. Your social security now is better than ever. I haven’t touched it. While I am president, no one will touch your Medicare or your social security. Under my leadership, we’re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that’s what we want. Normal life. We want normal life. We’ll fully resume. And next year will be one of the greatest economic years in the history of our country. It’s already happening.\nPresident Trump: (31:40)\nHow about the stock market? Who has 401ks in the audience? Well, I can tell you one thing, I’m getting all of your votes. I’m getting your votes. Your 401ks is setting records. Think of it, as we’re rounding the turn and we are, they go crazy when I say we’re rounding the turn on the pandemic. We understand it. Hey, I just had it. Here I am. It’s actually me.\nPresident Trump: (32:01)\nAnd I could’ve stayed in the basement of the White House or maybe the top floor of the White House. I could have done that, but I’m the president of the United States. I can’t do that. I got to get out and I have to meet people and I have to see people. And I know it’s risky to do that, but you have to do what you have to do. I’m the president. I can’t sit in the basement and say, “Let’s wait this thing out.” I’m not going to do that. And now I’m immune, they tell me I’m immune. I could come down and start kissing everybody. I’ll kiss every guy, man and woman, man and woman. Look at that guy, how handsome he is. I’ll kiss him. Not with all of enjoyment, but that’s okay.\nPresident Trump: (32:42)\nJoe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate the economy with draconian, unscientific lockdowns, like you’re having right now in Pennsylvania with this governor who is killing you. Tom Wolf, Tom Wolf. Come on, Tom. Open up Pennsylvania, Tom. Open it up. You know what’s going to happen? November 4th, they’ll open it up. You know that? They want to keep the numbers as bad as possible.\nPresident Trump: (33:15)\nHere’s the problem. The numbers are going to come out just before the election. So we have November 3rd, the numbers are going to come out. And Pennsylvania is a late voting state. You actually believe in going to a poll because you see all the shenanigans. No, you’re a late voting state. And all I can tell you is when I came here and I said this before, but when I came here, I promise you a lot of things. I’ve done much more than I promised you. You’ve had the best year you’ve ever had, and you’re going to have a better year next year. You damn well better vote for me, Pennsylvania. You better vote for me.\nPresident Trump: (33:53)\nSleepy Joe Biden’s plan will crush America. And my plan, we’re going to crush the virus very quickly. It’s happening already. It’s happening. Almost 90% less mortality. You know, the mortality rate is at like 85. If you had it seven or eight months ago, it was not as good as if you have it now. And soon it’s going to be perfecto. And I said that the drug that they gave me, we’re going to be distributing it all over the country to hospitals and everything else, because I’ll tell you that sucker works. That’s my opinion. What do I know? But to me it works.\nPresident Trump: (34:29)\nAnd the people that did it. They’re phenomenal people. They’ve had great success with other vaccines and drugs. Just this week, we learned that another member of the Biden family is getting rich off connections to Joe. His son-in-law, just came out, big story, is cashing in on the China virus pandemic, just like Hunter. Where’s Hunter? Crashed in on China. What do you think when Hunter walks in and he walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage for China. I said to a friend of mine, one of the biggest guys on Wall Street, “Does that ever happened?” He said, “I’m the biggest guy on Wall Street. That doesn’t happen for me.” 10 minutes, he had a billion and a half dollars. Maybe he’s not so stupid after all.\nPresident Trump: (35:10)\nTo fight the China virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. And we really should get credit for what we’ve done, because I’ll tell you Mike pats and all of these people, they have worked 24 hours around the clock. Our early and aggressive action saved as many as 2 million lives. Remember when they said, “No, no, no. You don’t want to ban China. Don’t ban China.” I did it in January. They were talking a month and a half later, we shouldn’t be doing it. He called me xenophobic.\nPresident Trump: (35:38)\nI said, “Joe, give me a definition of xenophobic, please.” He was unable to do that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies and reduced the fatality rate by 85%. I’m working with the FDA to make the antibody treatments I received. And everybody … we’re going to have them. They’re going to be shipped very soon. We’re working on an emergency use authorization, very complicated stuff. And the …\nPresident Trump: (36:03)\nUse authorization, very complicated stuff, and the FDA has never responded like they’ve responded to me. This could have taken years what we’ve done and we’ve done it in weeks. I know they came to me on one thing and they said, “Sir, well that will take approximately two and a half years.” I said, “No, it’s no good.” “When do you need it, sir?” “Next week? Tomorrow? How about tomorrow?” No, we’re pushing them hard. The FDA has been great. To everyone fighting to recover from the virus, I feel your pain because I felt your pain and we will beat this virus together. Who has had it? Who has had it here? Who’s had it? Yeah. A lot of people, a lot of people. Well, you’re the people I want to say hello to because you are right now immune. You are right now immune.\nPresident Trump: (36:49)\nOr they say that. You know, they hate to admit it because I had it. So in the old days they said, “Well, if you have it, you’re immune for life,” right? Once I got it, they give you four months. It’s anybody else but me, you’re immune for life. Through operation warp speed, which is incredible, we’ll have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, 100 million, and the vaccine will end the pandemic once and for all.\nPresident Trump: (37:16)\nAnd remember this because I have the endorsement of, I think, every major law enforcement and minor law enforcement group in the country. We have a lot of Democrats that left their party and they came over, law enforcement people. I can almost tell you by looking. Look at this group over here. I know the law enforcement people. Nobody’s been better. We had all this surplus military equipment. Obama didn’t want to give it out because he said it looked too militaristic. I said, “No, I want to save lives. Okay?” It’s defensive equipment. I want to save lives. And we gave out hundreds of millions of… It was sitting in warehouses all over the country, military equipment, and we gave it out. But there’s nobody like the great men and women of law enforcement. Nobody.\nPresident Trump: (38:06)\nLook at that. Whoa. Whoa. See? They love you. See that? Wow. I didn’t expect that. That’s pretty good.\nAudience: (38:16)\nUSA! USA! USA! USA!\nPresident Trump: (38:25)\nThat’s great. But this election is about law and order. You look at Portland. We keep saying to the governor, “Look, governor, Oregon.” I said, “Governor, let us go in. We’ll solve the problem in 30 minutes.” They don’t want to do that. You know, they’re supposed to ask you to come in. We did a great job in Minnesota, Minneapolis, except you know, instead of 10 days, they could have called us like two hours later. But they came in and they lined up and they were not socially distanced. They lined up. You saw that. They came in wearing black uniforms, 250, 000 and most expensive uniforms. I never saw so many computers on a helmet. But they went in and they had their tear gas and they had their pepper spray, which the other side doesn’t want us to use anymore. They said, “No, we don’t want to do that.”\nPresident Trump: (39:14)\nThese people are a lot of bad people out there. You know, they’re anarchists, radical, left anarchists. Okay? So they came in. They came in. You saw it. There was one person. I said, “Where are the rest?” Then another one. Then another one. Then they started getting off buses, wherever. All of a sudden, you had one line, two line, and they just started moving forward. That was the end of the problem. It ended within 30 minutes. It was over. It was over. And we’ll do it wherever they want us. We’d love to go into Portland because those guys are bad news. You saw we sent in the U.S. Marshals, right? Because one man, horrible guy, shot somebody right through the head, shot him in the middle of the street. A guy who wasn’t hurting anybody. He killed him. Two days went by. Three days went by. I said, “Why the hell haven’t they arrested him?” And they knew who he was. And we sent in the U.S. Marshals. And in 15 minutes it was all over. That was the end of it. That was the end of it.\nPresident Trump: (40:12)\nBiden Harris and the Democrat party declared war on our police. Okay? And we’ve proudly received the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association. Wow. The Fraternal Order of Police including those in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton and virtually every single police organization that we know.\nPresident Trump: (40:45)\nAnd during the debate, I asked sleepy Joe, I said, “ive me one organization, law enforcement, that’s endorsing you.” And he couldn’t do it. Then Chris Wallace saved him. Then I said, remember I said, ” Sir, tell me, say the words law and order. Say it, Joe. Say it.” He couldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. Because you know what? Because he’d been run out of his party if he said the words law and order. Then I think at the end, didn’t he say like law, and order, and safety, and justice, and you know, all the stuff. No, no. Law and order. Say law and order, Joe. He couldn’t do it.\nPresident Trump: (41:21)\nSo we’re joined tonight by some real warriors, warriors of a different type, political warriors. They’re okay too, right? And they’re friends of mine. They’re great people. Representative John Joyce. John, please. A guy has been around a long time and he fights like hell, G.T. Thompson. G.T., thank you. Great. Be careful with your election. I hear you’re only up 40 points, G.T. Another one is only up about 44 points, a really good friend of mine and he’s tough as hell, Mike Kelly. I say G.T., Mike, you need any help, I’ll come and help you. The say, “No, sir, we don’t really need help. Don’t worry about it.” A friend of mine and a great gentleman, and he was the first one that predicted that I was going to win this thing. I’ll tell you, former Congressman Lou Barletta. Thank you, Lou. Thank you, Lou. How are we doing, Lou? Are we doing okay? How do we compare to four years ago? Better. Okay, good. He said the right thing. Anyway, yeah, I think a lot better, because we produced. Again, four years ago. I said we’re going to do things. Now we’ve done them all plus additional things, I mean a lot of additional things. I never talked about Space Force. We did Space Force. You know, somebody did Space Force. That’s like a major achievement for four years. That’s one thing. That’s like one thing out of so many other things. So it’s one of those things, but I never used to talk about that.\nPresident Trump: (42:55)\nAnd former chair of the Pennsylvania Republican party, a friend of mine, the guy that knows more about Pennsylvania than any human being on earth, Rob Gleason. Rob, thank you. How are we doing Rob? Good? Okay, good. He said to me another group came down. They didn’t want his advice. They came down from Boston and they put events all over the place and he said, “You’re going to the wrong location.” Anyway, they ended up losing big. Right? But with us, we came to Rob. We say, where do you think the best places are? And we hit. And we agreed with you too. But Rob Gleason has been a fantastic friend. Thank you, Rob, very much for being here. I appreciate it.\nPresident Trump: (43:33)\nAnd with their help and your help, we are delivering for the American people like never before. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done in three and a half years. No administration’s ever done this the first three and a half years. In my first three years in office, family income increased by $6,000 and that doesn’t include energy, which I think you could double it up. More than five times the gains in all eight years of the Obama administration. African American income grew nine times more than it did under the last administration. Think of it. African American income grew nine, not two, not three, nine times more, and these are out of the book. These numbers are out of the book. Real well for the bottom. 50% grew nearly twice as fast as it grew for the top. 1% Hispanic family net worth increased by 64% in a short period of time, 64.\nPresident Trump: (44:40)\nWe added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs and we added 15,000 factories, and Obama said “You’ll never produce manufacturing jobs.” Remember? You need a magic wand. Well, we found the magic wand. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty including over 1 million African Americans, and more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. And we’re doing great with both groups and we love them. We love both groups. Thank you. Those are great numbers. After our tax cuts took effect, wages for the lowest income Americans grew twice as fast as those near the top. Think of that. You never hear that stuff. The big beneficiary were lowest income Americans. My policies have benefited those who need it the most. After the virus came in from China and we had to change. We had to do things. This came out. It was a sudden horrible thing. China should have never, ever let it happen. They should have never let it happen.\nPresident Trump: (45:44)\nWe’ve seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation by far, and we’ve seen by far the fastest recovery of any nation. In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million jobs, that’s American jobs. That’s the fastest ever recorded. Job growth has been 23 times faster than the first five months. Think of this. For the first five months of the Obama Biden recovery, 23 times. We cut unemployment rate in half. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half the jobs lost to the crisis. We did it in five months. So we’re talking about numbers that nobody can even believe. Homebuilder confidence has reached an all time high. We’re in a pandemic. Reached an all-time high. Manufacturing optimism has doubled. Consumer confidence, which just came out, has surged nearly 20%, and small business confidence is now higher than any time in the entire decade proceeding my election. Think of that. And we’re rounding the turn on our pandemic.\nPresident Trump: (47:05)\nWe’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He made every bad deal in the book. And by the way, if you look at the H1N1, you know, he calls it the N1H1, right? I said, “No, no. H. Here’s the way you remember it, Joe. H comes before I.” And he goes, “The N1H1, whatever it’s called. What was his name again? Or the Senator? Maybe he was a governor.” Yeah, Romney. Romney. “Oh, that’s right. It was Romney.” It’s amazing. You know, amazing. And he gets away with that stuff. You only see it. You only see it on the internet. They never report it. They never report it. They should report it. They’re doing this country a great disservice by not reporting it. But Biden supported NAFTA, TPP, and China’s entry into the WTO, which is one of the worst things that ever happened to this country.\nPresident Trump: (47:59)\nFor half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of the American worker. He should not be asking for your vote. You should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a rotten job. Okay? Did a rotten job. For decades our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong.\nAudience: (48:35)\nUSA! USA! USA! USA!\nPresident Trump: (48:53)\nAlmost done. Syria, we’re gone, except we kept the oil. Does anybody mind that I kept the oil? So we left some troops behind to keep the oil. With Iraq, we’re almost out. With Afghanistan, 19 years in Afghanistan, 19 years, and we’re really serving as policemen. It’s great to be policemen, but they got to have their own policemen. They got to do it themselves. But we’re, we’re bringing them home. We’re down to a very few number of soldiers.\nPresident Trump: (49:22)\nTo save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration’s transpacific partnership disaster. It would have been a disaster. Would have destroyed your automobile industry and others. To defend our steel and aluminum workers, I imposed historic tariffs on dumped goods. Remember when they were dumping steel all over the place? You guys were getting killed. Saving those industries from total destruction. And frankly had the plague not came in from China, but now they’re doing well, anyway, had that not come in, you would have had a steel industry that would have been at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. But it came in, but you’re going to be there anyway in a short period of time, unless some stupid person comes along and raises your taxes by four times what they should be, which is what they want to do.\nPresident Trump: (50:07)\nI ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA into law. Everyone said that was going to be impossible to do. And I withdrew from the job killing Paris Climate Accord. So nice of them to tell us that we can’t use our energy. That was an accord. You know what that was going to? Destroy our country. That’s what that was going to do. If you look at what has happened over the last very short period of time, the progress that this nation has made, you’re not even going to believe it and you’re going to see it. And you would have seen it had the plague not come in because it was all happening. We were at every single record, but now we’re getting close anyway. The jobs are all coming back and the market is almost going to be topping the market from before the plague. And it’s pretty amazing. I will tell you.\nPresident Trump: (50:54)\nBiden has vowed to rejoin this horrible agreement, a death sentence for your state’s energy industry, The Paris Accord. It’s a terrible thing. Unlike Biden, I know my job is to represent Pennsylvania, not Paris. We’re representing Pennsylvania, not Paris. Got a lot of nice people. They can represent Paris.\nPresident Trump: (51:18)\nI took the toughest ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. You know that. We charged them so much. We gave a lot of the money to our farmers, $28 billion to our farmers because our farmers were targeted. Everybody get your money. They did better without even growing anything, to be honest. But we got it from China, $28 billion, and we had a lot left over that went into the treasury of the United States. To defend American workers, earlier today I also signed an order to crack down on Chinese counterfeiters and merchants who sell their fake products all over the United States. They put the name Tiffany, Tiffany. It’s got the blue box, everything. Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany. Isn’t that wonderful? But it wasn’t made by Tiffany.\nPresident Trump: (52:05)\nBiden will eliminate my tariffs on China. He’s already said he’s going to take the tariffs off China. There goes your steel industry. There goes your aluminum industry. That goes everything. Allowing them to plunder without consequence. The one constant in Biden’s platform is surrender. He surrenders. He surrenders whether it’s a China, whether it’s Cuba. How about Cuba? How about the deal they made with Cuba? How bad was that one? I ended it. That’s why both China and the far left are desperate for a Biden win because he will surrender our jobs to China. China will own the United States if that sleepy guy gets the position. Okay? And you can forget about Pennsylvania. And you know, don’t also forget, your streets will be surrendered to the mob. You know, Republican areas are great. They’re doing great. The crime is at record lows, everything else. These are the Democrats, super liberal Democrat areas.\nPresident Trump: (53:06)\nUnlike sleepy Joe Biden, I will never abandon our nation and I will never abandon its values. My goal is not to make friends in the D.C. swamp. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family.\nPresident Trump: (53:25)\nIn 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American. My opponent has put forward a radical plan to eliminate U.S. borders by implementing catch and release programs. And I ended. You know what catch and release is? You catch a murderer, you catch a rapist coming across our border, and you release him. Catch, catch him and release him. And you say, “I’m sorry. Three years from now, please come back for a court case.” Nobody comes back. Impose-\nPresident Trump: (54:03)\nPlease come back for a court case. Nobody comes back. Imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals. They don’t want any removals. This is what Biden agreed to with crazy Bernie Sanders. When you have people that are in this country illegally, even if they’re murderers, if they’re rapists, no matter what they are, you can’t remove them. We’ve removed tens of thousands of people including MS-13.\nPresident Trump: (54:28)\nIt would mean the total nullification of US borders overwhelming every city and town in America, and especially in a place like Pennsylvania. Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone and your safety is gone. Other than that, you’ll be doing very nicely. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we’re finishing that wall. It’s going to be built very soon. It’s going to be finished. We’re going to have the greatest celebration. That was a tough one. That was a tough one. Remember they said, “We don’t need a wall.” They wanted drones, drones flying around looking at the people pouring across the border. They wanted drones. They wanted modern technology. You know what I’ve said often, right? There were two things that will always be around in a thousand years, in 2000 years, all new computers, all new everything. You come up with a new computer. You come up with a new chip. Three days later, it’s obsolete. I would not want to be in that business, but there are two things, a wall and a wheel right? A wall and a wheel. In a thousand years, 2000 years, it’s going to be here. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in more than 75 years, Space Force.\nPresident Trump: (55:54)\nFor our great vets. We pass VA choice and VA accountability. Nobody thought would ever get that done. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi, and we took down 100% of the ISIS caliphate. And when I took over, that caliphate was all over the place. It was a mess. We took down the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of many American troops, many troops, many people all over the world. Qasem Soleimani is dead. Thank you. He’s dead.\nPresident Trump: (56:37)\nI withdrew from the last administration’s disaster, Iran nuclear deal. One of the worst deals I’ve ever seen. That’s John Kerry, the guy was totally incompetent. That guy didn’t know what the hell he was doing. He gave him $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash for nothing. I kept my promise, recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, I’ve been trying to get that. And instead of endless war, we’re forging peace in the Middle East, you see the deals we made? I actually got nominated for a Nobel Peace prize. The press didn’t cover it, but that’s okay.\nPresident Trump: (57:22)\nThe press didn’t cover it. I got nominated for three Nobel Peace prizes. I did more in 47 months in Joe Biden did in 47 years and that’s true. Now Biden is pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. He’s going to ruin your energy. He’s going to ruin your state. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions because there’s no money. Biden’s running mates sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have 180 million people with great private plans. They want to keep it that way. They’re going to outlaw. They’re going to get rid of them.\nPresident Trump: (58:15)\nBiden vowed to terminate our travel bans on Jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions by more than 700%. he agreed to this. He said, “That’s okay. Let them come in. I got the ban right? Remember the ban. Remember who’s a big deal. I got the ban. I said, “If it’s okay, we have unfriendly countries. If it’s all right with you, they’re not coming into our country. I got the ban. We won in the Supreme court, five to four. I got the ban.” He wants to give up the ban. He wants to let people pour into our country. 700% increase opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. I don’t want to speak too much. Made of wood. This is real wood. I don’t want to speak too much, but you haven’t seen too many things happening lately have you? He’ll ban school choice, charter schools and Pennsylvania opportunity scholarships. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. It’s so important.\nPresident Trump: (59:15)\nA vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans and in conclusion and I love being back with you in Pennsylvania. So many incredible memories really. So many. What a night that was. Remember that night? Donald Trump has won the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Donald Trump. Remember how late? They just didn’t want to call it. They didn’t want to call it. I said, “Call it already.” We were at 98%. We were substantially ahead. If I lost every single vote, we still won. It took him like till two o’clock in morning before they called it. In the meantime, Wisconsin came in and Michigan came in, but they just refused to call Pennsylvania. They just couldn’t. Remember them crying and they were all stirred up.\nPresident Trump: (01:00:08)\nOver the next four years. We’ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we’ll end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already happening. We’ll hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities that people don’t want. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. We’ll strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign ridiculous wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military mind and we will ensure peace through strength.\nPresident Trump: (01:01:03)\nAnd by the way, we’ve rebuilt our military. I told you $2.5 trillion. We have weapons and equipment, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia. We are the envy of China. We are the envy of everybody. There is no country that has what we have. And I will tell you when I first came here, one of our generals highly overrated said to me, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” That’s where we started. And now we have the greatest weapons anywhere in the world. And just hope to God, we never have to use them.\nPresident Trump: (01:01:39)\nWe will then surprise medical building, require price transparency which is already signed January 1, it kicks in, and further reduce the costs of prescription drugs. And I’m talking about 50, 60, 70, 80% because of what I’ve done with favored nations, getting the lowest price Mike, the whole world. We’re going down. We’re taking these nations. They pay a fraction of what we pay. I said, “Nope, whatever they pay, I want to pay.” Why are we paying more than any other nation? We’re the highest. We’re going down to match the lowest. The drug companies don’t love me too much just in case you haven’t heard. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. We’ll always protect patients with pre existing conditions.\nPresident Trump: (01:02:24)\nAmerica will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and we’re very close. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania. It’s very important. So get your friends. Most important election we’ve ever had. Get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote like you’d never voted before.\nPresident Trump: (01:03:39)\nPlaces that we won like Erie. Places that we won, you got to get out and vote because from Erie to Easton, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg and from Allentown to right here in Johnstown, we stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence. Think of what you have in Pennsylvania. Who can say that? This is it. What you’ve done here, what the history of this incredible place, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, think of what you’ve done.\nPresident Trump: (01:04:23)\nIt’s where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge and General George Washington… Don’t worry. His statues are not coming down. Led his man on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our nation was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, and forge the steel, that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And you have seen nothing yet. Wait till you see what we’re doing. We are making our country greater than ever before.\nPresident Trump: (01:05:12)\nProud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when you’re great Congressman to come to see me, right? It’s great. What a group of warriors. I don’t know with them. I’m not sure I can handle that group, but when they come in to see me in the Oval Office, they say, “Mr. President, Pennsylvania is not used to winning this much. We got to slow it down a little bit.”\nPresident Trump: (01:05:57)\nAnd I’ll say, “Mike, I’m sorry. Mike, you tell the rest of them Mike. We’re not going to slow it down at all.” Pennsylvania wants to win more than anybody in this country wants to win. Pennsylvania is going to win. We’re never going to stop. We’re going to keep on winning. We’re going to win so much you’re going to love every moment of that era. And you know what? You lost long enough. I can tell you that. Many years where your factories in your plants left because we have stupid leadership. Don’t kid yourself. You lost for a long time. And now you’re winning and you’re winning like never before. Open it up Governor. Open it up.\nPresident Trump: (01:06:35)\nBecause we’re one movement, one family, one people, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much Pennsylvania. Thank you. Get out and vote. Vote, vote, vote.",

About one and three older Floridians rely on Social Security as a sole source of their income and over four and a half million count on Medicare, yet Donald Trump’s executive orders threaten the survival and stability of these critical programs. Make no mistake. Neither of these men will walk into the White House without the blessing of Florida’s seniors. Am I right?\nAudience: (00:32)\nRight. Right.\nSpeaker 1: (00:33)\nYes. There’s no question about that. Much has made in the rise of the youth vote, and thank God for it, but it is residents who are 65 and older who still swing elections here in the Sunshine State. There’s no doubt about that. The road to the White House travels through Florida, and about three-quarters of our seniors turn up at the polls every single election.\nSpeaker 1: (00:56)\nWhile Trump closes down the government’s pandemic strike force, lies to Americans about the threat that it poses, or pushes another quack cure, Joe Biden actually has a plan to get COVID-19 under control. For the long-term security of our seniors, Joe Biden has a plan that actually strengthens Social Security compared to just a few weeks ago when shockingly Donald Trump made it clear he would shred the funding mechanism for this vital safety net for our seniors. You just can’t make this stuff up. This man wants to try to win Florida, and he would shred that vital safety net. Joe Biden rightly says, “This is a battle for the soul of our nation.” There is no question about that. In that battle, Joe Biden will not allow vital programs like Social Security fall victim to this virus. It is the lifesaving program for millions of American senior citizens.\nSpeaker 1: (01:47)\nLet me be very clear, Joe Biden won’t sacrifice Social Security or threatened the future of Medicare to slay this virus like Trump has already proposed. Joe Biden will protect social security with all the political muscle he can muster. The inadequate response to the coronavirus pandemic has caused a crisis in our nursing homes and long-term care facilities.\nSpeaker 1: (02:08)\nAs Trump continues to sit on his hands, Joe Biden released a plan to increase safety, oversight, and transparency so our loved ones can be cared for with the dignity that they deserve. When it comes to protecting Medicare or lowering prescription drug costs, you know Joe Biden will go to bat for Florida seniors because he’s done it all his life. Protecting seniors isn’t just some reality show gimmick that Joe Biden trots out for cameras one day and then moves on from the next day.\nSpeaker 1: (02:37)\nProtecting seniors is who Joe Biden is. It’s who he’s always been. From The Villages in Central Florida to Century Village, Sunrise Lakes, and Kings Point here in Broward County, in their heart of hearts, our seniors know that they can truly count on Joe Biden. They can count on Joe Biden to protect Social Security, to serve Medicare, and make their medications less expensive and more affordable, and deep down, seniors know they can count on Joe Biden to take down this virus and safely reunite them with their friends, children, and grandchildren.\nSpeaker 1: (03:08)\nFlorida’s seniors know they have a friend and ally in Joe Biden because he’s always stood by them, and even in a crisis like this one, he’ll never leave their side. That trust will show itself on election day. It already is. I just know it. 21 days, my friends. Onto victory for Florida, for Florida’s seniors, and for all of America. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 1: (03:30)\n( singing)\nSpeaker 2: (04:09)\nPlease welcome former Weston City Commissioner Toby Feuer.\nSpeaker 2: (04:18)\n(singing)\nToby Feuer: (04:26)\nHello, Broward County. My name is Toby Feuer. I was born in the Bronx. I grew up in New York City. I got married and had two wonderful children. I worked for 25 years at Brooklyn College in administration and moved here to Broward County in 1998 to allegedly retire. Well, it wasn’t much of a retirement for me. I immediately became involved with my condo association and local community, and I served eight years on the Weston City Commission. I like to call myself a professional volunteer. I work with ORT America, the Weston Music Society, Weston Friends of the Library, Hadassah, and the American Association of University Women to name just a few. In short, I like to stay busy.\nToby Feuer: (05:24)\nWe always hear people say, “This is the most important election of our lifetime,” but for Florida seniors, this really is the most important election we will ever vote in. Like so many seniors, I paid into Social Security for my entire life, and I planned my retirement around that income, but now Donald Trump is threatening to defund Social Security. Some of my neighbors depend on Social Security as their sole source of income, and for a president to break his promise to us unconscionable, especially now in the middle of a pandemic.\nToby Feuer: (06:07)\nBefore COVID-19, my weeks with jammed with so many things: meetings, social gatherings, trips, and so much more, but then everything changed. COVID-19 has turned my life upside down. Meetings are over Zoom now. I try to keep in touch with friends over the phone, but it’s simply not the same. I am incredibly fortunate to be living with my daughter who works from home, but I don’t ever leave my house unless it’s to purchase groceries and essentials every two weeks.\nToby Feuer: (06:44)\nThe simple truth is it didn’t have to be this bad. None of us want to live our lives at home in front of a computer screen, and if Donald Trump hadn’t lied to us, and if he had decided to take this virus seriously, things might be different for Florida seniors. But this administration has written seniors off as expendable.\nToby Feuer: (07:10)\nWell, guess what? We aren’t, and we vote. The president has been a disaster for seniors. We deserve better. We deserve a leader who cares about us. I know Joe Biden will look after us. I know Joe will protect and strengthen Social Security, and I know he will lower the cost of prescription drugs. I know that he has a real plan to beat COVID-19 so that our friends and neighbors, we could see them again, our kids, our grandkids, and get life back to normal as soon as possible. Joe Biden will always fight for seniors. That’s why I encourage you and ask you to please get out to vote either by mail or in person for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to be our next President and Vice President of the United States. Thank you so much.\nToby Feuer: (08:46)\n( singing)\nSpeaker 2: (08:57)\nPlease welcome the next President of the United States, Joe Biden.\nSpeaker 2: (09:09)\n(singing)\nAudience: (09:09)\nYeah.\nJoe Biden: (09:09)\nHello, hello, hello.\nAudience: (09:11)\n[inaudible 00:09:11].\nJoe Biden: (09:13)\nGood to see you all. Please, please, take a seat if you have one. Thank you so very, very much for… It’s good to be back in Florida. I want to thank my good friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz, congresswoman. She’s been a tireless fighter. Where’s Debbie? There she is. Thank you, Debbie. You’ve been a friend a long time, and thank you for all the encouragement.\nJoe Biden: (09:38)\nToby, I also want to thank you. Toby moved from a high rent district in Brooklyn. That’s the highest rent district in America right now these days. [inaudible 00:09:48], good to see you. I want to thank you for that kind introduction. It’s wonderful to be here with all of you to hear the stories, talk about how we’re going to get through these tough times, the difficult times. Today’s-\nJoe Biden: (10:02)\n… tough times and difficult times. Today’s story is a familiar one here in South Florida. We’re all living in some version of it right now with some of the most important parts of our lives being put on hold and the same story being lived by people like Carl Schechner, who many of you know well. Carl’s here today, I’m told. Hey Carl. How are you, man? Good to see you. The light was shining right in my eyes looking at you, man. I apologize. Carl is 39 years old. No, 93 years old, but he acts like he’s 39 years old. And the pillar of this community. So much so that a few years back, you all decided to rename this community center in his honor. I’ve heard wonderful things about you, Carl, and looking forward to saying hello to you privately.\nJoe Biden: (10:58)\nI had the pleasure of meeting Carl back in 2012. He may not remember it, but his story is what this community and this country is all about. Carl is a son of an immigrant. Carl served our nation honorably in the second World War and met his sweetheart, Anita, when they were … They’ve been married now for 67 years. Together, they built a family, four children, seven grandchildren. And more than 30 years, they made home here, staying engaged in all the local issues and holding local office, catching Sunday matinees and performances at the arts center and socializing with neighbors, enjoying nights in the town. And a couple of times, two, three times a week, going out.\nJoe Biden: (11:42)\nBut their story, like so many others, is a quintessential American story these days, but it has been interrupted this year. Carl and Anita haven’t been out, I’m told, to a restaurant in seven months and there are no more Sunday matinees. Other than getting groceries, they spend most of their time in their apartment like so many people do. It’s harder than ever to spend time with the people you love, other than on Zoom or on a computer connection. We’ve all felt that sense of interruption in our lives. And we all know that this isn’t normal, that things didn’t have to be this bad. They didn’t have to be this bad. We look around at our neighbors and we know people are hurting. A lot of folks are worried about making their next rent payment, their next mortgage payment, whether or not they can purchase their prescription drugs or put food on the table. And we see an awful lot of people at the very top doing better than they’ve ever done and left to wonder an awful lot of us is, “Who’s looking out for me? Who’s looking out for me?”\nJoe Biden: (12:47)\nThat’s been the entire story of my view of Donald Trump’s presidency. The fact that he’s never been focused on what matters. He’s never been focused on you. His handling of this pandemic has been erratic, just like his presidency has been. And it has prevented Florida’s seniors and people all across the country from getting the relief that they need. Donald Trump hasn’t just been willing to not do the work. I think it’s beyond that. I’m not sure he cares about delivering any real help. I think it’s both. People say he’s not willing to do the work. Well, I don’t think he cares much about it. While you’re losing precious time with your loved ones, he’s been stuck in a sand trap in one of his golf courses. And when he does decide to lift a finger, it doesn’t help you. It’s to propose new tax cuts for billionaires, and that’s not hyperbole. That’s not hyperbole. 100 wealthiest billionaires in America are expected to get another $30 billion tax cut he’s proposing.\nJoe Biden: (13:48)\nWe know what happened the last time a tax cut was passed in 2017 when he came into office. Pharmaceutical companies got billions of dollars in tax breaks, and then they turned around and raised prices for medicines that you rely on to stay healthy. And they’re still doing it even during the pandemic. And quite frankly, it’s unconscionable. But Trump doesn’t really care about lowering the healthcare costs because he’s beholden to the health insurance companies and the drug companies. After all, he’s asking the United States Supreme Court as I speak, he’s asking them right now to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, which would eliminate seniors’ ability … Most of you are on Medicare, but it would eliminate your ability in that act we passed, I was able to help put in place, was that you’d have preventative services and annual checkups and mammograms for free under Medicare. If it gets struck down, that gets wiped out as well. The rise in prescription drug prices for millions of seniors put Medicare trust fund at risk.\nJoe Biden: (14:54)\nAnd by the way, we used to talk about the Medicare trust fund. I say the Republicans want to eliminate it. But remember, Debbie will remember when, he’s not a bad guy in terms of his personality, but when the former Speaker of the House became Speaker, what’d they do? They proposed a half a billion dollar cut in Medicare from the start, right off the bat. These guys mean what they say. This President, as Debbie pointed out, has pledged to terminate the tax that’s dedicated to financing social security. Terminate it. A social security actuary, not Joe Biden or a liberal think tank or a newspaper. The actuary, the social security says, that would bankrupt social security in just a few years, putting those monthly checks for tens of millions of seniors that they rely on, and many of them, the only thing they rely on, at risk.\nJoe Biden: (15:47)\nAll this president knows how to do is play games with people’s lives and families’ futures. Last week, he announced he was “walking away from the negotiations” that he never fully engaged in. He’s not walking away. He never fully engaged in them. To provide any additional relief for American families. Debbie, working like the devil in the house, they passed the HEROES Act. They passed two other pieces of legislation earlier to provide for the ability to keep people from going out of business, people being kicked out of their homes, et cetera. He turned his back on small businesses that are struggling to keep their doors open. He turned his back on firefighters and police officers and first responders who depend on local budgets, but local budgets are being broken and they have to be balanced.\nJoe Biden: (16:36)\nI’ll just make note here. When we inherited the largest recession, the greatest recession since the depression, what happened? President put me in charge of the Recovery Act, $800 billion. First thing I was able to do, and I was able to manage it myself, was I put $147 billion to just help state and local authorities be able to balance their budgets, not have to fire police officers, not have to fire firefighters, not to fire first responders, not have to close down health clinics. Local governments are strained to the breaking point. He turned his back on educators and school children, standing in the way of support to get them PPE and cleaning supplies and ventilation needed to reopen schools safely, which we could do if we funded it. He turned his back on every single worker whose job hasn’t come back.\nJoe Biden: (17:25)\nAnd now he says he wants a deal. One day he’s tweeting that the relief package is too big. The next day saying it’s too small. It’s all game. He thinks he’s still on his game show. No really. He acts that way. For real. This is a political game he’s playing. His latest gimmick, he wants to mail seniors a $200 prescription drug cash card with his name on it. So you’re going to get it before election with his name on it. But what are you going to do? He’s going to raid Medicare trust fund to pay for that $200, which seniors have already spent by paying money into. He thinks that he can take the money out of your pocket with one hand and put it back with his name stamped on it in the other hand and call it a gift. It’s dishonest. It’s reckless. And it doesn’t actually help anybody. In fact, all it will do is undermine the Medicare trust fund and increase overall out-of-pocket costs for seniors.\nJoe Biden: (18:29)\nLet’s be clear about this. Donald Trump has tried for almost four years, he says he wants to lower the drug price. Okay? But he hadn’t done a single thing to do it. In fact, the House of Representatives passed a bill that Debbie supported that would bring down prescription drug costs across the board, giving Medicare the power in Washington, Medicare department, the power to negotiate with the drug companies and say, “If an aspirin is going to cost, if we’re being charged …” I’m making this up. “If an aspirin is going to cost two cents an aspirin,” they said, “We’re only going to pay you a penny an aspirin.” They’re either going to do it or not. They’re going to have to do it. We’ve been fighting to get, Debbie and I and others, have been fighting to be able to do this for years. It would lower drug prices. What did President Trump do? He said, “If it passes, he’ll veto it.” Threatened to veto it. Folks, Donald Trump’s chaotic and divisive leadership has cost us far too much. 215,000 deaths from COVID-19 and rising. Experts say we’ll lose nearly another 200,000 lives in the next few months unless we fundamentally change courses. You know, I prayed for his recovery when he got COVID and I’d hoped at least he’d come out of it somewhat chastened. But what has he done? He’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before and making it worse.\nJoe Biden: (20:03)\nHe’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before and making it worse. So many lives have been lost unnecessary because this President cares more about the stock market than he does about the well-being of seniors.\nJoe Biden: (20:13)\nOne day before we crossed the threshold of 200,000 deaths, you may recall this, the President was at the campaign rally and insistent that the virus was, and I quote, “Affects virtually nobody, just elderly people with heart and other problems.” Nobody. Think about that. Who was he talking about when he said it infects virtually nobody? He was talking about America’s seniors. He was talking about you. He was talking about my family. You’ve worked hard your whole life contributing to society, building a family, building the country, serving America. You deserve security. You deserve respect and peace of mind, but you’re not getting it.\nJoe Biden: (21:05)\nAnd by the way, if this wasn’t so bizarre, if I tried to make a movie talking about something like this in America, you’d think I was making it up. Because Donald Trump, it’s simple, not a joke, you’re expendable. You’re forgettable. You’re virtually nobody. That’s how he sees seniors. That’s how he sees you.\nJoe Biden: (21:29)\nIt’s no surprise this is the same man that looks at Americans who put their lives on the line like you did, sir, and many others maybe in this room, for our nation and calls them losers and suckers. I carried this card with me every day for the last 15 years. It’s my schedule. In the back of this schedule, I have a black box. It says, “Daily troop update.” The number of troops who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6,924. Not roughly 6,900, 924 because every one of these fallen angels that left a family behind deserves to be remembered. Everyone. US troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, 53,000, as of today, 194. Everyone with only one sacred obligation, America, to care for those we send a war and equip them when they come home and take care of them and their families. And what did he say? Losers.\nJoe Biden: (22:40)\nMy son volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. Before that, he had been in Kosovo for eight months. Best of my knowledge, the only foreigner who has a war monument and a major highway in that country named after him for his contribution to helping them set up their criminal justice system, then he volunteered to go to Iraq as attorney general for a year. My son was not a loser. And all of those left behind, he’s passed away, but all those left behind, they were heroes. They were patriots. I imagine that’s one of the reasons why six four-star generals and a whole lot of others have endorsed me who used to work for him because they know where his heart isn’t.\nJoe Biden: (23:28)\nThat’s how he sees us. That’s the attitude he’s brought toward this whole crisis. This is the same man, you may remember, when he was told we were averaging 1000 lives lost per day, remember what he said? He said, “It is what it is.” Such concern and empathy. It is what it is. Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. That’s why it is what it is. This President, as Debbie referenced, back in January when he was being briefed by the intelligence community, he said, “I never read the briefing.” Didn’t know what was in. Didn’t have time. Well, [inaudible 00:24:15] ego moved him to try to convince a famous journalist to write something good about him. What happened? Bob Woodward interviewed him. He acknowledged that he knew it was a dangerous and highly communicable disease, but he did nothing. He didn’t do a thing. He didn’t tell you. He didn’t tell any American. Why? He told Woodward on tape, he told Bob he didn’t want to panic the American public.\nJoe Biden: (24:55)\nAmericans don’t panic. Trump panics. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis is unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is the President, the more reckless he seems to get. Thank God we only have three weeks left to go.\nJoe Biden: (25:14)\nDr. Fauci, the most respected doc in the country on these issues, referred to the President’s announcement on the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden, using the White House as a backdrop for political events. He said it was a super spreader event. And how is Trump responding? He’s running a national ad quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Fauci had said way back in March, referring to public health officials across the nation, he said, quote, “I can’t imagine anybody could be doing more,” end of quote, meaning public health officials.\nJoe Biden: (25:57)\nBut the Trump campaign, which is not unusual because I’ve had a piece of it, the trump campaign has deliberately lied. They have put Dr. Fauci in their ad asserting that Fauci was talking about Trump when he said they couldn’t have done anymore. And Fauci’s a man of integrity. After that ad came out, he said, “I did not give permission to use that quote and I wasn’t referring to the President.” Even after Fauci said that he didn’t say that about the President, the Trump ad campaign said they were going to continue to use the ad knowing it was a lie. Can any of you ever remember anything like that in a presidential campaign with a mainstream candidate?\nJoe Biden: (26:55)\nAnd as a consequence to months of lying and misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are around the dining room table tonight because of his negligence? How many people’s hearts are broken? How many people have trouble going to sleep at night because you can’t just reach over and touch? They can’t hear their son or daughter’s voice on the phone, while he throws super spreader parties at the White House where Republicans hug each other without concern to the consequences.\nJoe Biden: (27:42)\nHow many of you have been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months? I got six of them. Two of them I just see [inaudible 00:27:53] children, a boy and a girl live not far from me and they can walk through the woods. The only way I can see them, I stand in the back porch and they stand down and I bribe them with Haagen-Dazs bars. But every single day I contact them. But I can’t hug them. I can’t embrace it. And I’m luckier than most because they’re nearby, those two of those six.\nJoe Biden: (28:21)\nMy grandkids, your grandkids, we hope will grow up to treat one another with kindness, respect and empathy, qualities the President has never, ever shown. It’s become painfully clear as his careless arrogant, reckless COVID response has caused one of the worst tragedies in American history. The only senior that Donald Trump cares about, the only senior is the senior Donald Trump [inaudible 00:28:52] seem to do anything for.\nJoe Biden: (28:53)\nAnd by the way, minority communities are getting particularly hit by this. You realize as of about a month ago, on a percentage basis, 1 in 1000 African Americans in all of American have died. And the estimate is, by the end of this year, 1 in 500 African Americans in America will die. 1 in 500. If he doesn’t do something quickly and we hit 400,000, that is more people, the same number of people that died in the war you fought of all four years. 400,000 dead in War War II, in less than a year if he doesn’t move. The only one Donald Trump would do anything for is Donald Trump.\nJoe Biden: (29:57)\nLook, folks, you all know we’re so much better than this. We-\nJoe Biden: (30:02)\nWe’re so much better than this. We can contain this virus. We can fully reopen our economy. We can bring Congress together to pass real relief, and then implement a comprehensive agenda to build back better. My economic proposal … And by the way, it’s not a liberal think tank or a Democratic think tank that says this. An independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm, projects that my economic plan will create 18.6 million good paying jobs between now and the end of the first term. Seven million more jobs than the President’s plan. And create a trillion more dollars in economic growth than the President’s plan. It’s solid. It’s real.\nJoe Biden: (30:49)\nHere’s how my plan works. I’m not going to raise taxes on a single solitary American making less than $400,000 a year. You won’t pay a penny more. It’s a guarantee. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay their fair share to straighten out the tax structure. That money will allow us to invest in working people. I carry it with me … I don’t know if I have it with me now, I don’t … a card that lists all of what is in the tax code. We went ahead, the President’s tax plan, Barack and I were suggesting we reduce corporate tax from 35% to 28. That was the consensus. He reduced it to 21%. You know how much that costs? $1.3 trillion. We just take it back up to 28, and we’ll generate $1.3 trillion more.\nJoe Biden: (31:47)\n91 of the Fortune 500 companies don’t pay a penny in tax. Not a single solitary cent. If we made sure there was a minimum tax at 15%, that would add another $400 billion. We’re going to take this money and we’re going to invest in a working people, in a growing middle class and make sure everyone is included in the deal. I want tax reform in the tax code because we’re spending your tax dollars on the wrong things. As I said, Donald Trump cut the tax from 35 to 21 costing the treasury a fortune. As I said, if we raised it back to 28%, $1.3 trillion would be coming to the treasury over the next decade, instead of giving big corporations hundreds of billions to pay for buying back their own stock, moving jobs overseas.\nJoe Biden: (32:41)\nWe should invest it in cures for cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. That’s why I proposed giving the National Institute of Health $50 billion over the next four years to go after cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. If we do not, and no drug company has the capacity to do it, if we do not find an answer to Alzheimer’s, then the next 19 years, every single solitary bed that exists in the United States of America now will be occupied by an Alzheimer’s patient.\nJoe Biden: (33:21)\nLook, my dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joey, if everything’s equally important to you, nothing’s important to you. You have to have priorities.” What are our priorities? Our priorities is to make sure that everybody in America has an equal shot. This is about you. It’s about what’s fair. It’s about what our priorities should be, and we can deal with the scourge of cancer and these other diseases when Donald Trump has no interest. In fact, he wants to do the opposite. He proposes more tax cuts for the super wealthy. Like Donald Trump, we’re going to ease the burden on major costs in your life, unlike him. Including the financial burden of caregiving so many families are now carrying.\nJoe Biden: (34:05)\nRight now, as you probably know, and you have friends, 800,000 Americans are eligible for home community care through Medicaid, signed up for it, have been waiting an average of five years. They’re waiting for a phone call back. For some, five years. My plan makes a bold investment so the states can clear the waiting list and also take the pharmaceutical companies. Will allow Medicaid to, again, use its enormous bargaining power to negotiate prices and bring the costs down for everyone, not just seniors. Give all Americans access to those lower prices.\nJoe Biden: (34:47)\nAnd what he also hates my doing and so do the drug companies, we’re going to establish a board like it is in other countries of outside experts to set limits on the prices of new specialty drugs that are life-saving drugs that costs an arm and leg, figuratively and literally, that have no competition. This board is going to set up and say, “This is how much you can charge based on what you’ve invested. You make a healthy profit, but you will not be able to raise the price of the drug without proof that you’ve taken other action that you have required you to improve the drug.” So it can only be raised with the cost of medical inflation.\nJoe Biden: (35:25)\nIndependent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. How many of you know somebody who’s had to sell things just to get the drugs that have gone up exponentially? We’re going to protect Social Security and increase benefits for millions of seniors. I’ll fight to protect your pensions, including fixing older employer pensions, so many Floridians earned and deserve. Folks, I guess we’ll see them with this. I’m confident. I know as bad as things are we say, “Oh my God, how can it get better?” I am absolutely confident we can do this and more. We just have to come together. I’m running as a proud Democrat. I’m going to govern as an American president. I’m going to work as hard for those who voted against me as those who voted for me.\nJoe Biden: (36:20)\nThat’s the job of a president. A duty to care. To care for everyone. And after all we’ve been through, all America’s accomplished, all the years that we’ve stood as a beacon to the world, we cannot let ourselves remain divided, but we have to vote. Go to, Iwillvote.com/fl. You can still request your vote by mail ballot. The deadline’s October 24. Request your ballot. If you have it already mail it or drop it in one of the drop boxes today. Look, I’m tired of us all walking around with our heads down, as if there’s nothing we can do. This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, nothing we’ve ever decided to do we’ve not accomplished, when we done it together. Remember when we were kids, you had to learn about famous speech John Kennedy made about going to the moon. Everybody remembers the different pieces of it.\nJoe Biden: (37:29)\nThe part I remember, my college used to kid me in the Senate when I was there. When answering the unasked question, “Why was he doing it?” He said, “Because we refuse to postpone.” We refuse to postpone one more day, which is within our capacity as Americans to do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to our future. We’ve got to stand up, lift our heads up. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. And he’s well on the way trying to do that. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. That’s within who we are. Who we are. We choose hope over fear. Unity, over division. Science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. We can do this folks. I promise you. But you got to vote. May god bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for listening. You’re a very patient audience. Thank you, thank you. Appreciate it.",

         "Mike Pence: (05:38)\nHello, Wisconsin. To Congressman Steil, Congressman Grothman, to Dave Ball, and all the great men and women of Weldall Manufacturing. It is great to be back in the Badger State.\nCrowd: (05:50)\nWe’re glad you’re here.\nCrowd: (05:51)\nWe love you.\nMike Pence: (05:52)\nI know this is Packer’s Country.\nCrowd: (05:53)\nYes it is.\nMike Pence: (05:55)\nWith that 4-0 record, but judging from the flags and the yard signs I saw on the way here, this is also Trump Country.\nCrowd: (06:15)\nYes, it is.\nMike Pence: (06:17)\nBut I appreciate you all coming out today. I really do.\nCrowd: (06:17)\nWe love you.\nMike Pence: (06:17)\nIt’s great to be here with so many friends-\nCrowd: (06:20)\nYou’re the best.\nMike Pence: (06:20)\nEspecially great to back to be in the home district of a rising star in the Republican Party, a man who had big shoes to fill and he’s gone and filled them. He’s emerged as one of the great conservative champions in the House of Representatives. With a hometown crowd, give a round of applause to Congressman Brian Steil style for me. What a great guy. Where are you Brian? Thank you Brian.\nMike Pence: (06:47)\nWhile you’re at it, thank Congressman Glenn Grothman for coming out today. He is a tenacious, principled conservative. But I got to tell you we’re here for one reason, and one reason only, and that is that Wisconsin and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\nCrowd: (07:09)\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\nMike Pence: (07:21)\nIt’s on, everybody. Three weeks from today and the road to victory goes right through Wisconsin. I was in Utah last week. We had a little debate with Kamala Harris. I don’t know if you had a chance to see it.\nMike Pence: (07:43)\nSome people think we did all right. Well, let me be honest with you. I, I think that wasn’t just a debate between two candidates for Vice President. I think it was a debate between two visions, and two futures and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want a future of higher taxes-\nCrowd: (08:06)\nYes, they do.\nMike Pence: (08:06)\nOpen borders, socialized medicine.\nCrowd: (08:09)\nThree for three.\nMike Pence: (08:10)\nThey want to abolish fossil fuels. They want to use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. They want to defund the police and pack the Supreme Court.\nCrowd: (08:19)\nBoo.\nMike Pence: (08:21)\nPresident Trump’s vision for the future, we’re going to keep supporting our military and we’re going to keep cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, unleashing American energy, securing our border, supporting law enforcement, life, liberty, and the constitution of the United States. I mean, when you compare the Biden/Harris agenda with our agenda-\nCrowd: (08:50)\nThere is no-\nMike Pence: (08:50)\nThe choice is clear. If you cherish faith and freedom and law and order and life, three weeks from today, you need to do everything in your power to work, to voice, to vote, to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. I mean, think about how far we’ve come. Four years ago, we inherited a military that was hollowed out by devastating budget cuts.\nCrowd: (09:20)\nShame on them.\nMike Pence: (09:21)\nAn economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world. Worst of all, we’ve witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values. But in three short years, I’m proud to report to you, we rebuilt our military. We restored the arsenal of democracy and I couldn’t be more proud to be Vice President to a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their family.\nCrowd: (09:56)\nYes, sir. Yes.\nMike Pence: (10:00)\nUnder President Donald Trump, we’re finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard, the resources and the support that they need to defend this nation. It’s personal to me. My son’s a Captain in the United States Marine Corps and my son-in-law, my unworthy son-in-law, is an F-18 pilot, currently deployed overseas in service in the United States Navy. On this 245th birthday of the United States Navy, I’m proud to tell you that we are on track to have a 350-ship Navy. 20 of those ships are being built right here at Fincantieri Ship Yard in Marinette, Wisconsin.\nMike Pence: (10:56)\nA lot to be proud of. We’ve stood with those who serve in the uniform of the United States and every single day, President Donald Trump has stood with all the men and women who’ve worn the uniform of the United States. President Donald Trump is the most pro-veterans president in my lifetime.\nCrowd: (11:28)\nOf course, he is. Yeah. Yeah.\nMike Pence: (11:28)\nIn fact, since you all are standing, if you served in our military, would the men and women who are veterans, would you put your hand in the air and let us say thanks one more time for your service to this nation. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service. Thank you. When Joe Biden was Vice President, America saw years of scandal at the VA that shocked the conscience of our nation. We literally had veterans who were perishing, waiting for services at the VA, that they earned in the uniform of the United States. But under President Donald Trump, those days are over.\nCrowd: (12:17)\nThank goodness.\nMike Pence: (12:22)\nFin our first year in office, President Trump signed the most sweeping reforms of the VA, in 50 years. We have fired thousands of VA employees that weren’t providing the care to our veterans, and now Veterans Choice is available to every veteran in America.\nCrowd: (12:38)\nThank you.\nMike Pence: (12:45)\nWe didn’t just rebuild our military and support our vets. In our first three years, we revived the American economy, created the greatest economy the world has ever known. Where Joe Biden wants to raise taxes, president Trump cut taxes across the board-\nCrowd: (13:02)\nThank you.\nMike Pence: (13:02)\n… for working families and businesses, just like this one. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history. We unleashed American energy. We fought for free and fair trade. In just three short years, businesses, large and small, created more than 7 million good-paying jobs, including 61,000 jobs right here in the Badger State.\nCrowd: (13:26)\nYes, yeah.\nMike Pence: (13:30)\nWisconsin achieved a near record, low unemployment of 3.1%. Here in the Badger State, we also saw average hourly earnings grew nearly as much in our first three years, as they did during all eight years when Joe Biden was Vice President, and maybe most meaningful all to me and the President, during those first three years, wages rose across the board, the fastest pace in 10 years, but they rose most rapidly for hard-working, blue-\nMike Pence: (14:03)\n… years, but they rose most rapidly for hard-working, blue-collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no more. Can I just say, none of that would have been possible without the strong and principled leadership and partnership the President and I enjoyed with former Governor Scott Walker. President Trump and I know Scott Walker’s leadership, past, present, and future, will make a great difference for Wisconsin and America. Standing here at Weldall, a great manufacturing company. I’m just remembering back when Joe Biden was vice president, America lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. You know, I like to say being from the heartland as well, out in this part of the country, we do two things well. We make things and we grow things … Manufacturing and agriculture is the heart of the heartland.\nMike Pence: (15:20)\nBut remember when Joe Biden was vice president four years ago, his president said that those manufacturing jobs they lost were never coming back. Do you remember? He said, what magic wand do you have? Well, we didn’t need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. 500,000 manufacturing jobs in just three years including 16,000 right here in Wisconsin. And all along the way, President Donald Trump has stood for the rule of law. We stand here today, I’m proud to report to you that we’ve seen confirmed more than 230 conservative judges to our federal courts at every level and they’re all men and women who will uphold the God-given liberties in our constitution like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms. Now, last month we paused as a nation to honor the life and service of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. But when the memorials were over, President Donald Trump fulfilled his constitutional duty and he nominated a principled, extraordinary, conservative woman to the Supreme Court of the United States, Judge Amy Coney Barrett and she’s from the Hoosier state, just saying. You know, the confirmation hearings have started. I was watching a little bit on Air Force Two on the way here. America is seeing the character, the quality and the intellect that Judge Amy Coney Barrett shine forth. The President and I said early on though, the Judge [inaudible 00:17:37].\nMike Pence: (17:49)\n… Democrat on the judiciary committee actually said that Judge Barrett’s Catholic faith was of concern. Senator Feinstein said, because “the dogma lives loudly within you”. And Hollywood elites have already begun to criticize Judge Barrett for her family and her faith. Well, I got news for the Democrats and their friends in Hollywood. That dogma lives loudly in me. That dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and work and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States of America.\nMike Pence: (18:44)\nThese attacks on religious faith must stop and they must stop now. Now the Senate has a job to do, and they’re going about the business of advising and consenting right now. But I’ll make your prediction, Judge Amy Coney Barrett will soon be Justice Amy Coney Barrett. We’re going to fill that seat. But you know, talking about the Supreme Court, the people of Wisconsin deserve to know that after 150 years with nine seats on the Supreme Court of the United States, Democrats in Washington are actually talking about packing the court. And Joe Biden is refusing to answer the question. He refused to answer the question in the presidential debate. His running mate, Kamala Harris, refused to answer the question when I posed it to her. And last Friday, Joe Biden was asked if voters deserved to know if he was going to pack the court and he said, and I quote, ” No, they don’t.” Well, Joe, yes, we do. When you’re running for the highest office in the land, the American people deserve to know if you’re going to respect the highest court in the land.\nMike Pence: (20:20)\nI mean, you all get it. Out here in the heartland, we might have been born in the morning, but we weren’t born yesterday morning. I mean, the only explanation about why they aren’t answering the question is because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are planning to pack the court with liberal judges if they win this election, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years and protect an independent judiciary for generations to come.\nCrowd: (20:54)\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\nMike Pence: (21:08)\nSo we’ve stood for the rule of law and an independent judiciary, conservatives on our courts. And as Congressman Stile just said, every single day, President Donald Trump has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will. I like to say all my heroes wear uniforms. It’s true. When I was growing up, my mom and dad used to take us back home where they grew up in Chicago go to my grandparent’s house and there I’d see my uncle. He was a young man then. He’d come walking out in that police uniform, sidearm strapped to his side. Me and my three brothers would just look up in awe.President Trump and I know what you all know. The men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in this country and they deserve the respect of every American every single day.\nMike Pence: (22:25)\nNow, the President and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest. It’s enshrined in the Constitution. But writing and looting is not peaceful protest, burning businesses is not free speech, violence against innocent civilians, the destruction of property or violence against law enforcement will not be tolerated. And those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\nMike Pence: (22:59)\nNow, for months, all Joe Biden talked about was peaceful protesters. Remember? All summer long as the American people watched businesses and communities literally burn. We saw cities in Wisconsin like Kenosha and Milwaukee beset by violence and destruction. The truth of the matter is though, Joe Biden would double down on the policies that have led to violence in America’s cities. I mean, when you withdraw support for those who protect and serve, you only embolden those who would do harm to our families and our communities. I mean, it’s no surprise Milwaukee has literally seen 110% increase in homicides this year all while Milwaukee’s Democrat mayor has called for cutting 120 police officers [inaudible 00:24:02] 2021. Now Joe Biden justifies it all by saying that America, in his words, is systemically racist. And he says that police have a “implicit bias against minorities.”\nMike Pence: (24:21)\nWhen Joe Biden was asked if he’d support cutting funding to law enforcement, he replied. Yes, absolutely. Let me make your promise. Under President Donald Trump, we’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. We’re going to back the blue every day for four more years. Under President Donald Trump, we’re going to have a law and order in every city, in every state for every American of every race and creed and color, so help us God.\nMike Pence: (25:06)\nYou know, the President and I know what you know. We don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our families in the African-American community or in other minority communities. I mean, the truth of the matter is, we have done both the last three and a half years. We supported law enforcement. 4,000 police officers funded through the COPS program. Operation Legend surged into cities around the country. And under this president, I’m proud to say in our first three years we had the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African-Americans. We made funding to historically black colleges and universities permanent with record funding. We passed criminal justice reform and President Trump fought for school choice for every family and every community in this country. So we’re going to keep doing both. We’re going to keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting our African-American neighbors.\nMike Pence: (26:12)\nSo we stood for the rule of law. We stood for law and order for every American of every race and creed and color. And from day one, this president has also stood for the right of every American to live, to work and to worship according to the dictates of our conscience. People of faith had no greater champion than President Donald Trump. It’s true. Under this president’s leadership, we restored the conscience rights of doctors and nurses, teachers, and religious charities and President Donald Trump ended the last administration’s assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor and the Supreme Court voted by seven to two to make it permanent. I mean, it’s amazing to think about it. I’m a product of eight years of Catholic education. You with me?\nMike Pence: (27:16)\nI mean, I had some wonderful nuns that poured that foundation in my life, and I was afraid of almost every single one. Are you with me? Unbelievable women. But think about the Little Sisters of the Poor, women who’ve taken a vow of poverty to do nothing more than to help the underserved community. And when Joe Biden was vice president, they hauled the Little Sisters in the federal court to force them to compromise their faith, to live under the mandates of Obamacare. But you all deserve to know that after the Supreme Court ruled in our favor and in favor of Little Sisters of the Poor, Joe Biden said, if he’s elected, he’s going to work to reimpose the Obamacare mandates on the Little Sisters of the Poor and other religious institutions.\nMike Pence: (28:02)\n… Sisters of the Poor and other religious institutions. In fact, if you doubt it, even his running mate attacked one of our judicial nominees that we were appointing from Nebraska because he was a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. Let me tell you, men and women, with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, we’re going to respect the religious freedom of every American of every faith, so help us God.\nMike Pence: (28:41)\nAnd when you talk about values beyond all that, I couldn’t be more proud to be Vice President to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. Where Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history.\nMike Pence: (29:16)\nSo we’ve rebuilt our military, revived our economy. We’ve stood for law and order, liberties and life. And let me say none of that would have been possible without the strong and consistent support of you conservative leaders from here in Wisconsin. Would you join me in thanking Senator Ron Johnson for his firm, principled leadership in the United States Senate? We need a renewed Republican majority in the Senate, and we need Congressman Brian Steil and Congressman Glenn Grothman back in a new Republican majority that will retire Nancy Pelosi once and for all.\nMike Pence: (30:13)\nI mean, it’s amazing to think about what we accomplished in our first three years. With a Republican House and a Republican Senate, we laid a foundation of security and prosperity, and I think there’s only one way to describe it. In three short years, we made America great again. Am I right?\nMike Pence: (30:41)\nAnd then the coronavirus struck from China. But I’m here to tell you, before the first documented case of community transmission within the United States, President Trump did what no American president had ever done in our history. He suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Joe Biden said that was, “Hysterical.” And xenophobic. He actually wrote an editorial in January where he said it was fear-mongering suspending travel would actually make things worse.\nMike Pence: (31:21)\nBut I can tell you firsthand, as head of the White House coronavirus task force, President Trump’s action suspending all travel from China bought us invaluable time to stand up the largest national mobilization since World War II and it saved countless American lives. In the time that we gained, we reinvented testing. We’ve done more than 120 million tests so far. We saw to the manufacture and delivery of hundreds of billions of supplies, of medical supplies. We’re developing medicines that are literally saving lives, and I’m proud to report we are on track to have the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year. As President Trump said on the south lot a few days ago, through the power of American science and medicine, we will eradicate the China virus. I spoke to the President this morning before I got on the plane and I’m happy to report President and First Lady Melania are doing just great. And he is back on the road today. But let me say on the President’s behalf how moved we’ve all been by the outpouring of concern and especially prayers for our first family. It’s meant so much. But the President and I know the outpouring of love and care and concern for them is just emblematic of the same care and concern and prayers that the American people have ushered for family and neighbors and friends, and even strangers that have dealt with this coronavirus pandemic. So can we just take a moment? Can we give a round of applause to the doctors, the nurses, the first responders, all those in ministry who have come alongside families struggling with loss in the midst of this pandemic? You are heroes all.\nMike Pence: (33:49)\nI promise all of you, we’re going to keep making sure our doctors and nurses have all the resources they need. We’re going to keep protecting the vulnerable and saving lives. And while Joe Biden is talking about shutting down our economy, under President Donald Trump, we’re opening up America again. In just the last five months after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, we’ve already seen 11.5 million Americans go back to work, including 237,000 people right here in Wisconsin. Amazing.\nMike Pence: (34:37)\nWe’re opening up America and we are opening up America’s schools. We announced a week ago that we’re distributing 100 million rapid point of care tests to school nurses and school administrators all across America, just to make sure we can get our kids back in the classroom and keep them safely back in the classroom where they belong. In fact, I’ve been married to a school teacher for 35 years and Karen is already back in the classroom at that little Christian school she teaches. Can we just hear it for all the teachers that did all the remote teaching and all the … What an incredible job. We love all of you. Great job.\nMike Pence: (35:35)\nSo men and women in Wisconsin, we’ve gone through a time of testing. But in three weeks from today, we’re coming to a time for choosing. The choice in this election has never been clearer. The stakes have never been higher. It’s amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. President Trump, we not only cut taxes in our first three years, but we’re going to keep cutting taxes for middle-class Americans for four more years. Joe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape. President had to remind him the other day that he actually supports the Green New Deal. He wants to put us back in that Paris Climate Accord. President Trump, he’s cut red tape at record levels. Our air and land and water are the cleanest at any time in history and America is a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years.\nMike Pence: (36:48)\nAnd when it comes to trade, so important here in the heartland, international trade, what we make, what grow, the contrast couldn’t be more clear. When we came into office, half of our international trade deficit was with communist China. It’s true. We were losing $500 billion a year to China in our trading relationship. Joe Biden’s been a cheerleader for communist China all along the way. In fact, he said that the rise of China was a positive development. Maybe for China. President Trump, he put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over. We imposed tariffs on China to demand that they open their markets to what we make and what we grow. And we’re going to stand firm until China opens the door to American manufacturing and agriculture.\nMike Pence: (37:54)\nAnd closer to home, I don’t have to tell all of you what NAFTA meant across the heartland. It’s just amazing. Back in Indiana, we literally saw entire communities shuttered in the 25 years since NAFTA was signed into law. Jobs moved South to Mexico. I mean, literally on election day four years ago, we heard of a company in Indiana that was announcing they were still moving jobs to Mexico. Joe Biden never lifted a finger for 25 years to improve NAFTA. But thanks to the man who wrote the Art Of The Deal, Wisconsin and America got a real deal. The USMCA is here today and NAFTA is yesterday.\nMike Pence: (38:47)\nLet me tell you, USMCA was a huge victory for Wisconsin workers and Wisconsin dairy. Before the USMCA, Canada was actually imposing quotas on our great dairy industry. They had tariffs running as high as 300% on dairy products, like what’s called specialty milk. But I was there many times when the President was on the phone with his counterpart in Canada. I’m telling you what, he drove a hard bargain for dairy. President Donald Trump fought for Wisconsin, dairy, and under the USMCA we’re going to ask for $300 million more in dairy every single year.\nMike Pence: (39:50)\nAnd I’m telling you, the people of this state also deserve to know that Joe Biden’s his running mate, Kamala Harris, was one of only 10 senators to vote against the USMCA. I brought it up last week in Utah. I mean, she said the USMCA didn’t go far enough on climate change. Kamala Harris put her radical environmental agenda ahead of Wisconsin dairy and Wisconsin workers. And it’s one more reason why Wisconsin needs to say no to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Even closer to home, here in the state where school choice began, people of Wisconsin deserve to know the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, they want to end school choice. They want to shut down charter schools. President Trump and I, we’ve been fighting to give every parent the right to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income and area code and we’re going to fight for parental choice in education for four more years.\nMike Pence: (41:29)\nFinally, where President Trump and I have been working every day, to give the American people better healthcare that protects preexisting conditions and lowers the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are planning a government takeover of healthcare. And Kamala Harris was the original co-sponsor of Bernie Sanders’ socialist Medicare For All bill. And Joe Biden’s embrace of a public option in Obamacare would put us on an inevitable path to socialized-\nMike Pence: (42:03)\n… would put us on an inevitable path to socialized medicine. But, let me make you a promise. With four more years of President Donald Trump and the White House, we’re going to give the American people the world-class health care that you deserve. We’re going to protect pre-existing conditions. We’re going to lower the cost of health insurance. We’re going to harness the power of the free market in America. We’ll never be a socialist country.\nMike Pence: (42:33)\nYou know, when you look at their agenda, it’s clear. I mean, Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. Joe Biden says that democracy is on the ballot. Well, I think our economic recovery is on the ballot. I think law and order are on the ballot, but I also believe the things much more foundational to who we are, are on the ballot. You know, I think three weeks from today, when all the dust settles in this election, it’s not going to be whether America is more Republican or more Democrat, more conservative or more liberal, more red or more blue. I think the choice in this election is whether America remains America.\nCrowd: (43:40)\nUSA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!\nMike Pence: (43:59)\nIt’s whether we’re going to chart a course for our children and our grandchildren, that’s grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, individual responsibility, and all the values enshrined in our constitution, or whether we’re going to let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and their party take us down a path towards socialism and decline. So let me say from my heart, for our freedom and all the ideals that have always made America great, we need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be President of the United States. We’re going to reelect president Donald Trump for four more years.\nMike Pence: (44:57)\nSo I’m grateful you came out today. I want to thank you. Give Weldall Manufacturing another round of applause, would you?. Thank you. Jay, thanks for having me out. Thank you to you and your family and your great team. It is great to be back. It truly is. And I hope you’ll carry what I’ve said here today, every day, for the next three weeks. Let me say, I was over at Weldall the other day. I ran into Mike out in the parking lot and he was telling me what four more years is going to mean for this country. You tell him, I said, “Four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means more support for our troops and our police.” And you tell him, I said, “It’s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp.”\nCrowd: (45:58)\nDrain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!\nMike Pence: (46:11)\nOh, we’re draining it. You know, four years ago a movement was born and you were all a part of it and so was I. A movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. Here in Wisconsin, you believed we could be strong again. You believed we could be prosperous again. Wisconsin said yes to president Donald Trump in 2016 and I know Wisconsin is going to say yes to four more years of president Donald Trump in 2020, but it’s going to take all of us to do it. It’s on. It’s on everybody. Three weeks to go. And I’m telling you what, in all the efforts that you put forward and everything that remains between now and the close of the polls, I want to assure you.\nMike Pence: (47:08)\nI’ve been with this president every day for the last four years. I’ve seen him when the cameras are off, when nobody’s looking, and I can tell you firsthand, my friend, our president, has never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of Wisconsin. Now it’s our turn to fight for him. So I’ve got a couple things to ask of you. Number one, keep bringing all this enthusiasm. I got to tell you what, you people … What a great group, man! First and foremost, you need to vote, Wisconsin. Vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. I’m told early voting starts in just a few days. And remember friends don’t let friends vote alone. Bring a family member, bring a neighbor, bring a coworker.\nMike Pence: (48:25)\nAnd after you vote, I want you to tell somebody. You know, I’ll always believe that the most powerful media in America is not your big newspapers or your big TV networks. It’s not all your cable news. It’s not even social media. What you all proved in 2016 is that the most powerful media in America is with someone who knows you and respects you, hears from you about an issue, a candidate, a cause that you think is important to them and their family and the state and the nation. So right after you vote, I want you to spend every day between now and election day, talking about all that we’ve done for this country. Talking about the choice in this election, because I really believe it made the difference in 2016.\nMike Pence: (49:20)\nThe American people were talking to one another. We were turning down the sound of all the TV pundits and the prognosticators, and we were listening to each other and listening to the heart of this nation. And finally, I would ask you if you’re inclined to do one more thing, that you consider doing that over the next three weeks. You know, all my travels around this country over the last four years, I’m convinced of two things. That America is a freedom-loving nation, and America is a nation of faith. I mean the sweetest words the President and I ever hear, are when people will reach out across a rope line, stop you on the street corner, where in all the letters that I receive, almost every single one, is people tell you, “I’m praying for you.”\nCrowd: (50:21)\nWe are!\nMike Pence: (50:24)\nAnd so I just want to say to each one of you, if you’re inclined to bow the head and bend the knee, it’d be a good time to do it over the next three weeks. And when you pray, I want to encourage you to pray with confidence, that in those ancient words that Americans have clung to in much more challenging times than we could possibly imagine, that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray in turn, that he’ll do like he’s always done through the long and storied history of this nation. He’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land. This one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America, pray for all the American people. It’ll make a difference.\nMike Pence: (51:36)\nAnd I’m going to have to blow out of here. What a great Wisconsin wind. Fantastic. But I want to thank you all for coming out today. And as you leave here today, more confident than ever, that if all of us do all that we need to do and every day between now and November 3rd, that we’re going to have a great American comeback. We’re going to have a great victory for all of the American people. And with a renewed Republican majority in the United States Senate with Congressman Brian Steil and Glenn Grothman in a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives. With President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years and with God’s help, we’re going to deliver a great victory all across Wisconsin, all across America, and we’re going to make America great again, again. Thank you all very much. God bless you and God bless America.",

         "Donald Trump: (00:00)\nHello everybody. Hello Orlando. Hello Sanford. It’s great to be with you. Thank you. It’s great to be back. That’s a lot of people. Our competitor sleepy Joe, he had a rally today and practically nobody showed up. I don’t know what’s going on. Sleepy Joe. But it’s great to be back in my home state, Florida to make my official return to the campaign trail. I am so energized by your prayers and humbled by your support. We’ve had such incredible support and here we are. Here we are. But we’re going to finish. We’re going to make this country greater than ever before.\nDonald Trump: (01:34)\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We’ve made tremendous progress. If you look at what we’re doing with therapeutics and frankly cures, we’ve made tremendous progress. And I said to my people, we are going to take whatever the hell they gave me and we’re going to distribute it around to hospitals and everyone’s going to have the same damn thing. We’ve all endured a lot together. And we are doing better by far than we ever did in 2016. The enthusiasm’s greater. The spirit is greater. We’re going to have, if it’s possible, an even greater and more important victory than we had just four years ago. And nobody ever said this fight was not going to be a hard one, but we will make it like you’ve never seen before. We are more successful now than we’ve ever been before. Our military is rebuilt.\nDonald Trump: (02:39)\nTake a look at what’s going on with our economy. I hate to say to the fake news, we’re about to hit another stock market record, 401Ks. Sleepy Joe Biden. Not a nice guy, by the way. I have to be honest. He’s not a nice guy. People say, “Oh, he’s such a nice guy.” He had a very bad day today. He had a very bad day. You saw what happened. If I ever had a day like he had today, they’d say it’s over. It’s over. No Biden had a bad day. He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. He didn’t know what state he was in. And he said today he’s a proud Democrat running for the US Senate. No you can’t. Can’t do it. It’s the second time. Can you imagine if I did that? “It’s great to be with you. It’s great to be a wonderful developer from New York.” They’d say he’s out of here. Get him out. No, Biden had a bad day. He’s got a lot of bad days coming. Look, look, we can’t play games. The one thing I know for sure, President Xi of China did us no favor. President Putin of Russia, you’re looking around. Kim Jong-un, whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un, they’re 100% sharp. We have somebody running who’s not 100%. He’s not 80%. He’s not 60%. We can’t have this as a country. We can’t have it. Joe Biden is also owned by the radical globalists, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in this ridiculous, endless wars. Set of endless wars that we’ve been in for a long time. 19 years, they’re all coming back home. You know that, right?\nDonald Trump: (04:44)\nThey’re all coming back home. Our great warriors, our great soldiers. The corrupt political class is desperate to regain their power by any means necessary. We’re the one standing in their way. We’re the one standing up for the American worker, the American family, and for the American dream. And that’s what we’re doing on this beautiful evening. This beautiful evening in Florida. Oh do I like Florida. Did we win Florida last time? Was that beautiful?\nDonald Trump: (05:17)\nEverything I hear, we’re winning by a lot. Then you turn on the fake news. They say, “The polls are tied in Florida.” I don’t get it. I don’t. We heard the same thing last year. Remember? Four years ago, we heard the same thing. ” We’re going to lose Florida,” they said four years ago, “by five points.” They called that thing so early in the evening and we won by a lot. And we’re winning by a lot more now than we were four years ago.\nDonald Trump: (05:46)\n22 days from now, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re going to make our country greater than it has ever been before. Thank you, man. Thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And I used to say it in 2016. I’m sorry, at the time I thought it was. These people are crazy. We have to win. Most important we’ve ever had. Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his party’s nomination. He’s handed control to the socialists, the Marxists and the left-wing extremists. And you know that. And he’s got no strength left. He’s got no power left. He’s got nothing going.\nDonald Trump: (06:53)\nIf he wins, the radical left will be running the country and they’re addicted to power and God help us if they ever got it, because we would never have the same country again. And you couldn’t make a comeback. You don’t make comebacks from where they’d take us. If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because frankly, I’m not a politician. I’m embarrassed by the throne. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody has ever fought for you. And I had a very nice life before this, I will tell you. And a lot easier. But I love this, that I would have never, ever change because we are doing more for this country than any administration has ever done despite the witch hunts and the phony stuff that we caught them on now. We caught them cold and we’ll see what happens with that. Just watch, stay tuned.\nDonald Trump: (08:02)\nRight now I’m fighting to make sure we eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. We’re hitting record stock market numbers, record 401Ks, record stocks, record job numbers. Don’t blow it. Don’t blow it. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your taxes. He wants to quadruple. How about where he gets caught again, he said, “Oh no, we’re not going to give a tax increase, but we’re going to terminate all of the Trump tax cuts.” Well, that’s $2,000 plus child tax credits, plus all of the other things, you’re talking about $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 a year. I don’t think Florida is going to be paying that per family. And if you add energy into that, we have energy at all time low. We’re energy independent. Nobody ever thought that was going to happen. And when you are paying less than $2 at the pump like you are, nobody ever thought you’d see those days again. And those days are here for a long time if we’re smart. We’ve been beating China. We’ve been beating everybody. Until the plague came in, we were teaching China like they’ve never been taught before and they know it. And they’ve told me that and they never thought it could happen. And we’re very soon going to be doing it again. We achieved all of this despite the fact that we caught them cold. They were spying on our campaign. It’s our campaign. It’s our campaign, not my campaign.\nDonald Trump: (09:37)\nThere was spying on our campaign and illegally trying to take down a very, very straightforward and legally sworn in administration. We were sworn in. They tried before the fact, they tried after the fact. We were an admin… And then they say, “We want to know if you will agree with a friendly transfer of power.” For four years, they’ve been trying to get us out of office. Four years they’ve been trying to get us out, but we’ll take care of it all after the election. We caught them cold. We caught them cold. Bad people, crooked Hillary.\nDonald Trump: (10:19)\nAnd by the way, Obama and Biden knew everything that was happening, okay? Just in case you had any question. We’ll take care of it after the election. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists, but that gives you another reason to go out and vote. We got to get in. Because we don’t, they’ll just sweep it under the rug. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders. You know that? Release criminal aliens, confiscate your guns. No more Second Amendment, get used to it. Destroy your suburbs and drive God from the public square. That’s what’s going to happen.\nDonald Trump: (11:04)\nYou saw in the pledge of allegiance during the Democrat National Convention. They took the word God out twice. They said, “Oh, we made a mistake. Excuse me.” And then it happened a second time. We said, “Well, I guess that wasn’t a mistake, right?” Biden even refuses to answer questions on the packing of the Supreme Court. Nobody even thought of that for many, many, many decades. And that’s what they want to do. They can’t get there legitimately. So they’re said, “That’s all right. We’ll just pack the court. We’ll put a lot of super lefties on the court and we’ll have a whole different country.” Nope. Not going to happen that way. We’re not going to let it happen. You got to get out and vote.\nDonald Trump: (11:44)\nA lot of people said that I was elected because of the Supreme Court, because I said I’m going to put great conservative, constitutionalists, great judges on the Supreme Court. I don’t know if it’s true. But if it is true, it’s more true now than it was four years ago. And you got to get out and vote because they’re going to destroy our country and they’re going to destroy our US Supreme Court, and we can’t let that happen.\nDonald Trump: (12:10)\nBut who would have thought? We’re on number three. Other presidents have never had any. They’ve never had any. We’re at three already, three and a half years. And I will say this, I will say this. It’s driving them crazy. It’s driving them crazy. And Amy is fantastic. A great intellect, a great scholar. I think she’s going to be a fantastic US Supreme Court Justice.\nDonald Trump: (12:42)\nAs America saw earlier today in Amy’s opening statement in the Senate, Judge Barrett, a brilliant scholar who will defend our laws, our rights, our freedom, and our constitution like very few people would have the capability of doing. The radical left is hell bent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They’re enraged and unhinged out of vengeance and nobody can believe what they’re doing and where they’re going, but we understand it. We understand their canceled culture. We’re not letting them cancel culture us at all. We’re proud of our country and we’re proud of our heritage.\nDonald Trump: (13:28)\nThey want to punish the middle-class, expunge every last trace of traditional values and replace the American dream with a socialist nightmare, and that’s what it is. They want to turn America into communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela, and ruin the lives of Hispanic Americans and all Americans. And I want to thank the Hispanic Americans down in Florida. You have been so incredible to Trump. Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida seniors. And by the way, Biden was a big lover of Castro. You do know that, right? And you know the deal that I broke, you saw that? Right as I came into office, Obama gave the whole planet away to Castro. And I said, “No, thank you. We’re not doing that.” That’s why we just got the Bay of Pigs award from the Cuban Americans, thank you very much. And a lot of them are here. Thank you all very much. Bay of Pigs. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know all about that. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens. Now, we all have a heart and we all want to take care of people. But what you’re doing is you’re telling millions of people to pour up into our country. We’re going to give you education. We’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you everything. We can’t do it. We can’t afford it. We can’t take care of our own people. We have to take care of our people first. And if they let that happen, you would be decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security.\nDonald Trump: (15:13)\nWhile I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare. No one will touch or hurt in any way, shape or form your Social Security. With your vote I will finish building the strongest economy the world has ever seen and we were there. Last year was the greatest year in the history of the State of Florida. And I have to say, it was practically that way for almost every state in the union. But it was Florida’s best year. The year coming is going to be, and you’re going to see a great third quarter set of numbers coming out very soon just before the election. So I’m putting myself on the spot. The third quarter numbers are going to be record setting phenomenal numbers. Next year is going to be the best year we’ve ever had economically.\nDonald Trump: (16:06)\nBut as I’ve done from the beginning, I will keep every promise and I will always put America first. You haven’t heard that, right? You haven’t heard that from other people. Under my leadership, we’re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery like nobody could even believe. And if you look at our upward path, no country in the world has recovered the way we’ve recovered economically or otherwise, not even close. And if you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that’s all we want. We want a normal life. We’ll fully resume. And the Florida tourism and hospitality industries that I know so well, will reach historic new highs. Highs like they’ve never reached before. Biden would terminate our recovery. Delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic and annihilate Florida’s economy with a draconian unscientific lockdown. That’s what he-\nDonald Trump: (17:03)\n… his economy with a draconian, unscientific lockdown. That’s what he wants to do, lock it down. Lock it down, everybody. And you know what? If you don’t feel good about going out, stay, relax, stay. You know the risk groups, you know the older people. See, fortunately, I’m not an old person. I’m very young and I’m in such perfect shape.\nDonald Trump: (17:21)\nI’m in such great shape. I said that the other day. I said, “Well, I’m very young, and I’m in great shape, perfect shape.” And they said, “Donald Trump misrepresented today, again. He said he was in great shape, that he’s very young.” These people are the sickest of them all.\nDonald Trump: (17:46)\nBut the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted the Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states, where they’re locked out, sealed up. Suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, deaths by so many different forms. You can’t do that. And I want to just congratulate the governor and everybody in Florida. You’re open and open for business and doing great.\nDonald Trump: (18:24)\nAnd we got to remember, I said it right at the beginning, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. The cure can not be worse, but if you don’t feel good about it, if you want to stay, stay, relax, stay. But if you want to get out there, get out. One thing with me, the nice part, I went through it. Now they say I’m immune. I feel so powerful. I will walk into that audience. I’ll walk in there, I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women, and everybody. I’ll just give you a big, fat kiss.\nDonald Trump: (18:59)\nNo, but there is something nice. I don’t have to be locked up in my basement, and I wouldn’t allow that to happen anyway. I wouldn’t allow it to happen. When you’re the president, you can’t lock yourself in a basement and say, “I’m not going to bother with the world.” You got to get out, and it’s risky. It’s risky, but you got to get out. But it does give you a good feeling when you can beat something, and now they say you’re immune. I don’t know for how long. Some people say for life. Some people say for four months. I mean, every time I think about it, every time I hear them, it gets shorter and shorter and shorter, because they want it to be as bad as possible. But it is a great feeling.\nDonald Trump: (19:35)\nI want to thank, by the way, Walter Reed Medical Hospital, Johns Hopkins. These guys are incredible. We’re 90% better now than we were six, seven months ago, in terms of a cure for people that get really sick, 90%. It’s incredible what’s happened. And with children is 99.9%, you’re going to be okay. You’re going to be okay. 99. 9. They have a little better immune systems, we just learned that, better than you have, better than we all have. But we love our children, but we have to get our schools open. We have to get up businesses going back. We have to get our country rolling, and it is rolling. You’re going to see that when the numbers come out.\nDonald Trump: (20:16)\nThe Biden virus plan … and you got to remember, he took H1N1, which he always calls in N1H1. He gets it mixed up. I said, “No, Joe. H comes first.” But it’s called the swine flu. Right? And his own person, his chief of staff, said that it was a disaster the way they ran it. A much less lethal problem, but a disaster, the way they ran it, a total catastrophe. It was so bad. It was so bad. And then he says, “I’m going to tell him what to do. But when I locked down China, he thought it was a terrible thing. He called me xenophobic when I locked down China, which was in January, months earlier than what he said. Then ultimately, admitted I’m right, but then he said, “Oh, he should have acted faster.”\nDonald Trump: (20:59)\nWell, this was months later that he says I should have acted … Nobody acted fast like I did. I also shut down, locked down Europe, if you remember. And the bottom line is we saved millions of lives. When this first came out, if we didn’t do a good job, they predicted 2.2 million people would die.\nDonald Trump: (21:19)\nWe’re 210,000. We shouldn’t be at one. It’s China’s fault. They allowed this to happen. They allowed it to escape China. But 2.2 million people would have died. Just remember that, just to remember that, a fact they don’t like talking about. I have such respect for the people of this country, the way they’ve handled it. It’s been an incredible love fest together. That’s really what it’s been. And sympathies from all of us, to those people who, whose family members have died, whose friends … I’ve lost friends. I’ve lost friends.\nAudience: (21:59)\nWe love you.\nDonald Trump: (22:12)\nThank you very much.\nAudience: (22:16)\nWe love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.\nDonald Trump: (22:16)\nThank you.\nAudience: (22:16)\nWe love you. We love you.\nDonald Trump: (22:17)\nThank you. You’re going to love me even more. You’re going to love me even more, because we’re years ahead on vaccines, and they’re going to be distributed very shortly. I mean, frankly, it’s a big political deal going on, where they don’t want it to be before the election. Don’t let it be. But we have great vaccines coming. Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer. I mean, we have great, great things happening with the vaccines. I think even greater with the cures and with the therapeutics. And maybe it’s why I’m here with you. Maybe it’s not, I’m not sure. I know one thing, I was very happy to take it, that I can tell you. But through Operation Warp Speed, we’re on track to have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, and they’ll be delivered by the military, and they’re all set to go. They’re waiting for final approval. And that vaccine will end the pandemic, but we’re also launching a historic effort to bring your medical supply chains back home.\nDonald Trump: (23:14)\nIn 1996, Joe Biden voted to obliterate Puerto Rico’s thriving pharmaceutical industry. Remember, they used to have a great pharmaceutical industry. He cut it out. And when he cut it out, he sent Puerto Rico into a nosedive like nobody’s ever seen before. So we’re bringing it all back, and we’re bringing it back to Florida too. We’re bringing it all the way back, taking our jobs away from China. We’re bringing it back from China. I’ll reverse. Biden’s catastrophic decision. We’ll bring it all back. The drug industry’s coming back into Puerto Rico, coming back into, by the way, Pennsylvania, coming back into North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, coming back into Michigan, coming back into Ohio. We’re bringing it all back.\nDonald Trump: (24:05)\nLast month, I also announced an additional $13 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico and for Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. My administration’s allocated over $60 billion. And if you look at Florida, where your great governors, your last two governors have been great, your two senators, great. They’re always calling, asking for money, but I guess that’s what they’re supposed to be doing. And I’m always giving it when it comes to Florida. The panhandle got hit really hard over the last two years. We took care of the panhandle. So days ago, I was honored to receive the endorsement of the governor of Puerto Rico. Can you believe that? Right? Wanda Vázquez Garced. And she was so nice. They were also joined by several great Puerto Rican community leaders, [ Jay Rosario 00:00:25:00], [Gabe Ruiz 00:08:02], [Daisy Lopezid 00:25:05], Myra Guzman-Kaslow and candidate for Congress. Dr. Leo Valentina. Please, where are you? Where are you?\nDonald Trump: (25:16)\n[inaudible 00:00:25:20]. I’m not going to say the best, but I’m just about the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. You better vote for me, Puerto Rico. You better vote. But I’ll always be fighting for Puerto Rico. It’s very unfair the way they were treated by Democrats. And while Biden will surrender your jobs to China, your country and your fellow politicians, and I have a lot of great ones right here, including your governor.\nDonald Trump: (25:58)\nWow. We will never allow ourselves to even think about surrendering to the left wing mob. They’re on the run. They’re on the run. Better not have them have a little bit of a victory, because if they have even a little victory, it’s not going to be good.\nDonald Trump: (26:18)\nI’m bringing our jobs back home and putting violent criminals behind bars. I’m working with your political leaders. We’ve also directed the FBI to immediately investigate the destruction of the Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln statues in Portland and to prosecute the offenders to the fullest extent of federal law. Biden supporters are causing mayhem in the streets. If he wins, there will be nothing but bedlam all over the place, but he’s not going to win. He may be the worst presidential candidate in history, and I got him, I got him. It actually puts more pressure on you. If you ran against a great candidate, there’s actually less pressure. You want to know the truth.\nAudience: (27:07)\nFour more years.\nDonald Trump: (27:07)\nThank you.\nAudience: (27:07)\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\nDonald Trump: (27:07)\nThank you.\nAudience: (27:07)\nFour more years. Four more years.\nDonald Trump: (27:17)\nNo, we want to keep our country great. We’re bringing it to a level that it’s never been. Our military has equipment the likes of which nobody has ever seen, no country has ever seen, all made in the USA, rockets, missiles, tanks, ships, the likes of which, jet fighters, bombers, tankers, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. Our nuclear arsenal is the strongest by far in the world, the strongest it’s ever been. And hope to God, we never have to even think about using it. And the way you won’t have to use it is to have it.\nDonald Trump: (27:54)\nAt our debate, Biden could not name a single law enforcement organization that supports him, not one, and that’s because … And by the way, did Vice President Mike Pence do a great job?\nAudience: (28:06)\n[crosstalk 00:28:06].\nDonald Trump: (28:06)\nRight? [inaudible 00:28:07]. Did a great job. But it’s because Biden and Harris, that’s another great one. There was nobody so mean to Biden than her, nobody. And so, brilliantly, I said he can’t pick her, because nobody treated him as badly. Although I will say this, had Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren got out prior to Super Tuesday, we would have had Bernie instead. But I’d rather have Biden, because he’s now alienated the left. He’s alienated the right. Nobody knows what the hell he stands for. How about Pennsylvania?\nDonald Trump: (28:51)\nHe goes to Pennsylvania. For a year-and-a-half, he’s against fracking. The day he gets the nomination, through a little luck, because she didn’t get out. So she took all of Bernie’s votes, right? But following day, he said, “I’m in favor of fracking.” But he’s not. And it doesn’t matter, because the radical left will never let Pennsylvania and Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Ohio, never let them frack. That’s over with.\nDonald Trump: (29:22)\nBut can you imagine? And the press, which is fake and corrupt, the press never said … Have you ever heard him asked? No. Have you ever heard him asked once, “Well, wait a minute. For one year, you said there will be no fracking.” And he said it strongly, right? You know, “Read my lips.” Right? To use an old expression, “Read my lips, there will be no fracking.” That didn’t work out too well. So now he goes, and he says there will be fracking. Not once have I heard the question. Not once have I asked why Hunter was able to take $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Not once have I heard these frauds back there. Not once have I heard the fake news. Not once have I heard him say, “A billion dollars. If you don’t change that prosecutor, you’re not getting the billion dollars.” And then he goes, “Whoa, the prosecutor was changed.” The prosecutor against his son. Not once have I heard them talking about that question. Can you imagine if we did that?\nDonald Trump: (30:27)\nAnd on top of everything else, the Democrat Party declared war on our great police and law enforcement. That’s what it is. So I proudly received the endorsements of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the National Latino Police Officers Association, the Florida police chiefs and all of these incredible organizations, plus all over the country. And when I asked him, “Name one organization, give me one organization.” During our debate, where he was saved by the moderator about four times, he couldn’t answer it. Name one law enforcement organization. He couldn’t name one. Then I said, “Say the words, law enforcement, just say it.” Couldn’t do it. He couldn’t say it.\nDonald Trump: (31:26)\nWe’re joined tonight by a great group of people, warriors, really warriors. He came to me a couple of years ago. He said, “Sir, I want to run for governor.” I said, “Ron, I don’t know. Do they know you well enough?” But he was a great defender and a brilliant guy, Harvard, Yale, top of his class, smart as hell. Nobody knows how smart. Don’t tell too many people. He likes to catch you by surprise. But he’s a great, great guy, and he’s been a great friend. I said, “All right, I’ll endorse you.” I endorsed him, and the rest … he went like a rocket ship, and he handled the pressure. And his wife, Casey, is better than him. I’ve been saying it for a long time. Governor Ron De Santis and Casey.\nDonald Trump: (32:15)\nGreat guy. Great, great couple. Great, great couple. Smart, brilliant. Sit down, please. Really, they’re a great group of people. Those people are great, and he surrounds himself with incredible people, with the exception, of course, of Representative Matt Gaetz.\nDonald Trump: (32:33)\nOh, Matt Gaetz. You talk about a warrior, right? Ron, what do you think, huh? Matt Gaetz is a great man, a great gentleman, and what a future he has. I don’t know about swap it, but I think I might. Thank you, Matt. Thank you.. Thank you both for being here. Appreciate it.\nDonald Trump: (32:55)\nJohn Rutherford. Where is John? John? Thank you, John. Mike Waltz. Mike, thank you. Thank you. Nice couple. Gus Bilirakis. Gus? Gus? Congressional candidate, somebody who’s supposed to be potentially a superstar. Now, we’ve heard that a lot. Sometimes it works out. It’s going to in his case, Scott Franklin. Scott? Thank you. Oh, he’s got the look. He could be. That’s good. That’s good. I hear good things, Scott. Going well? How’s he doing, Ron? He’s doing good? Ron says you’re doing good. Good. You got to win it. Thank you, Scott, very much. Kimberly. Where’s Kimberly? Kimberly? Thank you. I watched you coming in, speaking. I said, “That’s a lot to follow.” Kimberly is great. I want to thank Kimberly.\nDonald Trump: (33:57)\nAnd finally, we’re joined by a group of amazing supporters who recently walked away from the Democrats and will be …\nDonald Trump: (34:03)\n… supporters who recently walked away from the Democrats and will be voting for us. We have a lot of, a lot of them. And a lot of them in law enforcement, a lot of law enforcement, they were democrats, in some cases they left their party. In other cases, they just said, “No, we’re voting for Trump.” I said, “Why are you doing that?” “We have no choice.” I said, “You’re right, you’re right.” But nobody’s been better to law enforcement than I have. You know when I first came in, we gave away hundreds of millions of dollars of military equipment that was in storage. Wasn’t doing anybody any good, it was collecting dust, probably paying rent all over the place. That’s probably why they had it, come to think of it. But look how far that crowd goes back. Hey, hey cameras, will you please? Oh man, look at that. Man. That’s into those hangers. Wow.\nAudience: (35:12)\nU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nDonald Trump: (35:13)\nYou know, these are the real polls. So when did you hear about this meeting, like a day ago, these are the real polls, right? The other guy gets out there and he’s … they work at work and work and 30 people show up. They put them in those crazy circles, right? They only have the circles because that’s the only way they can fill up the room, it’s true. But that’s a fantastic group of people, thank you. Same thing over here. I wish the fake news would turn the cameras. For a long time, I didn’t think the cameras moved that way, but then anytime there was a little sign of problems, they could twist around like a pretzel and I realized they could. But they don’t like to show those crowds, but that is a massive amount. I don’t know how many people are here, but you got a lot. I want to thank you. So this evening, we’re also praying for all of the families on the Florida Panhandle effected by Hurricane Sally. And I will tell you, Ron and Marco, and everybody, I’ll tell you, Rick, everybody’s been calling and calling.\nDonald Trump: (36:20)\nMatt Gates has been going … driving us a little crazy. Matt, you can take it a little easy. But that’s what somebody that’s good is supposed to do, right? You’re supposed to call. But we take care of the Panhandle and we’re doing it at a level that’s never been done before. And I’ve done it, I think I can say right from the beginning, right? I tell the story about Ron DeSantis. He came to see me, he just became governor. “We had a hurricane. Sir, thank you very much for the money you send to the Panhandle in Florida. I appreciate it.” “Good, Ron, good. I hope it’s enough. Good, spend it well.” I get a call like three days later. “Sir, could I see you?” Now, I’m in Washington. I say, “You don’t have to come up, tell me.” “No, no, no, it’s very important. Sir,” comes into the oval office, “Sir, could we have an extra $500 million?” I said, “Ron, will it ever end, Ron?” And one thing I found out, it never ends for the Panhandle and for Ron, but we take care of it, right, Ron? We take care of it.\nDonald Trump: (37:19)\nGreat, great people, you have great people. They’re warriors, I’ll tell you. They’re warriors, they’re fighters. We need more people like that, I will tell you. Last month they approved a major disaster declaration for the state of Florida. And I’ll be with you through every step of the rebuilding and you’ll be hit with others. The one thing we know about Florida, you’re very good at this stuff. You get hit by hurricanes and you rebuild, and you rebuild fast, and it’s incredible. I’ve watched, I’ve watched and you don’t want much help either. You’re proud people, you’re incredible people. You put it back together. But we’re there for you all the way. And were there monetarily and we’re there with FEMA. And I think Ron, FEMA’s been incredible, haven’t they, right? Yeah, they’ve been incredible. Thank you to FEMA. We have a lot of FEMA people here, right over there.\nDonald Trump: (38:03)\nWe spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden has inflicted over the last 47 years with that ridiculous, dumb thought NAFTA, T.P.P., and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, a disaster for our country. China is considered a developing nation. I stopped that. China’s considered a develop … in other words, China, they’re so wonderful they’re developing, isn’t that nice? Now by being a developing nation, they get much more benefits than a nation that’s not a developing. So I said, “Well, we’re a developing nation too, if they’re a developing nation.” And we just won, you know this, we just won seven and a half billion dollars from the World Trade Organization. And from the World Health Organization, I took us out. They said, “Why did you do that?” I said, “Number one, they were wrong on everything.” Although, they corrected themselves today and they said I was right for the lockdowns. But I said, “Number two, why are we paying 500 million a year? And China, which has one point four billion people is paying 39 million a year, explain that?” They couldn’t explain, it was very hard to explain. So I took us out for that and other reasons, okay. So we’ll see what happens with that.\nDonald Trump: (39:22)\nBut these are the deals. I could go over hundreds of different things with you and just common sense. I mean, common sense, what we do. Think of it, World Health Organization, we spend … we have 325 million people, we spend $500 million. China spends $39 million and China dominates them. I said, “Doesn’t work that way anymore, doesn’t work that way anymore.” They’ll take us back in so fast at much less money. For decades, our politicians spend trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, and our factory, and our troops back home to the U.S.A. But those dismal days of betrayal and that’s what we were, we were betrayed by our own politicians, whether it was on purpose, or that they were just plain stupid. We’ll come back with unprecedented force if Washington Democrats are allowed to take control again, we can’t let it happen. You have got to get out and vote.\nDonald Trump: (40:54)\nSleepy Joe Biden, and it wasn’t him, it’s the people that control him. He’s controlled totally. Has put forward the most radical platform in American history, including a plan to eliminate U.S. borders. Oh, that’s wonderful, where’s our border? We don’t have one, just come in, everybody come on in, come on in everybody. If you’re a murderer, if you’re a rapist, if you’re very, very sick with a disease that can spread all over, just come on in. We’re up to almost 400 miles of wall, nobody talks about that anymore. And we now have the tightest, safest border in our country’s history, but we’re up to almost 400 miles, it’ll be finished very soon. And it’s top of the line. It’s exactly what border patrol wanted. But by implementing nationwide catch and release, imposing deadly sanctuary cities nationwide, nationwide, they want sanctuary cities, that’s what they want. I don’t even think … I’ll tell you, I know a lot of people in California, they don’t want sanctuary cities. It’s like the politicians want it. I don’t think the people want it.\nDonald Trump: (41:59)\nBut they want to suspend all removals of illegals out of our country, whether they’re murderers, rapists, thugs, bank robbers, they don’t care. They want to suspend it. You almost say, where the hell are they coming from? Where does it even … where does the thought process come? It’s demented. It would mean the total nullification of all U.S. borders, overwhelming every city and town in America, including this wonderful place that we all love very much. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history and we’re finishing that wall. It’s going to be finished and so beautiful, wait’ll you see that. Wait’ll see that. A few more months. We’re doing 10 miles a day. And by the way, Mexico is paying, they hate to say it. Mexico is paying for it. And Mexico’s been great. Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our border. And I said, you have to do that, otherwise we’re going to have to charge you tariffs because we’re not going to stand for it. When people are pouring into our … and we have the worst laws because Congress over the years has made it so weak.\nDonald Trump: (43:09)\nIf you’re a soldier and you talk rudely to somebody, they ended up giving you the electric chair, okay? It’s so horrible. Mexico has been great. 27,000 soldiers we have, see, 27. Now the electric chair comment, they’ll put that, “He’s exaggerating. He shouldn’t do that.” They are sick people. But it is true, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our border and you know what, they don’t play games. They don’t let them through. And if they do let them through, we get very angry with Mexico. So Mexico’s been great. The president of Mexico’s been great. We’re putting a border tax on for cars and trucks that go across. It will much more than pay for our wall, starting soon. Remember when the old days we used to say, we’ll build the wall, everybody thought there was no way. It’s one of the largest projects in the history of our country, because you’re talking about a lot of miles, 540 miles. And then we may even add some more into other areas where you probably, you have natural barriers like mountains and rivers, and a lot of other pretty tough areas. But we may even add some more. We’re doing so great with it, 10 miles a day.\nDonald Trump: (44:17)\nAnd I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers, you’ve been incredible. Some of them are here, they’re very proud people. One thing with the Army Corps, they may build it a little expensive, but you can’t rip that sucker down and it never [inaudible 00:00:44:30]. That’ll never come down. We ended the catch and release ridiculous program where you catch somebody, you take their name, and then you release them. And you say, come back in three years to a court case. And nobody ever comes back, except for the really dumb ones, they come back on occasion. But nobody ever comes back, they’re in our country. They could be murderers and they could be all sorts of problems and we’re not having that. We ended it. We stopped asylum fraud and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members, including MS-13. Brought them back to their country. We brought them back to their country. We’ve now deported over a half a million criminal illegal aliens, think of that, think of that.\nDonald Trump: (45:18)\nAnd outside of poorly run Democrat states and cities, you don’t have crime in this country. Our country is doing fantastically. And I call up governors in Portland, and I call up from the state and I call up the governor, as an example, Oregon. I say, “We’d love to send some people to help you out with Oregon and to help you out with Portland. We’ll solve the problem in a half an hour, like we did in Minnesota with Minneapolis. We’ll solve the problem quickly.” Remember Minneapolis was burning down, day after day and I’d call, let us come in, let us come in. Anyway, they finally came in. How long did it take? About a half an hour. Remember the beautiful scene, they lined up. They weren’t socially distanced, but that’s okay. They lined up, then another line, another line. Then they just walk forward and that was the end of that. And I think we’re going to win the state of Minnesota because of it, I think.\nDonald Trump: (46:17)\nHasn’t been won since 1972, but it’s looking like we’re going to win Minnesota because of it because nobody, I mean what they did. But I give the governor credit, at least, even though it was too long, he let us in. Oregon, we have to send in the troops. We will solve that problem in 30 minutes. We sent in the U.S. Marshals. Recently, when the man, this horrible human being shot somebody and killed them in the middle of the street. Two days went by, three days went by, I said, “Why hasn’t he been arrested?” We sent in the U.S Marshals. In 15 minutes it was all over, 15 minutes. Be so easy to do. I mean, can you imagine these people for years and years, it’s been anarchy in Portland, for years and years. But not for the Republicans. This is why you cannot have the Democrats and that whole philosophy, that whole craziness, you can not have them involved in running your country.\nDonald Trump: (47:13)\nWe invested two point five trillion dollars in the U.S. military, including funding to save Tyndall Air Force Base, because who knows Tyndall. Who is … well, not that big a group. That’s not like a big group. I can tell you if you were in the Panhandle, you’d be saying, thank you very much. It was wiped out by the hurricane and Ron called, and a number of people called, and Marco called, Rick Scott called, they all called. They wanted to save Tyndall and we did it. And now it’s brand new, gorgeous, and really moving along well, right? We did a good job there, I think so. We launched the first new branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in nearly 75 years called Space Force, very [important 00:48:02].\nDonald Trump: (48:09)\nFor an administration, if you think of it, so not for 75 years, we’ve created a new force, right? The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. So think of it, Coast Guard. And now we just created a new force, first time at 75 years, if I did nothing but that, that’s a big deal. And that’s peanuts, that’s peanuts. Because we built the greatest economy in history. We cut taxes more than any other president by far in history. We cut regulations, which I think is maybe just as important as the taxes, that’s why our businesses are roaring back. We’ve done things that nobody else has done, nobody else has. And these people back here, they don’t even challenge me on it, which is shocking. Usually you think they’d challenge you, even if they’re wrong. I also brought back NASA, the greatest space center, again, in the world. And we passed V.A. Choice and V.A. Accountability for our great vets, right?\nDonald Trump: (49:08)\nAnd we just got a 91% approval rating, Ron. 91% approval rating by the vets on the way we’re running it, never happened before. That’s never happened before, Rick, never happened before. We killed the leader of ISIS who was trying to reform ISIS because we blew it into oblivion. We killed al-Baghdadi, they were looking for him for years and years and years. Guess who got him? We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many, many people all over the world, Qasem Soleimani, he’s dead, gone. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, which was a catastrophe. President Obama give us $150 billion and we’ll give you nothing. Give us one point eight billion in green, in cash. He gave him one point eight billion in cash. That’s when I realized how powerful the presidency is, when you could do that. What a horrible deal.\nDonald Trump: (50:14)\nBut we broke the deal, and I’ll tell you probably the first call I’ll get after we win the election will be from Iran dying to make a deal because they’re down 28% GDP, nobody’s ever heard of a thing like that. That’ll be the first call I get. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And every president promised to do it. Every president said they were going to do that for many, many decades. They all were going to do that. Nobody did it because once they got in office, there was a lot of pressure on you not to do it. I could tell you, I was called by every foreign leader, “Please don’t do it. Please don’t do-”\nDonald Trump: (51:03)\nNot to do it. I can tell you I was called by every foreign leader. Please don’t do it. Please don’t do it. I tell the story. I said, listen, tell them, I’ll call them back in a couple of days. Then, I did it. I called him back. Hey, what’s up?\nDonald Trump: (51:13)\nI also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they’ve been working on that. They’ve been working on that for 52 years. They couldn’t get anything. Every year, people would fly in, stay, wine, dine, have a good time and leave. Nothing would happen. 52 years. I got it done in one day. Instead of these endless wars, we’re forging peace in the Middle East and peace without blood all over the sand, and you see what’s happening. In fact, a point that they didn’t report, I’ve been, I guess three or four, maybe now, Nobel Peace Prizes. Can you believe it? Four, three. I told a story. I told my wife. Oh, we’re going to have a great time. We’re going to watch television. I just got nominated for the Nobel Prize. And then I turned on the fake news. Story after story. They talk about your weather in the panhandle run. They talk about this. Story after story. No mention. Remember, when Obama got it right at the beginning and he didn’t even know why he got it? It was the biggest story you’ve ever seen. The last administration made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro dictatorship that betrayed the Cuban people and enriched the communist regime. They’re not enriched any longer. My opponent stands with socialists and communists. He wants to give everything away to Cuba. He wants to give it away to Nicaragua and Venezuela, not going to happen, not going to happen, not going to happen. I stand with the people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom.\nDonald Trump: (53:05)\nThe last administration also negotiated the terrible Obama-Biden Santos steel with Colombian drug cartels. They surrendered the narco terrorists. They surrendered totally gave up to him and that caused illicit drugs and illicit drugs all over this country. Joe Biden even received the endorsement of Colombian socialists, Gustavo Petro, a former member of the M19 Guerrilla organization, and he took it, because you know why, he didn’t know who the hell it was. He said, I’ll take it. I’ll take whoever. And I said, no, he’s a bad guy, Joe. He’s actually a bad guy.\nDonald Trump: (53:42)\nUnder my administration, we worked with Colombian officials to seize or disrupt 227 metric tons of poisonous narcotics since April, and we’re doing fantastically in terms of bringing it down, 19% reduction. My heart will always be with the Colombian people and the people from Cuba and the people from Venezuela and Nicaragua and all of the people that are so unfairly treated, and you’ll see a lot of great things happen.\nDonald Trump: (54:13)\nI did more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. And now he’s pushing the most far left agenda ever foot forward by a Presidential nominee or candidate. The Biden Plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. You’re going to have nothing left, this crazy new Green New Deal. The Green New Deal. I mean, what’s that all about? Biden’s running mate sponsored The Green New Deal and the Socialist Healthcare takeover. You’re going to have Socialist Healthcare. You don’t feel well? Okay. Go to the hospital. Stay there for about four weeks. They’ll shut down american energy, shut down fracking and outlaw the private health insurance plans of over 180 million Americans who love those plans.\nDonald Trump: (55:04)\nBiden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions. He agreed to this with crazy Bernie Sanders. He’s going to surge admissions into our country by agreed number 700%. No, thank you. Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism, and I don’t like to speak too loud, but we’re not doing too badly, are we?\nDonald Trump: (55:32)\nHe’ll ban school choice. He’ll ban charter schools and he’ll ban Florida opportunity scholarships, which is a big deal, a big deal. He wants to put him out of business run. In a second term, I’ll provide school choice to every parent in America.\nDonald Trump: (55:52)\nA vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And I just have to say in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s ending. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which you’re already doing. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second Amendment.\nDonald Trump: (56:36)\nWe will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible and very, very stupid foreign wars against countries that you’ve never even heard of. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It’s already signed and it takes place on January 1st, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by 50, 60, 70, and even 80%.\nDonald Trump: (57:44)\nWe will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. Republicans will always protect. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and it’s going to be very soon.\nDonald Trump: (58:10)\nWe will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ” in God we trust.” For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now, you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida.\nDonald Trump: (59:22)\nSo, get out there and vote. Send in your absentee ballot if you’ve requested one. Be very careful, a lot of shenanigans going on. You see what’s happening. Every day you’re reading it. In person early voting begins next week. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You have no choice. You have to do it. True. You got to do it.\nDonald Trump: (59:44)\nWe’re going to win Florida big. We’re going to win a lot of states big. We’re leading in Arizona. We’re leading in Nevada. We think we’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading all over the place. We got to have this be a big win. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Pensacola to Miami, and from Jacksonville to right here in Sanford, we stand on the shoulders of Florida Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes across the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, lay down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and from here in this beautiful state, landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon.\nDonald Trump: (01:00:51)\nWe made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country. We’re returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when Ron DeSantis comes to my office in Washington, the magnificent oval office, and he says to me, sir, sir, the people of Florida, they’ve won too much. They’re getting tired of winning. I’m going to look at him. I’m going to say Mr. Governor, go back and tell them, don’t worry about it. You’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. That’s what they want to do. We’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Because we’re one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Thank you very much. Thank you.",

         "Vice President Joe Biden: (00:00)\nIt’s good to be back. Thank you. Thank you. It’s good to be back, Mr. Mayor, in this former terminal museum. I tell you what, this is a magnificent facade, isn’t it? I understand that a few marriage proposals were made by standing in that corner and whispering to someone in the other corner.\nVice President Joe Biden: (00:26)\nMr. Mayor, thank you for the passport into the city. Thank you for your friendship. I was looking around for it. I couldn’t see you in the light. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you for… The Mayor is very good friends with a fellow who, one of the brightest, most decent men I know, who occupies my seat in the United States Senate, Senator Chris Coons. They were Truman scholars together. And you guys seem like you’re cut from the same cloth. Thank you very, very much for your support. I appreciate it, Mr. Mayor\nVice President Joe Biden: (00:59)\nAnd Kate, you’re something else. Now, Kate, you know, there’s an old joke. A long time ago, particular senator said to me, this is back when I was much younger, I was in my second term, running for my second term. He said, “Joe, I’ll come to Delaware for you and campaign for you or against you, whichever will help the most.” My offer still holds. I hope my endorsement didn’t hurt you. But all kidding aside, Kate, we need you in the US Congress. And I really mean it. And the reason I say that is you’re a healthcare advocate, a cancer survivor, a mom, and we need leaders like you representing the people in the First District. People who understand what’s going on every day, the discussions that take place around the kitchen table in the morning. Our families are still struggling trying to figure out what to do. And Joyce, thank you for that introduction. Before I begin, let me say that I’m saddened to hear that one of my baseball heroes, Joe Morgan, second baseman, Red’s legend, Hall of Famer and a good man passed away. And my condolences to the Morgan family and his teammates and to his fans here in Cincinnati and all across the country. He played one year on the Philadelphia Phillies.\nVice President Joe Biden: (02:29)\nNow, I’m going to get myself in real trouble, but I have a bad habit of telling you the truth. I happened to grow up in a household in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where, if you wanted to have dinner, you had to be Yankees fan because that was the farm called, the Triple A ball club was a Yankee ball club. And my grandpop was an All-American football player, but he was a great Yankees fan. But it wasn’t hard back in those days. There was Whitey Ford and a few others, but in Delaware, if you are not a Phillies fan, and let me put this way, if I were not a Phillies fan, I’d be sleeping alone. My wife’s a Philly girl. You think I’m kidding. I’m not.\nVice President Joe Biden: (03:14)\nBut Joe actually played for a year in the Phillies if my memory serves me correctly, but he had fans all over the country. It’s amazing to be both the heart when he was a second baseman, and the voice as one of the great baseball announcers in history, of the same club. I mean, that’s a pretty incredible accomplishment. And so, my best to his family and to his fans, and he has fans all across the country.\nVice President Joe Biden: (03:45)\nFolks, as my football coach says, “Go time, Joe.” It’s go time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes, not because I’m running, because what’s at stake. The next president is going to determine not just the next four years, but what the next decade or more is going to look like because there’s such a stark fundamental difference. And you here in Cincinnati can make all the difference and all the difference in Ohio.\nVice President Joe Biden: (04:23)\nI learned a long time ago coming out to Ohio that you win Ohio from Cincinnati north. Head north. Well, you are the starting gate, and I love being back here. And again, what a beautiful museum and terminal this is. I spent a lot of time, as I was telling the Mayor, in train stations.\nVice President Joe Biden: (04:46)\nWhen I first got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29. I was in Washington and interviewing my first staff using Senator Kennedy’s whip office. And I got a phone call from a first responder saying my wife and daughter had just been killed, and my two boys were really badly injured, and not sure they were going to make it. My fire department, and God, I love my fire service, took about three hours and the jaws of life to get my kids out of the car because they were broadsided by a tractor trailer. And I didn’t want any part of going to the United States Senate. My sister managed my campaign, and my younger sister and my much younger brother raised all the money we raised, $187,000. We went to our governor to determine who would they pick in my spot because I didn’t plan on going. A lot of really fine men who were in the Senate at the time, and Republicans and Democrats came to me and said, “Just come and stay for six months and help us organize.”\nVice President Joe Biden: (06:05)\nAnd so I started commuting every day back and forth, and that’s how I got involved as sort of Mr. Amtrak. Because when they publish that, they keep fastidious records on how many miles you travel on government aircraft when your vice president. And I had traveled a little over, I think it was a 1,400,000 miles. It was on the front page of the paper, but I used to like to take the train home on Fridays still as Vice President because it costs a lot of money to take that small plane back. But in addition to that, the Secret Service felt much more secure if I wasn’t on a train, but they humored me and let me go home on Fridays sometimes. My mom was living at my home as she was passing.\nVice President Joe Biden: (06:58)\nAnd I remember getting on the train and a guy named Angelo Negrea, I got to know their families, all the conductors and all the people all those years. And he came up to me and he grabbed me and he said, “Joey.” He grabbed my cheek. I was thought the Secret Service was going to shoot him. I said, “No.” I said, “He’s okay.” It’s a true story. And he said, “I just read, Joey, 1,400,000 miles on Air Force Two, big deal. The boys, we were checking. We had our retirement dinner. Went up to New Jersey for the dinner. You know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?” I said, “No, Ang, I don’t.” He said, “Joey,” he said, “we figure 117 days a year, 36 years, and then X number of days as Vice President, you’ve traveled 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak.” I think I hold the record, other than a conductor.\nVice President Joe Biden: (07:53)\nAnd so they gave me a key to the engine because I can… I’m the only one I know of. I’m not supposed to say that, but I got it hidden. My point is that, as a sidelight, one of the ways we’re going to revive this economy is we’re going to end up moving high speed rail and commuter rail across this country in a way that we haven’t done before.\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:14)\nBut the reason I went home was the same reason why all you do, or try to, and that is to be there in the evening when my kids went to bed. In the morning, my son, Beau, my son, Hunter, and my daughter, Ashley, get them back to school in the morning on the way to the station, and then when they got older, it wasn’t the case, but gets to kiss them goodnight. And as they kid, “I know, Dad, we got to say three Hail Marys and God bless our troops.” So for 36 years we did this, 250 miles roundtrip.\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:50)\nAnd folks, you know, it’s really one way that I’ve said this before and I apologize for the press that travels with me for repeating it, but as I’d ride home-\nVice President Joe Biden: (09:03)\n… that travels with me, from repeating it, but as I ride home at night, and usually I could get the seven o’clock, the last fast train. Now they call it the [cell oh 00:00:11] . It was then called the Metro, was at seven o’clock and I’d ride. You get outside the Beltway exit and you ride by all these neighbors. I look into windows and wonder, literally sitting there, looking out the window. What are those parents talking about at that dining room table tonight? What are they doing before, they put their kids to bed, right after they put the kids to bed and come back and sit down. My guess is they’re talking about the same things that we talked about all across the country, and we’re talking about today. They’re asking questions, and one of theirs, as profound as they’re ordinary. “Are we going to be okay? Are going to make it?”\nVice President Joe Biden: (09:50)\n“What are we going to do? Who’s going to tell her we don’t have the money to go back to that community college. Who’s going to, you got to drive another 1000 miles on those bald tires. We just don’t have the money right now to get four new tires.” This election is about answering those kinds of questions. Who’s on their side? My dad used to have an expression for real. My dad, he didn’t have work when coal died and Scranton. My dad was a salesperson. He wasn’t a coal miner. My great-grandfather was a mining engineer, but my dad used to say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay’, and mean it.”\nVice President Joe Biden: (10:43)\nThat’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. It’s what I grew up with, surrounded by hard work and families and Scranton, Pennsylvania. When my dad had to move to Delaware, took us home to my grandpa for a year, but we finally got down. We got together again. That’s the discussions we had in Claymont and Scranton, like here in Cincinnati, but times are hard. Unemployment is up, due to the pandemic and economic outlook remains very uncertain and very mishandled. Across Ohio, and in this country folks are worried about making their next rent payment or mortgage payment, whether or not they’re going to be out in the street, whether or not they can purchase that prescription drug they need, or how much food they can put on the table.\nVice President Joe Biden: (11:38)\nMaking hard choices. Worry about whether the school their child is enrolled in, is going to be able to be open or what do they do if I still have a job, but I have a young child? If I go to work and their school’s not open, who takes care of them? How do we do that? They see the people at the top doing better and better, even in the midst of this God-awful recession, while they’re left to wonder. I mean, this sincerely, they’re have to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me?” That’s Donald Trump’s presence. 215,000 people dead from COVID-19. Experts are telling us, we may lose up to another 200,000 lives, by end of January, all because the president is only worried about one thing, the stock market, because he refused to follow science.\nVice President Joe Biden: (12:54)\nIt’s estimated that if we just wore masks, the mask I just took off to speak. Experts tell us, we could save between now and the end of the year, 100,000 lives. The president knew back in January. I think it was the 28th of January, when the intelligence community kept telling him how serious this pandemic would be. He knew it was extremely dangerous, an extremely communicable disease, airborne, but he didn’t tell anybody. But out of his desire to try to get Bob Woodward, to write something good about him, he did a long interview with Woodward, a famous journalist, and he went on record, on tape. He’s taped as saying, Trump is, that he knew how dangerous this disease was, but he did and said nothing except praise she, for the great service he was performing, how transparent he was.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:07)\nAsk yourself, why did he not tell the country? Or what, how much better off would it be, had he told the country. He said nothing. He told Bob Woodward, they didn’t want to panic the American public. Americans don’t panic. Trump panicked. Trump is the one who panicked, his reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis, as well, has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is president, the more reckless he gets. Dr. Fauci, the most respected person in this area, in the country, referred to the president’s announcement event, for the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden as a super-spreader event, publicly criticizing him.\nVice President Joe Biden: (15:06)\nHow is the president of responding? He’s running a national ad here in Cincinnati and all across the country, quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Dr. Fauci said, back in March, referring to public health officials, “I can’t imagine anybody could be doing more,” referring to public health officials. But Trump and his campaign were very much used to deception and not telling the truth. Deliberately lie by putting Fauci in his ad, implying that Fauci was talking about Trump, saying he doesn’t know how anybody could do any better. Fauci, after he saw the ad, he went public. You’ve probably seen it on the nightly news. He came after that and he said, “I did not get permission for that quote to be used, and it wasn’t about the president.” Even after he said that, and the point, I listened to your talk, even after he said that, look what happened.\nVice President Joe Biden: (16:22)\nThey continued to lie. They said, “We’re keeping it in the ad.” Same ad that says, I’m going to increase taxes on middle-class folks, with the same amount of credibility. Look, they use the ad knowing it’s a lie. Can you remember any other major, mainstream presidential candidate ever doing something like these things? As a consequence of months of overwhelming lying, misleading, irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are going to be around the dinner table tonight, because of their negligence? How many? How many brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, uncles, aunts, moms, dads are gone?\nVice President Joe Biden: (17:16)\nFolks, we’re so much better than this. Despite the crisis we face, we have an enormous opportunity. Like America’s done, unlike any other country, after every crisis, we’ve always come out of the crisis stronger than we were before we went in. That’s the uniqueness of who we are. We now have an opportunity to build back and build back better, to get everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead, begin to reward work, not just wealth. For example, for communities of color here in Cincinnati and all across the country, the question is, “How do we break the cycle, wherein good times, they lag. In bad times, they get hit first and harder?”\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:03)\n… where in good times they lag. In bad times, they get hit first and hardest. In a recovery, they’re the last and toughest to bounce back. The answer is justice, justice, criminal justice, police reforms. I know this nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong on it to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning, which is never justified. We have no need though for armed militia roaming the streets. We should have no tolerance for extremist White supremacist groups menacing our communities.\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:49)\nEven reading what’s happening up in Michigan. The Governor is a good friend. They were in her driveway with assault weapons, standing there, because you can open carry in their state, attempting to intimidate. Remember, in, I was going to call it a debate, but the shouting match he engaged in, when he was asked by a Fox reporter, not a left wing somebody or other, would he condemn White supremacy, he never answered the question. I said, “What about those guys that you in fact talk about all the time,” those boys he talks about? He said, “Well, I would just tell them to stand back and stand by.” Neighborhoods I worked in, in the Black community in Delaware, that’s called a dog whistle. You say we should trust the American law enforcement authorities to their job as I do then let them do their job without extremest groups acting as vigilantes.\nVice President Joe Biden: (20:11)\nIf you say we have no need to face racial injustice in this country you haven’t opened your eyes to what’s been going on in this country and has for a long time. I decided to run for President and I hadn’t planned on it for real, but I decided to run when I saw those folks marching out of the fields in Charlottesville. Close your eyes and you remember what you saw on television? These White supremacist, Nazi sympathizers, carrying Nazi flags using the exact same jargon used, anti-Semitic jargon used as it was used in Germany in the ’30s, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan and the Grand Kleagle saying, “This is why we elected him,” and a young woman ends up being killed. And I asked the President, “What do you think?” He said something no President has ever said, mark it down, ever said, “There are very fine people on both sides.”\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:28)\nThere have been very powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months. I’ve spent some time more, than one time, with George Floyd’s family and his little daughter, Gianna. And I knelt down to say hi to her and she said in a soft voice, “Daddy,” my word, this is a quote, “Daddy changed the world.” I also got to know Jacob Blake’s mom and dad and the whole family. Know what she said, she said, “Violence didn’t reflect her son,” that this nation needed healing, to stop the rioting, peacefully march, but there’s no justification for violence. One of the things that I’ve found, I’ve been in the civil rights arena for a long time and found pretty moving, was Doc Rivers, the basketball coach choking back tears. Remember what he said a couple of weeks ago? “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung,” continuing the quote. “It’s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country doesn’t love us back.”\nVice President Joe Biden: (22:52)\nThink about that. Think about what it takes for a Black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country that for far too long has never been fully recognized. Trump talks about the lack of systemic racism and this is the first administration we’ve never met, “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men,” we’ve never met that standard. But every generation has moved closer and closer and closer to inclusion. It’s the first one, elected President, to deliberately try to turn it back in a big way. With all due respect, I think we need in America’s leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, open the lines of communication, and bring us back together to heal and to hope. As President, that’s precisely what I will do. That’s a President’s job, but it just goes beyond the issue of police-community relations.\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:14)\nIt goes about being able to compete and build wealth. It’s about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability, families of color building wealth, and being able to pass it down, like my Irish-Catholic folks were able to do in Scranton, coming up from nothing. You build home equity, you got something to pass on. For example, another example is more and more women are dropping out of the workforce in this recession whether they’re in a city or in the suburbs. I have a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly. Testing, tracing, masking, not politicizing the race for a vaccine, a plan for its safe and equitable distribution, providing funding for PPE, the protective equipment and other resources for schools and businesses to be able to reopen safely. If you notice, the president said, when he was asked about his responsibility, he said, “I take no responsibility.” That was a quote. ” I take no responsibility.”\nVice President Joe Biden: (25:33)\nNo national standard has been set by this administration. Mr. Mayor, you’re doing on your own, or with your Governor or others in the community. We have to do so much and we can do so much. Ease the caregiving crisis for so many families experiencing now. That squeeze between raising your kids while caring for an aged loved one. It’s real. Protect your healthcare in the middle of this pandemic. Why do so many Republicans today have time told a hearing on the Supreme Court with 22 days left to go instead of providing significant economic recovery and needs for the people who are hurting so badly, Democrats and Republicans? Think about that. I handled the Recovery Act for our administration. $800 billion in 18 months with less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. We had an Inspector General who looked over everything I did and I met with once every two weeks. Got $145 billion out to state and localities so you didn’t have to lay off …\nVice President Joe Biden: (27:03)\n… billion dollars out to state and locality. So you didn’t have to lay off cops, firefighters, school teachers, nurses, first responders. What are we doing? Zip. The house acted, in the beginning of the summer, the so-called Heroes Act, to pay for all of this. States are in trouble. I’ll tell you why they’re not doing anything about it; two reasons. One, it’s all about wiping out the Affordable Care Act, which has been an obsession for this president since he became president. It was an Obama idea. Because no other nominee has said in the past that the law should be struck down. Not as a judge, [inaudible 00:00:27:59], that’s her view. That’s going to take health care coverage away from 20 million Americans. Because of his mishandling the economy and COVID, we’ve already lost 10 million people, have already lost their employer based health insurance, 10 million. That’s going to take away pre-existing conditions coverage for a hundred plus million Americans. And complications of COVID- 19 like lung scarring as well as heart damage, could well put how many millions more? There’s over 7 million people contracted COVID in the United States. What happens then? Pre-existing conditions can not be covered. It’s going to toss out the rule that allows children to be covered on their parents’ health care until age 26. It’s going to take us backwards. When insurance companies could charge a woman more for the same exact treatment that they charge a man. And pregnancy, once again, becomes a pre-existing condition. Folks, we can do so much better than this. Together we can build on the Affordable Care Act, writing a new health insurance option, a nonprofit public option, which is giving private insurers, a real competitor. Increase the subsidies, so premiums are lower and you can afford plans with lower deductibles, and lower out-of-pocket costs. We can only do any of this, if the country comes together.\nVice President Joe Biden: (29:47)\nLast week, I went to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to the battlefield where Abraham Lincoln told us that a house divided cannot stand. Today, trust is ebbing, hope seems elusive. Instead of trying to heal his policies are ripping us apart.\nVice President Joe Biden: (30:16)\nAnd those Republicans are willing to cooperate, get punished by this president. I refuse to let that happen. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. I know that sounds bizarre in light of where we are. The spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I said that from the time I announced, I was told that, “Maybe that the way things used to work, Joe, you got a lot done before Joe, but you can’t do that anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you and say we can, and we must, if we’re going to get anything done. Democracy requires consensus. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president.\nVice President Joe Biden: (31:11)\nThere will be no blue states and red states with me. It’s one America. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who vote against me, as those who voted for me. That’s the job of a president, the duty to care, to care for everybody. We can disagree on policy, but you can still care. And you too have a sacred duty, in my humble opinion. As my friend, John Lewis said before he died, and while he was alive, “You have a sacred obligation to vote.” It matters. Ohio matters. You elected me and Barack in 2008 and 12.\nVice President Joe Biden: (31:59)\nI’m asking for your support. I want to earn it, I’ll take nothing for granted. Asking for your support for Kamala and me in 2020. I promise we’ll always have your back. So please vote. Go to, I Will Vote.com/OH, now, to request your absentee ballot to vote by mail, to confirm your early voting location, to vote early in person, to find your polling place to vote in person on election day. Just make sure you have a plan.\nVice President Joe Biden: (32:39)\nAs a future congress woman said, “Bring along family, bring long friends, make their plans to vote as well.” No matter what, don’t let anybody discourage you and tell you your voice won’t be counted. It does. And don’t be intimidated by talk of having some of these Proud Boys stand there with their rifles in lines where you can open carry to try to intimidate people without saying anything. You, the American people decide our future; vote. And I’m convinced you’re going to turn out in large numbers.\nVice President Joe Biden: (33:22)\nWhen I announced, I said I was running to restore America’s soul. Well its time to restore it. So it’s time to rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class. This time, bring everybody along. No matter your race, your age, your gender, your religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability; everybody gets to come along. It’s time to unite America. And we’ll do that by choosing hope over fear, science over fiction, truth over lies, and unity over division. There’s nothing beyond the capacity of this nation when we stand together. So it’s time to stand up, take back our democracy, unite. And let’s, for the first time in a while, reflect the values that the vast majority of Americans hold. May God bless you. And may God bless our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

         "Joe Biden: (00:00)\nWell, I’ll tell you what. My dad was an automobile man. I got through school, and we got through being able to eat after he lost his job up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He had to move down to Delaware, because selling General Motors products. So I’ve known, and my state used to have the largest percentage of auto workers of any state in the nation, because we had a small population and the largest General Motors and largest Chrysler plant outside of Michigan and Ohio. I saw what happened when we got hit very hard. We’ve lost both those plants.\nJoe Biden: (00:47)\nWell, let me start off by saying, Mr. Mayor, thanks for the passport into your city, and Marcy, you’ve been a friend a long time. Thank you for your introduction. There’s no more fierce defender. There’s no more fierce defender, the people she grew up with, than Marcy. She has never, ever, ever forgotten where she came from. She’s tough. She’s a straight shooter. She’s influential in Congress. She’s honest, and she sees you. You’re always in her view.\nJoe Biden: (01:21)\nTony, Mr. President, I know you’re new, and he says, “Piece of cake.” So I don’t have to worry if I get elected the first 100 days. But all kidding aside, Tony, thank you for hosting us, and thank you, Local 14. [inaudible 00:26:09], thanks for that introduction. All you did for Barack and me when we were running, when we got elected, jumping in and being part of helping us govern, you remind me of something my dad said. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to say to your kid, look them in the eye and say, ‘Everything’s going to be okay’ and mean it. That’s what a job’s about, a decent paying job like the UAW provides.”\nJoe Biden: (02:13)\nThis lesson I grew up with, surrounded by hard work and families in Scranton and then in Claymont, Delaware, where we had to move when Dad lost work. There was no work in Scranton, just like here in Toledo, but the times are hard. Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic and the terrible way in which it’s been handled. The economic outlook remains uncertain. Across Ohio and the country, folks are worried about making their next mortgage payment or their rent payment, whether or not they can purchase their prescription drugs or be able to put food on the table, literally worried about whether their kids’ schools open and be able to stay open and, if they’re not open, how they can go to work, if they have a job, and still take care of their kids.\nJoe Biden: (03:03)\nThey see the people at the very top doing better than they ever have while they’re left to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me?” That’s Donald Trump’s presidency, 215,000 dead because of COVID. Experts say we’re likely to lose another 200,000 people in the next few months unless we take some serious action. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, all because this president’s only worried about one thing: the stock market. They refuse to follow the science. It’s estimated that if we just wore these masks nationally, we’d save over 100,000 lives between now and the end of the year.\nJoe Biden: (03:46)\nThis president knew back in January. He was briefed in detail by the intelligence community how extremely dangerous this COVID virus was, how communicable the disease was. He went on a taped interview with Bob Woodward, a leading journalist. It’s on tape. It’s been played, telling Woodward that he knew how dangerous the disease was, but did nothing. Ask yourself, “Why didn’t he tell us? Why didn’t he warn us?” He said nothing. He told Woodward he didn’t want it panic the American people. That’s why he said nothing.\nJoe Biden: (04:24)\nWe don’t panic. America doesn’t panic. But Trump panicked. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is President, the more reckless he seems to get. Dr. Fauci, the most respected doc on this issue in the world, in the country, he told the president … You know the president’s announcement of his pick for the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden? He’s referred to that as a super spreader. All those people got the disease.\nJoe Biden: (05:00)\nHow’s he responding? Well, guess what? He’s now running an ad you probably saw, a national ad quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Way back in March, referring to public health officials, Dr. Fauci said, “I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more,” end of quote. In the recent ad that’s going out nationally, Trump quotes Dr. Fauci is saying that about him, the president. Trump and his campaign deliberately lied, making it sound like Fauci was talking about Trump. Fauci went on to the public air when the ad came out saying, three days ago, “I did not get permission for that quote.” He wasn’t referring to the president.\nJoe Biden: (05:47)\nEven after that, Fauci said he didn’t say that. The president and the campaign, even after Fauci laid this out, the campaign said, “We’re still going to use it, because he did say it, even though it wasn’t about him.” The point I’m trying to make is it was a knowing lie, like we’re being told about everything about this COVID consequences. As a consequence, through his months of overwhelming lying, misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs were around your breakfast table this morning? Someone you love, somebody you cared about, someone you knew, a family member or a neighbor, missing, missing. Why? Because of negligence.\nJoe Biden: (06:36)\nLook, I view this campaign, as I’ve said before and I’ll say it again, between Scranton and Park Avenue, between Toledo and Park Avenue. All Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street. That’s why his only metric for American prosperity that he values is the Dow Jones and the index. Like a lot of you, I spent a lot of my time with guys like Trump looking down on me, the Irish Catholic kid in the neighborhood, guys who thought they were better than me because they had a lot of money, guys who inherited everything they ever got and still managed to squander it.\nJoe Biden: (07:18)\nI have to admit I shouldn’t have done it, but I’ve on record saying, and so I’ll repeat it, I still have a little bit of a chip on my shoulder about guys like him. I read some stories after I got the nomination that quote, “If Biden gets elected, he’ll be the first non-Ivy League school graduate to get elected in” … [inaudible 00:07:42] it was 80 or 90 years. Guys, have a seat, man. You know what? Like some state school guy who went to the University of Delaware, I was proud of it. Hard to get there, hard to get through in terms of money. But folks, since when can someone who went to a state university not be qualified to be President?\nJoe Biden: (08:03)\nFolks, I know what it takes to be President. I sat next to a man for eight years, watching and participating. My mom taught me what you’re probably taught by your parents, too. She said, “Joey, nobody is better than you, but everybody’s your equal.”\nJoe Biden: (08:25)\nI don’t measure people based on the size of their bank account. I don’t respect people based on whether they own a mansion. I don’t judge them based on whether they belong to a country club. You and I measure people by the strength of their character, their honesty, their courage, their courage. My mom used to say, “The greatest gift of all, the greatest virtue is courage. You’re redeemed by your courage.” That’s what she’d say, and redeemed by your loyalty, honesty, loyalty, things that are bigger than yourself or the neighborhoods we were raised in.\nJoe Biden: (09:04)\nIt’s all about family, decency, honor, opportunity. These are the values I learned growing up in Scranton, my guess is you learn growing up in Toledo, wherever you grew up. The people I grew up with in Scranton didn’t have any money in stocks. In our house, growing up, every penny my dad made went to paying the bills, keeping the lights on and food on the table. Every penny our friends in Scranton made went to paying the bills and taking care of their families as well. We looked out for our neighbors.\nJoe Biden: (09:35)\nThat’s why I have a different measure by which I judge the health of America’s economy. I see hardworking women and men who are just trying to earn an honest living and take care of their families, just want an even shot. They’re not asking for anything. They’re just asking for a fair shot, and given a shot, the American people will never, ever, ever, ever let their country down, never.\nJoe Biden: (10:02)\nThe other expression my dad would have, he’d say, “When you see the abuse of power, there’s only one way to respond to it, and that’s with power.” The only power we have to take on corporate America is union power. That’s the only power. I just think back to 2008, when Barack and I were elected and we inherited the worst recession short of a depression in history. The president put me in charge of the Recovery Act, $800 billion. It was needed to save our economy from going into depression. We did it with less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. We were able to see to it that Ohio and other states received substantial assistance to address their economic pain and recover and rebuild, to make sure we kept teachers, firefighters, and cops, public nurses on the job. People are being laid off now because you don’t have the local money to do it.\nJoe Biden: (11:01)\nSo they didn’t have to be fired because of lack of money. That was the federal government stepped up, and it started the longest sustained economic recovery in American history that this guy inherited and then squandered again. But you know what Mitch McConnell said recently about helping the states and cities. He said, quote, “Let them go bankrupt.” Well, I heard that before. You heard it, too. Republicans said the same thing about the automobile industry.\nJoe Biden: (11:32)\nLike I said, I come from an automobile state, an automobile man. The auto industry that supported one in eight Ohioans was on the brink. It was more than ten years ago, but you remember like it was yesterday. It was on the brink. But Barack and I bet on you and the American worker, and it paid off. I argued the American worker was the finest auto worker in the world. Management screwed it up. You didn’t. You didn’t make the mistake. By the way, it all got paid back. But guess who made the greatest sacrifices? Auto workers. You made the sacrifices to get it back.\nJoe Biden: (12:15)\nSo it’s over the many objections of many that we stepped in and rescued the automobile industry, General Motors and Chrysler, saving one million jobs. Then what happened when Donald Trump came to office? Remember what Trump said in 2017 in Lordstown? He said, “Don’t move,” quote, “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house.” But Lordstown shut down on Trump’s watch.\nJoe Biden: (12:43)\nAfter a decade in Cleveland, after the debate in Cleveland, I met with an elementary school teacher in Lordstown. Her husband was there as well, one of the workers who lost his job in Lordstown. He had to accept a transfer to a plan in Kentucky, eight hours away, one way, to maintain his healthcare and his pension. He drives 16 hours a weekend to see her and their two kids.\nJoe Biden: (13:10)\nBut Donald Trump’s betrayal doesn’t stop there. He betrayed union workers at Goodyear when he called for a boycott of buying Goodyear tires because of a personal grudge. He passed a tax bill for the super wealthy corporations that actually provided incentives for companies to move jobs overseas.\nJoe Biden: (13:33)\nFolks, manufacturing is the backbone of America. But we’re in a manufacturing recession because of Donald Trump even before the COVID virus hit. We’re down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started, and our balance of payments, meaning we’re sending more overseas than coming to us. I mean, we’re buying more overseas than we’re selling, is higher than it’s been a long time. There’s still 10,900 lost auto worker manufacturing jobs in Ohio that did not come back. The Trump presidency will be the first presidency since Herbert Hoover over 90 years ago, first president of modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he came to office.\nJoe Biden: (14:25)\nDonald Trump’s only plan is more tax cuts for the wealthy. Most of you, if you still have a job, paid more than he paid last year in taxes. $750? Come on. The system’s rigged. We’ve got to change it. $30 billion, a new proposal, just for the gains of the 100 richest billionaires in America, 30 billion. Hear me? They made $30 billion alone in this year, while the rest of the people were getting killed.\nJoe Biden: (15:04)\nIn the middle of this pandemic, why do Republicans have time to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court instead of providing the significant economic need for localities? I’ll tell you why. It’s about finally getting his wish to wipe out the Affordable Healthcare Act, because their nominee has said in the past that the law should be struck down. His relentless effort to eliminate the Affordable Care Act that provided healthcare coverage for 20 million people who didn’t have it, protections for well over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. We’ve seen his pledge, quote, “to terminate the tax dedicated to financing Social Security.”\nJoe Biden: (15:53)\nMarcy and I were talking about that. You know what the actuary at the Social Security Department said? If it goes through, this tax, he’s talking about, cut on Social Security, it will actually bankrupt, bankrupt Social Security by the middle of 2023. Go home and tell your parents that.\nJoe Biden: (16:14)\nNot once has President Trump called for a high-level meeting between Democrats and Republicans in the White House. This is going on now. The House already passed back in the beginning of the summer this [inaudible 00:16:29] to be able to reconcile people in real trouble, get help to states like we did. He had once called a meeting between Democrats and Republicans to deliver the new COVID relief package for working families and small businesses that are going bankrupt. He spent too much time and the bunker of his golf course or in the bunker of the White House than he was willing to actually sit to try to work something out.\nJoe Biden: (17:00)\nCheck it out. First president I can ever remember, in the middle of a national economic crisis, did not try to call the parties together. He turned his back on you. I promise you I will never do that.\nJoe Biden: (17:19)\nFolks, that’s why my Build Back Better plan is built around a simple concept. It’s time to reward work, not wealth, work. I mean it. An independent analysis by a big Wall Street firm called Moody’s, not a Democratic think tank, they did an analysis of my economic plan to revive this country and an analysis of his. Here’s what they concluded: that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs in the next four years, 7 million, more than the president’s economic plan. It would generate economic growth, an additional trillion dollars more than the president’s plan. Look, what these guys don’t get is when you do well, when my family does well, everybody does better. Everybody does better. That’s the God’s truth.\nJoe Biden: (18:28)\nHere’s how my plan works. I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. If you make more than 400, beep your horn, because you’re going to get a tax raise. Well, I’m going to raise your tax slightly if you’re making over 400. But look, you’re not going to pay a penny more. In fact, tens of millions of middle class families are going to get a tax cut when they need it most for raising their kids, trying to get affordable healthcare, buying their first home, or saving for retirement.\nJoe Biden: (18:58)\nBut I’m going to ask big corporations and the super wealthy just to begin to start to pay their fair share. I’m going to raise back tax cut he gave for corporate America. They were paying the mid thirties. They’re now paying 21. If we just raise the tax back to what it should be, 28%, that generates over $100 billion. Hear me? That’s money. I mean, excuse me, $1.3 trillion. That’s what it raises to help hardworking folks, to allow us to invest in work and people and grow the middle class and make sure everybody comes along this time. My plan will create a million good-paying union jobs, manufacturing and building products and technology that we need now and in the future. We’re not investing in research.\nJoe Biden: (19:51)\nIt starts with a pretty basic idea. The federal government every year spent $600 billion just making sure that we have ships and planes, cars, trains, all the things the government lets contracts for. Well, I promise you this. Every single product, every single contract let will be only let to a company or a firm that makes it in America from beginning to end. Not a joke. It’s going to be used to buy American products, support American jobs. We’ll invest to build more resilient infrastructure, roads, bridges, ports, 1.5 million new affordable housing units, high-speed broadband in every American household, more important than ever. We’re going to rebuild crumbling schools, retrofit four million buildings, and weatherize two million homes, creating one million new jobs, the reason why everyone from the electrical works and every other major union is strongly supporting us. It’s all going to be done by certified union labor. Promise.\nJoe Biden: (21:11)\nYou may remember when the president put me in charge of that $800 billion, not one single contract went out that wasn’t prevailing wage, not one. So we’re going to end Trump’s new incentive for sending jobs abroad. That’s what he’s done. More jobs are going abroad now. Any company that offshores a job is going to pay a 10% penalty. Any company that brings back a job, reopens a closed factory, like a manufacturing plant, they’ll get a 10% credit for their investment. We’re going to make trade strategy that fights for every American worker and every American job and actually get results, not Trump’s chaotic trade war, erratic tweets, and bluster that’s only stiffed American workers and consumers, including farmers. He’s let you down. He’s let us down.\nJoe Biden: (22:13)\nI promise you I will stand up to China’s trade abuses, and I will invest in the American worker, because I know no one, nobody can outcompete an American worker when they’ve gotten a fair shot, nobody in the world.\nJoe Biden: (22:29)\nOne more thing: The United States government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. We’re going to convert many of them to electric vehicles, and you’re going to still need to build these transmissions for a long time to come. But any new jobs in that area are going to go to people who are in the automobile industry, who are in the manufacturing, who are in the UAW are going to be making these new vehicles, sourced right here in America. The government will provide and demand support to retool factories that are struggling to compete. The US auto industry will step up. I’ll expand capacity so the United States, not China leads the world in modern new technology.\nJoe Biden: (23:14)\nWe’re going to make it easier for American consumers to move to the vehicles of the future by building a network of 500,000 charging stations across the country. We’re offering consumers rebates to swap older fuel-efficient cars. We’re going to move in a direction that technology is taking us and making sure UAW leads the way in how we do it. Together, this will mean one million good new jobs in the auto industry.\nJoe Biden: (23:51)\nFolks, it’s an example of how we can do anything. I’m more optimistic about what we have a chance to do in the next four to six years, eight years, than anything anytime in my whole career. The blinders have been taken off the American people. They see what the combination of the pandemic, the economic crisis, the racial inequality refacing, and what’s going on internationally, and they’re ready to step up. They know we have to change.\nJoe Biden: (24:27)\nNothing, nothing, nothing is beyond the capacity of the United States of America, and I mean that. Think about it. We’re the only country in the world that’s come out of every crisis stronger than we went in because of who we are. As I’ve said to other world leaders, never underestimate the American people. There’s no quit in America. There’s none. In America, we can do anything that we need to do if we can do it together. Nothing can stop us.\nJoe Biden: (25:05)\nWe have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I ran as a proud Democrat for the Senate. I had run as a proud Democrat for Vice President, and I’m running as a proud Democrat for President. But I promise you this. I will govern as an American president. I’ll govern for every one who voted for me, as well as against me. We can be better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. So vote. Vote. Visit iwill.com/ohio. God bless you. God bless the auto workers. God protect. Thank you. Which way am I going?",

         "Vice President Mike Pence: (00:28)\nHello Ohio. The Lieutenant Governor Husted, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, my friend, Congressman Troy Balderson, the state Republican Chairman Jane Timken, all my fellow Americans near and far. It is great to be back in the Buckeye State. Happy Columbus Day. And it’s also great to be here with a family business that’s created near their 400 good paying Ohio jobs. Would you join me in thanking Marty Savko, Senior, Marty Savko, Jr., and all the great men and women of Savko & Sons. What a great family. And I appreciate y’all coming out today. But I’m here for one reason and one reason only, and that is that Ohio and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. It’s on Ohio and the road to victory runs right through the Buckeye State.\nVice President Mike Pence: (01:49)\nReally is great to be with all of you. I had a busy week last week. I don’t know if you got to see it, but I had a little debate with Kamala Harris over in Salt Lake city. Some people think we did all right, but let me be clear with all of you. Let me be clear with all of you. That debate was not just a debate between two candidates for vice president. It was a debate between two visions. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine. They want to abolish fossil fuels. They want taxpayer funding of abortion, defund the police and pack the Supreme Court. Don’t you doubt it.\nVice President Mike Pence: (02:39)\nPresident Trump’s vision, we rebuild our military. We cut taxes. We roll back regulations. We unleashed American energy. We secured our border, supported law enforcement, stood for life and liberty and the Constitution of the United States.\nSpeaker 1: (03:02)\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (03:17)\nAnd everything we’d done, obviously, got them a little bit worked up. But I got to tell you, when the people of Ohio compare the Biden Harris agenda with our agenda, the choice is clear. If you cherish faith and freedom, law and order and life in 22 days, we need you to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. It’s true.\nVice President Mike Pence: (03:51)\nFour years ago, we inherited a military that’s been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression.\nSpeaker 1: (04:06)\nUSA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.\nSpeaker 1: (04:06)\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (05:16)\nBoy, is it good to be back in the Heartland? I’m telling you what. I grew up just right next door. I tell people I come from a place with people with strong hearts and strong opinions. But this is a country that loves the proud heritage, past, present and future of the good old USA.\nVice President Mike Pence: (05:50)\nNow, like I started to say, four years ago, we inherited a military that was hollowed out by reckless budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression, terrorism was on the rise around the world, and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values.\nVice President Mike Pence: (06:13)\nBut in three short years, we rebuild our military, we restored the arsenal of democracy, and as your vice-president and the proud father of a United States Marine, I’m happy to report, we’re finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support that they need to defend this nation.\nVice President Mike Pence: (06:38)\nI mean, did you know when we took office… when we took office, there was a large number of aircraft in the Air Force that were kept on the ground to be used as spare parts, to keep other aircraft in the air. But thanks to President Donald Trump, those days are over. President Trump has signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We’ve stood with those who serve and their families. And we’ve stood with all of you who wore the uniform of the United States of America.\nVice President Mike Pence: (07:18)\nWhen Joe Biden was Vice President, America saw years of heartbreaking scandal at the VA that shocked the conscience of the nation. I mean, here in this city that’s home to more than 100,000 veterans and you all live through it like we did. I mean, there were actually veterans who perished waiting to receive basic care at VA facilities. But under President Donald Trump, and I’m proud to report, we’ve signed the most sweeping reforms of the VA in 50 years. We fired thousands of VA employees that weren’t providing the care our veterans earned. And now Veterans Choice is now available to every veteran in America.\nVice President Mike Pence: (08:10)\nIn fact, if you’re able to stand, please do, otherwise raise your hand. If you wore the uniform of the United States, would you just put your hand in the air and give us a chance to thank you one more time for your service to America. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service. God bless you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: (08:40)\nUSA. USA. USA. USA.\nVice President Mike Pence: (08:40)\nGreat Americans.\nSpeaker 1: (08:40)\nUSA. USA. USA.\nVice President Mike Pence: (08:40)\nWe didn’t just rebuild our military and support our veterans. In our first three years, we revived the American economy. Where Joe Biden wants to raise taxes, President Trump cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses just like this one. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history. We unleashed American energy. We fought for free and fair trade. And it just three short years, businesses large and small created more than 7 million good paying jobs, including 97,000 jobs right here in the Buckeye State.\nVice President Mike Pence: (09:16)\nAnd a good example’s right here at Savko & Sons. I was talking to the family on my way in. They told me after President Trump’s tax cuts, the Savko’s bought 70 new pieces of equipment and trucks. Some of them are right around us here. More importantly, they told me they gave their employees substantial pay raises and Savko & Sons doubled in size and they are hiring today. What a great family and a great company.\nVice President Mike Pence: (10:03)\nIt’s amazing to think this company started like so many other great American companies began, with Marty’s dad, his mom, and a wheelbarrow. He was an Army veteran, had just come back from World War II, the son of an immigrant, coal miner, who literally walked to Columbus from the mines of Western Pennsylvania. Nick Savko built everything that matters, a family, a business and a good name. He lived the American dream.\nVice President Mike Pence: (10:35)\nBut today we’re joined by a woman without whom none of that would have been possible. She’s the daughter of an Italian immigrant. She helped lead this company for decades, the former Democrat, who’s now supporting President Donald Trump, 97 years young. Would you join me in welcoming, Gilda Savko, the matriarch of Savko & Sons. Thank you, Gilda. Thank you, Gilda. I walked up and Gilda said, “I’ve been praying for you.” And I said, “Well, that explains a lot.” Thank you, Gilda. Thank you for you and your example in your family. We’re so inspired.\nVice President Mike Pence: (11:25)\nWe’ve stood for our national defense, for our veterans and for jobs and opportunities, businesses just like this one. And President Donald Trump has stood every day for the rule of law. We’ve appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level and they are all men and women who will uphold all the God-given liberties in our constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms. Now, last month we rightly-\nVice President Mike Pence: (12:03)\nNow last month we rightly paused as a nation to honor the life and service of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But when the memorials were over, President Donald Trump fulfilled his duty under the Constitution, and he nominated an extraordinary, principled, conservative woman to the Supreme Court of the United States, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Now the Senate started their confirmation hearings this morning, all the senators were doing their opening remarks. The questioning will probably start tomorrow and the president said, “Democrats on the judiciary committee need to give Judge Barrett a respectful and dignified hearing this time.” But we have reason to be concerned. You all remember the attacks on Judge Barrett’s faith, when she was confirmed to the Court of Appeals just two years ago. Democrats and their Hollywood friends have already started to attack Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Christian faith as well, this time around.\nVice President Mike Pence: (13:16)\nBack then one Democrat questioned her qualifications because he called her quote, “An Orthodox Catholic.” Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris actually attacked another one of our nominees to the federal courts because he was a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. And the ranking Democrat on the judiciary committee says, “Judge Barrett’s Catholic faith was of concern.” And said, quote, “The dogma lives loudly within you.” Well, I got news for the Democrats and their friends in Hollywood. That dogma lives loudly in me. That dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of our faith and conscience lives in the Constitution of the United States of America.\nVice President Mike Pence: (14:23)\nThese attacks on religious faith must stop and they must stop now. Now the Senate has a job to do and after they discharged their duty to advise and consent, I’ll make a prediction. Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be Justice Amy Coney Barrett. We’re going to fill that seat.\nVice President Mike Pence: (14:56)\nSpeaking of the Supreme Court, the American people also deserve to know that Democrats are actually talking about adding seats to the Supreme Court. It’s called packing the court, if they win this election. It would be nothing less than the biggest power grab in American history. They want to pack the court with liberal judges. They want to tear down more than a century and a half of judicial independence in this country. After 150 years with nine seats on the Supreme Court of the United States, Democrats in Washington are talking about packing the court. And Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won’t tell the American people what they’re going to do. Joe Biden refused to answer the question during the presidential debate.\nVice President Mike Pence: (15:47)\nYou might’ve seen Kamala Harris refuse to answer the question that when I posed it to her during the vice presidential debate. And last Friday, Joe Biden was asked if voters deserve to know if he plans to pack the court? And Joe Biden said, quote, “No, they don’t.” Well Joe, yes, they do. The American people deserve a straight answer and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris need to come clean with the American people and come clean right now. When you’re running for the highest court in the land, the American people deserve to know whether you’re going to respect the highest court in the land. The truth is there’s only one explanation why they won’t answer the question, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to pack the Supreme Court, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to re-elect President Donald Trump for four more years in the White House. And we’re going to preserve an independent judiciary for generations to come.\nVice President Mike Pence: (17:01)\nSo we’ve stood for the rule of law and an independent judiciary. And every single day, President Donald Trump has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will. Let’s hear it for all those in law enforcement who are with us here today.\nVice President Mike Pence: (17:26)\nI like to say all my heroes wear uniforms, whether it’s those you who wore the uniform of the United States or those of you who put on the uniform of law enforcement. I have to tell you, since I was a little boy, we’d go up to we’d visit my grandparents and we were there with my uncle who was a Chicago police officer for 25 years. He’d come out in the morning, dressed in that uniform, sidearm strapped to his belt. Me and my three brothers would just looked at him in awe. I think you all know, the men and women who serve in law enforcement in this country are the best people in America. And they deserve the respect of every American every day. Thank you for your service.\nVice President Mike Pence: (18:39)\nNow, President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech, violence against innocent civilians, the destruction of property or violence against law enforcement will not be tolerated. And those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Now for months all Joe Biden talked about was peaceful protestors, remember? All summer long. As the American people literally watch businesses in their communities burn to the ground.\nVice President Mike Pence: (19:24)\nI was in Minneapolis, not long ago. I traveled with Flora Westbrook. A wonderful African-American business owner who told me of that night, just a few days after the killing of George Floyd. That she watched violent protesters come closer and closer and closer to her business. A business that she built a little salon, 35 years ago and they burned her out. And I stood alongside what remains of her business, just a few short weeks ago. And I told flora from the heart of this president and the heart of the American people, we’re going to rebuild that business. We’re going to rebuild that community bigger and better than ever before.\nVice President Mike Pence: (20:17)\nFlora, and all those like her who’ve been victimized by these violent protestors and rioters deserve nothing less. But the truth is Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence in our cities. I mean, when you start to withdraw support for those who protect and serve, you only emboldened those who would do harm to our communities and our families.\nVice President Mike Pence: (20:44)\nNow, Joe Biden explains it all by saying that America is in his words, systemically racist. And that police as he said, and his running mate said last week. That police have a quote, ” Implicit bias against minorities.” When Joe Biden was asked if he’d support cutting funding of law enforcement, he said, “Yes, absolutely.” Let me make your promise. Under President Donald Trump, we’re going to back the blue. We’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. Under President Donald Trump, we’re going to have law and order in every city, in every state for every American of every race and creed and color. So help us God. The president and I know what you know, we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors and families. We have done both for the last three and a half years, and we’re going to keep supporting law enforcement and keep expanding opportunities and jobs and education for African-Americans and all of our minorities for four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (22:27)\nSo we’ve stood for the rule of law, for law and order and all the values that have made this country great. And I can’t tell you how proud I am to be vice-president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. Where Joe Biden supports taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history.\nVice President Mike Pence: (23:15)\nSo we’ve rebuilt our military, revived our economy, stood for law and order, liberties in life. In three short years, we made America great again. And none of that would have been possible without the strong support of our allies in Congress. That’s why we need to send Congressman Troy Balderson back to a new Republican majority that retires Nancy Pelosi once and for all.\nVice President Mike Pence: (24:04)\nWhat a great guy and what a great, great champion of this administration. Thank you, Congressman Balderson. So we made great progress in our first three years, and then the coronavirus struck from China. But I’m here to tell you, when there were just five cases of the coronavirus in the United States, President Trump did what no other American president had ever done, he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Joe Biden said that was “hysterical, xenophobic.” He actually wrote in the month of January that banning travel “would make things worse.” But I can tell you, as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, President Donald Trump’s action, suspending travel from China, saved untold American lives and it bought us time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. It’s true.\nVice President Mike Pence: (25:12)\nWe reinvented testing. We saw to the factoring delivery of hundreds of millions of medical supplies to our incredible doctors and nurses. We developed medicines that are literally saving lives and we are on track to have the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year, it’s going to happen. As the President said on the South Lawn on Friday, through the power of American science and medicine, we will eradicate the China virus once and for all. I spoke to the President this morning and I’m happy to report to all of you here in the Buckeye State, the President and the First Lady are doing great and he is back on the road today. But let me take this opportunity on behalf of the President to say how move we’ve all been by the outpouring of prayers concern for the first family. I know how much it’s meant to them. But he and I both believe it’s really just a reflection of the outpouring of concern and prayers, and care that the American people have shown to all of our neighbors throughout this pandemic.\nVice President Mike Pence: (26:33)\nSo can we just take a moment to show our appreciation for the doctors, the nurses, the first responders, those in ministry, all those that have come alongside our families who have suffered loss and struggled with this pandemic, we are so grateful to you all. Thank you so much. So every day we’re one day closer to that day we put the coronavirus in the past with a vaccine and medicines. But in the meantime, I promise you we’ll keep protecting the vulnerable. Keep making sure our healthcare workers have all the supplies they need. We’ll keep saving lives. And were Joe Biden is talking about shutting down the economy, President Donald Trump, he’s opening up America again. I mean, after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, I’m proud to report to you that we’ve already seen 11 and a half million Americans go back to work, including more than 400,000 people right here in the state of Ohio.\nVice President Mike Pence: (27:57)\nWe’re not just opening up America, we’re opening up America’s schools. We just announced about two weeks ago that we’re sending a hundred million rapid tests for the coronavirus to every school system, every school nurse in America. So our kids can get back in the classroom and stay back in the classroom safe and sound. The schools are opening and thanks to President Donald Trump in just two short weeks, it’s going to be, O-H-\nAudience: (28:32)\nI-O!\nVice President Mike Pence: (28:33)\nBuckeye football is coming back. How good is that? In fact, I just heard that the quarterback who won the national championship back in 2014 is actually with us today. Cardale Jones, where are you? Let’s hear it for Cardale Jones. O-H-\nAudience: (29:06)\nI-O!\nVice President Mike Pence: (29:12)\nI’ll tell you what, it’s a little tough for this Hoosier to cheer for Ohio State, but I know how excited you all are, we are too. So we’ve gone through a time of testing. You all are here today because three weeks from tomorrow, we’re coming to a time for choosing. The choice in this election has never been clearer, the stakes have never been higher. It’s amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars. President Trump, we not only cut taxes across the board in our first four years, we’re going to keep cutting middle class taxes for four more years. Joe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of regulation. He had to be reminded in that presidential debate that he supports the Green New Deal. He wants to put us back in that Paris Climate Accord. President Trump, he unleashed American energy. We’ve stood with coal miners in Eastern Ohio and now America’s a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. Joe Biden’s for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and free healthcare for illegal immigrants. President Trump, he’s made record investments in border security. We’ve already built more than 300 miles of that border wall on the Southern border of the United States. And with four more years, we’re going to fix this broken immigration system once and for all. And when it comes to jobs and trade, contrast is clearer still. Here in the Heartland, I don’t have to tell any of you about the impact of NAFTA over the last 25 years. Over in the Hoosier state, we literally saw entire communities shuttered, jobs shipped south of the border. 60,000 factories closed in the 25 years after NAFTA was signed into law. And Joe Biden never lifted a finger to reform it or renegotiate it. But thanks to the man who wrote the Art of the Deal, Ohio got a better deal. NAFTA is gone and the U.S.M.C.A. is here to stay. It’s a win for Ohio and a win for America.\nVice President Mike Pence: (31:56)\nAnd for decades, for decades we saw America losing out to China in international trade. When we came into office, half of our international trade deficit was with communist China, $500 billion a year lost to that one country. Joe Biden’s been a cheerleader for communist China all along the way. He actually said that the rise of China was a positive development for America. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all the tariffs that President Trump has put into effect to hold China accountable and level the playing field for American workers. President Trump, he put China on notice on day one and the era of economic surrender is over. We’re going to stand strong until China opens their markets to U.S. goods and respects the intellectual property rights of American businesses.\nAudience: (33:04)\nUSA! USA! USA!\nVice President Mike Pence: (33:06)\nSo we’ve stood strong for security, prosperity, free market principles, and putting America first. And as President Trump said at Mount Rushmore, we’ve also stood against those who would, in his words, wipe out our history, defame our heroes, and erase our values. But the truth is Joe Biden and today’s Democratic Party have been giving in to the most radical voices in this country. Voices that want to cancel our culture and erase our history. On this Columbus Day, we should remember that day earlier this year when radicals toppled the Christopher Columbus statue in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. Beheaded the statue of the great explorer in Boston. And here in Columbus, Ohio, last summer in the dead of night, your Democrat mayor took down the statue of Christopher Columbus outside city hall.\nAudience: (34:07)\nBoo!\nVice President Mike Pence: (34:12)\nAnd he did that despite the fact that proud Italian-American families like the [inaudible 00:34:17] family actually paid to import that stature from Italy 65 years ago. And folks it’s still going on. I don’t know if you saw on the news this morning but last night, violent protesters in Portland tore down statues of Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. The truth is, as the President has said, today the radical left is determined to tear down every statute, symbol and memory of our national heritage. But the American people are strong and proud. We will not allow our country and all its history and culture to be taken away from us. That’s one more reason why we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\nAudience: (35:06)\nFour more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nVice President Mike Pence: (35:28)\nWhen you look at their agenda, tearing down our economy, tearing down our institutions, tearing down our history. It’s clear, Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. Now, Joe Biden has said that democracy is on the ballot. Well, I think our economic recovery is on the ballot. Law and order are on the ballot. But there are also things far more foundational to our country that are on the ballot as well. In this election-\nVice President Mike Pence: (36:03)\n[inaudible 00:36:00]. In this election, I think it’s not going to be whether America will end up more conservative or more liberal, more red or more blue, more Republican or more Democrat. I think the choice in this election is whether America remains America. Whether we’re going to allow Joe Biden and the Democratic Party to steer our nation on a leftward path toward more government, less freedom, and abandonment of our most cherished ideals in history, or whether we’re going to reaffirm our commitment to everything that’s always made America great.\nVice President Mike Pence: (36:48)\nSo, I want to say to each and every one of you here, three weeks and one day away from election, for our freedom and all the ideals that have made this nation exceptional and great, we need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be president of United States of America. We’re going to re-elect President Donald Trump for four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (37:25)\nIt’s on, Ohio. It’s going to take all of us. Ohio always looms large in presidential elections all throughout our history, and that’s just as true today. So, we need you to tell your neighbors and friends. Just say, “Hey, I was over at Savko & Sons the other day. I ran into Mike, and he was telling me we need four more years.” And if they say to you, “What’s that mean?” Say, “Well, four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means more support for our troops and our police.” And you tell them I said it’s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp.\nVice President Mike Pence: (38:19)\nOh, we’re draining it. Four years ago, a movement was born. The movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. Here in Ohio, you believe we could be strong again. You believe we could be prosperous again. You believe America could be proud again, stand tall in the world again. You said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016, and I know the Buckeye State’s going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020.\nVice President Mike Pence: (39:00)\nI’ve really only known this president for about four years. We’d met each other a couple of times along the way, but when I met him, before he asked me to join this ticket I sensed what you did four years ago. I sensed a vision, a belief in America, a belief in the American people, and the leadership qualities to make it happen. I joined that ticket in a heartbeat.\nVice President Mike Pence: (39:24)\nSome people think we’re kind of different.\nSpeaker 2: (39:26)\nYou’re not different.\nVice President Mike Pence: (39:31)\nBut I got to tell you’ve gotten be to very close friends, and it’s the greatest honor in my life to be vice president to President Donald Trump. It is, and I thank you for the honor. But I want to tell you something, I’ve seen it firsthand, I’ve been at his side every day for the last three and a half years, and I’ll make you a promise. Even when the cameras are off and nobody’s around there’s not a day gone by that President Donald Trump hasn’t gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of Ohio. Now it’s our turn to fight for him. It’s on, Ohio. We got to bring it. We got to bring it.\nVice President Mike Pence: (40:22)\nSo, keep bringing all this enthusiasm. Keep voicing your support. Talk about all that we’ve accomplished all across the Buckeye State and all across America. Let me give you a couple of tasks. Number one, vote, Ohio. Vote to re-elect President Donald Trump. I actually heard that early starting already started here. Early voting. In fact, I checked on my way here, you can actually leave from here and go to the Franklin County Board of Elections at 1700 Morse Road. They’re open until 5:00 today. Go and vote to re-elect President Donald Trump, and remember, friends don’t let friends vote alone. Bring a friend. Get it done. Get it done early. Then we need you to go to work. You need to reach out to your neighbors and friends and tell them what’s at stake in this election. Volunteer your time. Make some phone calls. Knock on a few doors. Do everything you can. Finally, if you’re of a mind of bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, in the next three weeks and one day I’d encourage you to do that too.\nVice President Mike Pence: (41:54)\nIn all of my travels over the last four years, I’m convinced of two things. America is a freedom-loving nation and America is a nation of faith. It truly is. And so, in these challenging times where that little girl that asked the question at the end of the vice-presidential debate, where you turn on the television and it seems like there’s more that divides us than unites us in this country, I’ll always believe that there’s a wellspring of support that unites us in America far beyond anything that could divide us, and that’s the faith of the American people. So, in the days between now and election day, I’d encourage you to pray. And on this one, I just encourage you to pray for all of the American people.\nVice President Mike Pence: (43:03)\nIn these challenging times, global pandemic, times of division and dissension in our nation, I still believe that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray, in turn, that he’ll do like he’s always done through the long and storied history of this nation. He’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land. This one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So, pray for America. Pray for all the American people. It’ll make a difference.\nVice President Mike Pence: (43:54)\nAnd I’m absolutely convinced when you get out and vote and bring your neighbors, and friends, and family to the polls between now and election day, when you get out and tell that story that with your continued support and prayers every day between now and November 3rd, we’re going to make Ohio and America more prosperous than ever before. We’re going to make Ohio and America safer than ever before. And with Troy Balderson and a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives, with a re-elected Republican majority in the United States Senate, with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years and with God’s help, we’re going to make America great again. Again.\nVice President Mike Pence: (44:55)\nThank you all very much. God bless you. God bless, America. Let’s go get it done.",

         "Joe Biden: (00:03)\nHello, hello, hello, hello. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It’s good to be back in Erie. I want to say hello to all of Erie. But mainly Mr.Mayor, City Council President Horton, and all local elected leaders who are joining us here today. And to your next Senator, Julie. We need to turn out and support for Democrats down the line here in Pennsylvania and win back that Pennsylvania state Senate. Folks, look. I want to thank you President McManus for coming out, you’ve been a good friend a long time. And for everyone at the UA for hosting this incredible training facility. I’m so grateful to have earned UA’s endorsement. You have over 355 proud plumbers, pipe fitters, and more behind me then I can possibly thank you for.\nJoe Biden: (00:58)\nAlso, want to thank Rick for sharing his story with us today. And for being part of a conversation this year where he shared a story with America. And Rick, Delaware is thought of as being a great corporate entity, and chemical facilities, and all those things. But we have a $4 billion, as you probably well know, agricultural industry in the Delmarva Peninsula. It’s a big deal and a lot of farmers are being hurt really badly, really badly. Farmers all across the country have been gutted by the president’s broken promises and reckless trade war. But our farmers, just like our union members and anyone who actually does an honest day’s work, see him and his promises for what they are. Rick, I want to thank you. And I think you put it best in the op-ed you wrote last year. You said, “It’s a bunch of hot air and cold wind.”\nJoe Biden: (01:55)\nFolks, this is it. Election’s here. The choice couldn’t be more stark. The stakes couldn’t be higher. So many Pennsylvanians are facing hard times right now. After my debate in Cleveland last week I took a train. That’s what I’ve ridden a lot, an Amtrak train. From northeastern Ohio into Pittsburgh and Greensburg, Latrobe, Johnstown. And I heard the same stories everywhere, I’ve been hearing all around the country. You’re trying your best but it never feels like enough. You’re not looking for a handout. You’re just looking for a fair shot. That’s how my dad felt when we had to leave Scranton after it was no work, when coal died. He was in sales, he wasn’t a guy who was in the coal mines. Although my great-grandfather was, they tell me, the first Irish Catholic State Senator ever elected in the state of Pennsylvania, and he was a mining engineer. But I remember him saying he made that walk, which a lot of you know here in Erie.\nJoe Biden: (02:59)\nI call it the longest walk any parent has to make up a short flight of stairs to tell his kids we can’t play in that ball camp, can’t play in Green Ridge Little League anymore. You can’t go to St.Paul’s, you got to leave. Dad doesn’t have a job. I’m going to have to leave. I remember him taking us home, my mom and three children at the time, home to my grandpop’s. And I don’t know how much pride it must’ve cost him to ask my grandfather, “Will you take care of Jean and the kids? I’ll be back.” And he started commuting every weekend 157 miles down to Delaware where he had grown up. We ended up in a steel town called Claymont, Delaware. Then we went to Wilmington. My dad got a sales job and he worked hard. Took about four years to build a decent middle class life and be able to buy a home.\nJoe Biden: (03:46)\nBut it wasn’t easy for him, but he had an expression. He said, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I at least expected them to understand my problems.” America deserves a president who understands what people are going through. You’re facing real challenges right now. And the last thing you need is a president who exacerbates them. More than 210,000 are dead, as was pointed out. We lose anywhere from 700 to a thousand people a day, dead. The president was told a little while ago… When he was told a 100,000 people a day were dying, you know what he said? He says, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. More than 7.5 million Americans have been infected, and counting. 175,000 cases right here in Pennsylvania. My heart goes out to all those families who, like any of us have lost a child’s spirit, look at that empty chair at the dining room table tonight where somebody you love used to sit.\nJoe Biden: (04:53)\nMy heart goes out to everyone struggling in this economic crisis. Simple neglect on the part of this administration. There’re 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis and still have not come back. Temporary layoffs have turned into permanent layoffs. We’re still down 674,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started, and more than 40,000 manufacturing jobs here in Pennsylvania. The Trump presidency will be the first presidency since Hoover that is going to end up leaving office with fewer jobs than when he came into office. Since Hoover. But President Trump has laid… He talks about this V recovery. We went down real quick, we’re coming up quick. Well, that’s what you call a K-shape recovery. Those folks on the top of the K are doing very, very well. Recession at the top, those folks, everything’s going up for them. But everybody in the middle and below is going down, seeing things get worse.\nJoe Biden: (05:57)\nIt means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in American history. And it means while the top… This is a fact, which is startling to me when I found it out. The top 100 billionaires, in the middle of this pandemic they made $300 billion additional dollars. Hear me now? 100 individuals made $300 billion this year. And what’d the bottom half get? They got the K, they got the slide down. Because the fact is, the President can only see the world from Park Avenue. I see it from Scranton. I see it from Claymont, for real. You all know what I’m talking about. You all see it from Erie. That’s why my program to build back better is focused on working people.\nJoe Biden: (06:53)\nThink about it. Think about all the people you know who got up this morning and had the following conversation. “Honey, I know we need four new tires, they’re bald. But we can’t do it now, we got to wait. You got to wait.” Or “I know we just lost our insurance, but we’re going to be okay. We’re going to hang in there.” Or having to make a choice, literally a choice, between getting the prescription or putting food on the table. If I said to that 10 years ago you’d look at me like I was writing a fiction story, but that’s the truth. Those are decisions people are making today, right now.\nJoe Biden: (07:34)\nIndependent analysis put out by a highly respected Wall Street firm of all things, Moody’s from Wall Street firm, projects that my build back better plan’s going to create 18.6 million jobs in four years. That’s harder now. That’s not a liberal think tank, that’s Moody’s. And it’s going to create seven million more jobs than the president’s economic plan. And a trillion dollars more in economic growth than the president’s plan. And here’s how it works, I’m going to raise taxes. I’m not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than $400K, but you won’t pay a penny more. But those making more than that, I’m going to ask them to finally begin to pay the fair share. I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay. 91 of the fortune 500 companies today pay zero tax. You hear me? Zero tax. How many of you pay zero tax? And billionaires are paying at a tax rate… Because it’s all investment money, they’re paying a lower tax rate than you pay if you have a job as a plumber.\nJoe Biden: (08:46)\nHow can that be? So I’m going to raise. The money I’m going to raise, we’re going to allow us to invest in working people and grow the middle-class back, and make sure everyone comes along this time. My plan is about making the kinds of investments that are going to stimulate economic growth. To get it back to full employment fast and help us build back better than before. We’re going to create millions of good paying union jobs. I had the honor of being the guy in charge of the Recovery Act when the Great Recession occurred. The president turned to me, he used to love doing it at State of the Union messages. He’d never tell me what he was going to do. And he turns, says “And Joe, sheriff Joe’s going to take care of that $800 billion.”\nJoe Biden: (09:28)\nWell, we got it done less than two tenths of 1% waste or fraud. And we built back the longest expansion in American history. Manufacturing and technology, making sure we’re going to make the future made in America. And infrastructure, building: airports, schools, affordable housing, upgrading the water and pipes. Making sure it’s sustainable and resilient, built, laid down by union plumbers and pipe fitters here in Pennsylvania and across the country. And clean energy, we’re going to upgrade four million buildings with weatherization of two million homes. And it’s estimated that’ll create one million good paying jobs, union jobs. Union jobs to be filled by men and women like in this local here. Look folks, we’re in a situation now where if you take a look at this build back better… I’m going to take a second. But I hope I don’t take too many seconds before it rains here.\nJoe Biden: (10:28)\nNumber one, we were talking about it, Mr.President, a little while ago. He promised an infrastructure plan in 2016, ’17, ’18, ’19. He didn’t do a damn thing. Not one single bit. He promised to relieve main street slammed by the recession. But guess where that money went, that the Congress passed? It went into the Mar-a-Lago crowd, the wealthy. See, I’m not joking. It didn’t go to small businesses. It didn’t go to the people that needed it. My plan to revitalize American manufacturing infrastructure says we’re going to use by American. We’re supposed to be only buying American now.\nJoe Biden: (11:07)\nWell, I’m going to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure and clean energy. We’re going to raise over $3.7 trillion by eliminating that tax cut for the super wealthy. And folks, we’re going to: fix water pipes, pipelines, replace lead pipes, upgrade treatment plants. We’re going to construct 1.5 million new affordable housing units. We’re going to build a $100 billion dollars rebuilding our schools. We’re going to retrofit, which we started in our administration, 4 million buildings; including advanced heating and cooling system. There’s going to be such a race to job creation for unions that you’re not going to believe it, and I really mean this. And by the way, when I did the Recovery Act, which is $800 billion, not one… We had the largest infrastructure project short of Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway Program; since that.\nJoe Biden: (12:00)\nNot one single solitary dollar went to anything other than a prevailing wage. Had to be a prevailing wage. Look, I’m also going to make sure that corporate America being so kind, wanting to take over registered apprenticeships… You know what that’s all about? You guys spend a quarter billion dollars a year making sure that you have apprenticeships that are the best trained people in the world. Well folks, I’m also going to pass the PRO Act. They’re spending over $2 billion a year trying to keep you from being able to organize around the country. That’s a promise. And also strengthen labor standards, especially OSHA rules. There’s a lot we can do, but it’s not enough to praise workers. We got to make sure they get benefited.\nJoe Biden: (12:45)\nFolks, look, my dad had another expression. After he lost his job, we moved to Delaware. He’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.'” The fact is that every time the word climate change comes up Donald Trump thinks hoax. Every time it comes up, I think jobs. Let me be clear, no matter how many lies he tells, I am not, not, not banning fracking; period. We’ll also increase incomes. We’re going to see the burden and the cost with an increased 50, we’re going to make sure. Not prevailing wage. We can’t mandate that, you guys. By the way, I said inside, the other expression my dad had was, “There’s only one way to deal with the abuse of power.” Which corporate America is exercising now. “It’s with power.” And the only power we have is union power. You’re the guys that keep the ball bearings on the other side of the gate from taking everything, and that’s a fact.\nJoe Biden: (13:56)\nSo look, I’ll try to move along quickly here. The fact is that we not ease the burden on the major costs in your life. What’s the average middle-class person fear most? They’re trying to tear down the Affordable Care Act. We’re going to build on it, adding a new health insurance option. A not-for-profit public option, which is going to give private insurers real competition. We’re going to increase the subsidies so premiums are lower and we can afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses. Because we’re going to be able to do that with the money we take back from the super wealthy. We’re going to take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%.\nJoe Biden: (14:39)\nLook folks, we’re going to work with states to ensure that every three, four, and five year old has access to free high quality preschool, not daycare. You send them to preschool, there’s evidence of 58% of them will go all the way through. No matter what their background. No matter what poor school, poor neighbor they come from. You start them at age three, they have a 58% better chance of graduating all the way through high school and beyond. We’re going to make sure the low and middle income families will never have to spend more than 7% of their income caring for their young. What’s the comp… Talk to the women around here. I was a single dad for five years. I couldn’t afford help. I thank God I had my mom, and my sister, and my brother to help me with my kids when my wife and daughter were killed.\nJoe Biden: (15:24)\nWe’re going to make four year public college and universities tuition free for families making less than $125,000 a year. And when Erie gets his first new community college to open in Pennsylvania in 27 years, we’re going to make sure that it’s free for anyone who qualifies to get in. That’s a fact. And by the way, that costs a lot of money. That costs $6 billion a year. That’s about as much as we give a tax deduction for race horses. I mean this, we got to have priorities.\nJoe Biden: (15:55)\nIf you’re buying your first home? Look at all people who’ve gotten out of school since the 9/11 generation. Where they got out of high school without a graduation. Where they got out of college, no graduations. Where they thought they had these good jobs waiting for them, but they all got shut down in the Great Recession. And now, what are they doing? They’re unable to make that first home down payment. They’re out there busting their neck. And a lot of them are college graduates, some of them are beyond that. Some of have their graduate degrees and no jobs, or no access. Well, I’m going to make sure you get a tax credit for up to $15,000 for your first time home buyer; period. That’s going to provide you a down payment. We’re going to protect social security, increase benefits for millions of seniors. So he can retire with dignity in some respect.\nJoe Biden: (16:40)\nFolks look, but if we’re going to get anything done, we’ve got to come together. We’re going to have to vote like we’ve never voted before. Early voting is open here in Pennsylvania. So go vote if you can. And go to IWillVote.com/pa to find out when and where you can vote early. And if you requested a mail in ballot, return it as soon as possible. Make sure you seal it first in the secrecy envelope, and then sign the declaration on the outside of the envelope before you return it. As I said early this week on the sacred grounds of Gettysburg battlefield, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’m going to work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do.\nJoe Biden: (17:34)\nAnd I’m so proud in this campaign to have earned the support of so many proud and patriotic Republicans, including Pennsylvania’s former governor and secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge. I want to thank him publicly for his endorsement. We may not in everything. We agree on this. This is a moment to put country above party. Because after all this country’s been through, after all that America has accomplished, after all the years we’ve stood as a beacon for the rest of the world. It cannot be that here in the year 2020 we’ll allow the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to perish on this earth; as Lincoln said. We can do better. We can do better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America.\nJoe Biden: (18:24)\nAll this division being pushed by this president, all this stuff about encouraging… Here in the debate we had I ask him to condemn the Proud Boys. He said, “Stand back and stand down, but stand ready.” What’s going on here? This is not who we are. This is not who we are as a country, for real. We can argue like hell, but end of the day we come together. I am more optimistic about America’s chances today than I ever been. Why? Because I think the blinders have been taken off, people have realized what’s really at stake here. I think we can pull this together. I’m optimistic. I really genuinely am.\nJoe Biden: (19:06)\nBut here’s the deal guys, we got to go out and make sure you vote. Because, the only way we lose this is by the chicanery going on relative to polling places. This whole idea… Not a single solitary reasonable person in either party has said mail-in ballots are corrupt. No evidence, but he’s trying to make it sound that way. Trying to put people in polling places. The same guys you saw standing blocking people’s way in Virginia with banners and rifles slung across their shoulders. Folks, it’s not who we are. We’re so much better than this. So I say to you all, God bless you all. Let’s go out and vote. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Where am I going? Am I going this way? Thanks everybody. See you pal, thanks a million. Thank you! The other way, [inaudible 00:20:11].",

         "Joe Biden: (00:00)\n… a widow and a dear friend of an American hero, John McCain. We also saw the resilience and the goodness of decency of the American people. They’re not looking for a handout, they just want a fair shot. My dad used to have an expression when he lost his job up in Scranton. When I was in grade school, my dad would say, and we had to move in with my grandparents. When he went down south from Scranton to Wilmington, Delaware looking for a job. And he used to always say that, “The fact is Joey, I’m not looking for government to solve my problems but I hope like hell they can at least understand my problems.” He finally got a job, we could afford to buy a small home. He worked hard to build a decent middle class life. It wasn’t easy for him, but he had an expression.\nJoe Biden: (00:47)\nAs I said, a job joy about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s being uable to look your kidney eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” You deserve a president who understands what you’re going through. Who sees you where you are and where you want to be. The last thing you need is a president who ignores you, looks down upon you, who just doesn’t understand who in God’s name we are. That’s President Trump. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis. The destabilizing effect it’s having on our government is unconscionable. He didn’t take the necessary precautions to protect himself or others. And the longer Donald Trump is President, the more reckless he gets. How can we trust him to protect this country?\nJoe Biden: (01:44)\nGovernor, you’ve seen how he picks fights with states and pits them against one another. Look, what’s happened. More than 210,000 Americans are dead. 420,000 have been hospitalized. We lose anywhere from 700 to a thousand people every single day in America, worse than any country in the world. More than 7.5 million Americans have been infected. And we’re still counting. And here in Nevada, there have been more than 82,000 cases in total. More than 1,600 deaths. 80% of those deaths have been seniors over 60 years of age. Black, Latino, Asian American, Native-American communities are especially hit hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Latinos is almost three times higher than that of white non-Latinos and the death rate as well as three times higher. More than 40,000 Latinos have died from COVID-19. My heart goes out to all those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair around the kitchen table. Or go to dinner tonight and the person that should be there is gone.\nJoe Biden: (03:08)\nThey’ve lost part of their soul. They’ve lost part of their life. It’s all about family. With you and I it’s all about family. Losing family is a devastating thing. We can do so much better. My heart goes out to everyone struggling with the economic crisis caused by the neglect, the simple neglect of this President. Nearly 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis. And they still haven’t come back, including 136,000 jobs here in Nevada. Temporary layoffs have turned to permanent layoffs. Record growth last month and a number of Americans facing long-term unemployment. And the problem of long-term unemployment, once you get beyond a certain point, history shows us that they never get a job again.\nJoe Biden: (04:04)\nAll told, there are now 30 million workers who either lost hours, lost paychecks, or lost their jobs entirely. Roughly 700,000 people have dropped out of the labor force last month. And the vast majority were women. We’re still down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis has started. And our balance of payments deficit is going up. And here in Nevada, the unemployment rate is 13.2%, the highest in the nation because of President Trump’s negligence. The hospitality industry has hit particularly hard. The culinary union, has recently said publicly that 50% of their members are still out of work. Tourism in June was down 70% from a year ago. The result? President Trump will be the first president in modern history since Hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he came into office. Here in Nevada, after seeing over 200,000 jobs created in the last seven years of the Obama-Biden administration, Nevada has actually seen jobs go down under the Trump presidency. He’s leaving us with what he calls, he says is a V-shape recession.\nJoe Biden: (05:36)\nIt’s a K-shaped recession where those at the top keep going up and the middle-class and everyone else keeps going down, getting worse. Means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history. You get this, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just in the pandemic, the top 100 billionaires have made an additional $300 billion, top 100. But you get the bottom half of that K and it’s a downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay your bills, put food on the table. So much food insecurity in America, in this state. How to balance doing your job with being a teacher for your kids because of the negligence of the President, they can’t go back to school because they haven’t provided the wherewithal for schools to open.\nJoe Biden: (06:43)\nYou’re asked to risk your neck because you can’t work from home where the risk of COVID are kept outside. That’s because you’re a police officer, a firefighter, a nurse, or you’re working on an assembly line in customer service or a checkout counter, or here in Vegas in hospitality. If you’re a housekeeper, a casino worker, the ones who built this very stage. Governor Sisolak, your members of Congress are doing everything they possibly can to help turn things around. Governor, you’ve been focused and responsible. You followed science and put public health and safety. You made tough calls that saved lives. Working around the clock so we can reopen schools and the economy safely. Your members of Congress, have done the same.\nJoe Biden: (07:44)\nAnd the House passed what they call the HEROES Act months ago. Would have provided billions of dollars to help states keep first responders on the job. The safety measures needed, the PPP needed to open our schools and businesses but Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, Republican leader did nothing to move the legislation. Nothing in June, nothing in July, nothing in August, nothing in September, things getting worse and worse and worse. And as people struggled and suffered, what did they focus on? If this wasn’t so serious, you’d think I’m making it up. What they focused on is more tax cuts for the wealthy, not a joke. They’re proposal adds another $30 billion tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. Cuts in funding. Cutting the means by which we fund the Social Security system, leading the actuary of Social Security to say if they do it, by 2023, mid-2023, there’ll be no money for Social Security.\nJoe Biden: (08:54)\nAnd a relentless effort to eliminate, as Alejandro said, the Affordable Care Act, which provides healthcare coverage for 22 million people, over 100 million with pre-existing conditions. This is going on at the same time he’s already cost 10 million people their health insurance because their companies have gone bankrupt. It’s unconscionable. Instead of focusing on our needs, your needs, he’s trying to take your healthcare away. He’s literally before the Supreme Court as I speak to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, take away that healthcare for 20 million Americans. That’s 282,000 Nevadans. Take away federal protections for preexisting conditions, 1.2 million Nevadans. And complications from COVID like lung scarring and heart damage could well become the next pre-existing condition. Striking down the Affordable Care Act would toss out the rule that allows our children to be covered on their parents’ insurance policy until age 26. Take us backward when insurance companies could change a woman more for healthcare than a man for the same procedure, just because she’s a woman. Take away Medicare benefits for seniors. Increase their drug prescription costs.\nJoe Biden: (10:28)\nAnd just as he vowed to “terminate” as I said earlier the funding for Social Security. The idea that in just a few years could put at risk 410,000 Nevadans that rely on a dignified retirement because of Social Security. And during all this, not once did President Trump call a high-level meeting of Democrats and Republicans to the White House to resolve these issues. I’ve served with a lot of presidents, never, no matter how good or bad you thought they were did they fail to try to bring parties together in the White House to reach a settlement. You know why? He spent so much time hiding in the bunker in the White House or on the bunker of his golf course, playing hundreds of rounds of golf.\nJoe Biden: (11:27)\nAnd then this Tuesday, what’d he do? He said, “End the discussions.” He wasn’t even starting them. No more negotiations. No more negotiations. And now today he says, “Well, I’m back.” One thing for sure, Donald Trump shows no urgency to deliver hardworking Americans, like the family I grew up in. Like all of you. What they need now desperately. For exactly two months since the emergency small business program that your congresspeople voted, for has closed down two months of small business owners in Nevada and across the country, waiting, hoping, for just a little extra help to be able to stay open. Now we have more than 400,000 small businesses have been permanently closed.\nJoe Biden: (12:20)\nBy the way, the largest employers in America are small businesses. Millions more are struggling to hang on. How many more will go under? How many more dreams will be extinguished because of the selfishness of this President and the Republican leaders in Congress? Make no mistake, if you’re out of work, if your business is closed, if your child’s school was shut down, if you’re facing eviction, as millions are, over 20 million Americans worry about whether they’re going to be able to pay their mortgage next month. None of that seems to matter to Donald Trump. You’re a firefighter, police officer, who depends on state and local budgets. He’s turned his back on you as well, because they’ve got to balance their budgets. They’re being laid off all over America.\nJoe Biden: (13:12)\nWhen Barack and I were elected, we inherited the worst recession short of the Great Depression in history. He put me in charge of what’s called the Recovery Act. $800 billion. We passed and needed to get out into the economy within 18 months to prevent a depression. We did it with less than two tenths percent of waste or fraud. And I was able to see to it that the states in order to keep moving, keep teachers, firefighters, first responders, all employed. I was able to get $140 billion in aid out to the states. Right here in Clark County, I was able to bring to $1.2 billion to keep your economy going. We have that ability now.\nJoe Biden: (14:04)\nThe House has already passed a similar piece of legislation. And we started the longest sustained recovery in American history. But you know what Mitch McConnell said about help with the states. I’m not making this up. He said, “Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt.” What in the hell is he talking about? Folks, we’re so much better than this. We can turn this crisis into progress. We contain this virus and fully reopen our economy. We make up 4% of the world’s population and we have 20% of the world’s deaths. If we just follow the science, expand testing and tracing, social distance, washing our hands, implementing nationwide mask mandates. Don’t politicize the race for a vaccine, Mr. President. Just have a plan for safe and equitable distribution.\nJoe Biden: (15:14)\nOn the economy, bring the Congress back together to pass real relief to help people who’ve lost their unemployment checks as well. And then implement a comprehensive agenda that I’ve laid out to make bold investments so we can build back better. He keeps talking about the Republicans. Some Republicans, a lot of them are acknowledging and supporting me, but a lot of them also are talking about, “Well, Biden’s going to spend all this money.” Well, guess what? The independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm did a detailed analysis of my recovery plan and the President’s. And here’s what they said, it’s off of Wall Street, that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs in four years. 7 million more jobs than the President’s plan. And $1 trillion more in economic growth than the President’s plan.\nJoe Biden: (16:18)\nDemocrats know how to get things done. Here’s how my plan works. It’s not going to raise a penny in tax for anyone making less than $400,000 a year. Not a penny. And how am I going to pay for all this? I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to start paying their fair share. You realize that the Fortune 500 companies, 92 of them making billions of dollars, don’t pay a single penny in taxes. It’s wrong. Donald Trump paying $720 in taxes? Come on. The money we raise by eliminating the $1.3 trillion of his $2 trillion tax cut that affects the super wealthy and corporations, we’re going to invest in working people. We’re going to grow the middle class to make sure everyone’s included on the deal.\nJoe Biden: (17:23)\nThe kinds of investment that will stimulate the economy, including industries like tourism and hospitality. To get back to full employment fast and help build back better than before. It means the analysis shows creating millions of good paying union jobs. Manufacturing and technology. Making sure our future is made in America. We and the President in the White House gives out $600 billion in contracts per year. Well guess what? While I’m President, it’s going to go to no outfit that doesn’t make it in America, the whole thing, and sell it in America. I mean it.\nJoe Biden: (18:17)\nAnd infrastructure. Building roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, and clean energy. Upgrading four million buildings and weatherizing, two million homes, creating at least a million good paying jobs in the process. Making the climate safer, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. We’ll deal with climate change by creating millions of union jobs that build a climate resilience of our cities and our towns fighting back stronger, more frequent wildfires. Beating heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, and floods. By the way, did you hear what the President said about hurricanes this summer? He was told about how they’re coming across the warm water in the Atlantic and the closer they get to the shore, the worse they get. You know what he said, Alejandro? He said, “Maybe we should drop an atomic weapon on them and blow them up.” As we say in my religion, “Bless me father for I have sinned.” What’s going on here?\nJoe Biden: (19:27)\nUnder my plan, small business come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. We’re going to get $50 billion in new capital, especially for minority owned businesses and small businesses. We’re going to make another hundred billion dollars in low-interest loans available to these businesses, creating jobs, increasing economic growth and increasing incomes. A $15 minimum wage. I’m dreaming here. But a $15 minimum wage for our essential workers. We’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to pay you with a good wage. Ensure you have strong benefits. We’ll ease the burden of the major cost in your life. We’ll build the Affordable Care Act, writing knew health insurance options, not for-profit public options, which give private insurers a real competitor. We’re going to increase subsidies for premiums and lower your costs. Increase plans that will lower deductibles and lower out of pocket expenses. And we’re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry with a plan that will slash costs of prescription drugs by 50%.\nJoe Biden: (20:44)\nThe reason I’m not going to more detail, you’ve been out here a long time, let’s give me one example. If in fact Medicare is able to negotiate for all the drugs they buy and say you’re not going to be able to sell them to them unless you pay the price we’re suggesting, that would drop by 60% the cost the cost of drugs.\nJoe Biden: (21:06)\nWe’ll also make high quality childcare available and accessible. We’ll work with the states to ensure that every three, four year old will get access to free, high quality preschool. Not, not, not daycare. We’re going to make sure low and middle income families never have to spend more than 7% of their income to care for young children. Because if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burdens that created the care for families that are caring for raising a child and an aging loved one. Look at the professional caregivers out there, home health care workers, childcare workers, who are more often women. Women of color immigrants, are too often underpaid, under seen and undervalued. That’s why my Build Back Better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. We’re also going to triple the funding for Title I schools like the one behind me here, which served high number of children from low-income families.\nJoe Biden: (22:11)\nWe’re going to make four years of public college and universities tuition free for any family that makes less than $125,000 a year. We’re going to make community college and job training programs free for all hardworking Americans that qualify. And if you’re buying your first home, we’re going to provide a $15,000 tax credit to help you get there. We’re going to protect Social Security. Increase benefits for millions of seniors. Look, I’m not going to lay it out, but go to joebiden.com. Go to Moody’s, look it up. We pay for all this and we grow the economy at the same time.\nJoe Biden: (22:54)\nThe fact is, President of the United States can only see the world from Park Avenue. He thinks Wall Street built this country and CEOs. I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont. Communities like some that you live in. I know the middle-class working people built this country. The measure of economic success has been what our families are talking about around the kitchen table. Are you able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay?”\nJoe Biden: (23:27)\nHow many times do you know somebody… This morning I had to say, look, I know those tires are bald, but you got to ride on them for another 20,000 miles. We just don’t have the money. We just can’t do it now.” Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to school because we can’t continue to borrow the money to keep her in that community college? There was a discussion that took place around my table and I’m sure yours as well. But if we’re going to get anything done, we got to come together.\nJoe Biden: (23:57)\nI made a speech I worked really, really hard on and thought really hard about before I made it in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the battlefield last week. I said at that time that we’re facing a crisis, not unlike we did after Gettysburg. I said there that I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. The work is hard for those who don’t support me as those who do, because after all this country has been through, after all that America has accomplished, after all the years, we stood as a beacon of light to the world we cannot be that here and now, in 2020, we allow the government, the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to perish from this earth.\nJoe Biden: (25:01)\nFolks, we have it our hands. And I made this in the bottom of heart, we have in our hands the ultimate power. And what’s the ultimate power in a democracy? The power to vote. Here in Nevada, the best thing you can do is vote early and return your ballot quickly. Ballots here in Clark County were mailed two days ago, on Wednesday. You can return your ballot by mail. You can drop it off at a drop box or vote in person during the early vote or on election day. But just make a plan. Seriously, go to iwillvote.com/nv. Make a plan. Don’t risk any delays, return that mail and ballot as soon as you can. Make sure your voice is heard.\nJoe Biden: (25:58)\nWe can be better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. I’m confident we can bring Democrats and Republicans together again with him gone. Folks, conclude by saying there has never, ever, ever been anything the United States has been unable to accomplish when we’ve done it together. Never, never, never. So folks let’s stand up and vote and take back this country now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. (silence)",

         "Donald Trump: (00:02)\nThank you.\nAudience: (00:02)\nUSA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.\nDonald Trump: (00:49)\nWell, thank you very much and keep that enthusiasm going, get out and vote. We got to vote. We got to vote these people into oblivion, vote them into oblivion. Got to get rid of them so bad for our country. First of all, I’m feeling great. I don’t know about you. How’s everyone feeling? Good? And I’m honored to welcome, we call this a peaceful protest to the White House in support of the incredible men and women of law enforcement and all of the people that work so well with us. I have to tell you our black community, our Hispanic community, thank you very much. Thank you.\nDonald Trump: (01:32)\nBut before going any further, I want to thank all of you for your prayers. I know you’ve been praying and I was in that hospital. I was watching down over so many people and I went out to say hello to those people. And I took a little heat for it, but I’d do it again. And let me tell you, I’d do it again. On behalf of myself and the First Lady, this has been really an incredible outpouring and we’re starting very, very big with our rallies and with our everything, because we cannot allow our country to become a socialist nation. We cannot let that happen. And that’s what would happen or worse, by the way or worse.\nDonald Trump: (02:17)\nI want you to know our nation’s going to defeat this terrible China virus, as we call it and we’re producing powerful therapies and drugs and we’re healing the sick and we’re going to recover. And the vaccine is coming out very, very quickly in record time. As you know, it’s coming out very, very soon. We have great, great companies doing it and there’ll be distributing it. And we will through our military very, very rapidly, through the power of the American spirit, I think more than anything else, science medicine will eradicate the China virus once and for all. We’ll get rid of it all over the world. You see big flare ups in Europe, big flare ups in Canada, very big flare up in Canada, you saw that today. A lot of flare ups, but it’s going to disappear. It is disappearing and with vaccines are going to help and the therapeutics are going to help a lot.\nDonald Trump: (03:11)\nI just want to thank everyone this afternoon. What beautiful colors. Where did you get that color Candace? Where did that come from? What a beautiful color. I want to get one of them. I want to put one of them on instead of a white shirt. I want to thank you though, seriously.\nDonald Trump: (03:31)\nEvery day, more black and Latino Americans are leaving behind left wing politicians and their failed ideology. It’s what they are. They failed for many years and many, many decades. Democrats have run nearly every inner city in America and I mean, for 100 years and their policies have delivered nothing but calamity, poverty and trouble. Sleepy Joe Biden has betrayed black and Latino Americans. If you think he can run this country, you’re wrong. For half a century, shipping your jobs to China, that’s what they’ve been doing. We’re bringing the jobs back. We’ve been bringing them back. We’ve been charging China a lot of money too, with the tariffs, a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars.\nDonald Trump: (04:20)\nOpening your borders to mass illegal immigration. The wall is now 380 miles long. It’ll soon be finished. Trapping us in endless foreign wars, these ridiculous foreign wars that lasts for 19 years, our people are coming back home you know that. And selling you out to the rich global as Wall Street donors, they have the Wall Street donors. They want the Wall Street donors. Someday somebody is going to have to write a little story about that.\nDonald Trump: (04:49)\nBlack and Latino Americans are rejecting the radical socialists left and they’re embracing our pro jobs, pro worker, pro-police. We want law and order. We have to have law and order and pro-American agenda. I want to thank the Blexit Foundation for organizing this event. Thank you very much. Thank you. And especially your two founders, two friends of mine, great people, Candace Owens and former Tucson police officer, Brandon Tatum. Thank you, both. Great job. What a great job. Two really brilliant, smart young people. Great. And thank you very much for being here. We really appreciate it.\nDonald Trump: (05:35)\nSo you’ve just marched to the White House because you understand to protect the lives of black Americans and all Americans, you have to have your police support you. You have to have that. If the left gains power, they’ll launch a nationwide crusade against law enforcement, and they’ve already done that. And you see them. They’re doing that at a level that nobody’s ever seen before.\nDonald Trump: (05:59)\nThe other day in the debate Biden couldn’t even use the words law enforcement. I said, “Say law enforcement. Say law enforcement,” and he was bailed out by the anchor. Then I said, very simply I said, “Name one law enforcement group that’s supporting you,” he couldn’t do it, but he was bailed out by the anchor. Second time bailed. He got bailed out by that anchor a lot. Taking their funds away, their firearms, their fundamental authorities, taking everything away, including your freedom. Joe Biden even said, “When you call 911, a therapist should answer the call.” That doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. But this is the people telling him what, because he doesn’t say, he’s told what to say.\nDonald Trump: (06:41)\nYou saw what they introduced today. They’ve gone through a period of years. No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. All of a sudden gets a nomination, he says, “There’s got to be fracking.” For Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, all of you, there will be if it happens, all of those jobs are gone. Your energy jobs are gone if they get in. Just remember I said it. Just to remember.\nSpeaker 3: (07:04)\nIt’s not going to happen.\nDonald Trump: (07:06)\nI don’t think so either. And I have to say ,there’s been more enthusiasm. We have had more enthusiasm right now, right now this year than we had four years ago by a factor of three times. And we had a lot and they had none. They have no enthusiasm.\nAudience: (07:37)\nMore four years. More four years. More four years. More four years. More four years. More four years. More four years. More four years.\nDonald Trump: (07:39)\nThey have no enthusiasm. In fact, the gap is so incredible and a poll just came out, I think it said 56% of the people prefer their position now in the midst of a pandemic than they did four years ago. Think of what that means. 56. And it’s a Gallup poll and it’s the highest poll ever recorded. 56%. Now tell me about that. No, we had it going and we really had it going and then the plague came in from China but we’re getting rid of that and we’re rebuilding it and it’s going to be better than it was even before.\nDonald Trump: (08:12)\nBut the homes and churches and businesses of black and Hispanic Americans have been looted, you know that. They’ve been vandalized and burned by left wing fanatics, total bad people. They know what they’re doing, yet Biden likes to call them peaceful protesters. You see people, you see anchors from a couple of the very bad, very corrupt networks standing and behind them, the cities are burning and they’re saying, “This is a peaceful protest,” and you look, and everything’s on fire.\nDonald Trump: (08:45)\nI want to thank our law enforcement and I want to thank everybody in the community, in the community drives that are working with law enforcement. I want to thank them. I think we have the support of every law enforcement group in this country practically. I don’t know of any that I don’t. Maybe there must be some, there must be one. They’ll find one tonight. They’ll say, “No, he misrepresented.” But we have a level of support the likes of which nobody’s I don’t think ever seen before. I don’t think so. And you’re going to see that.\nDonald Trump: (09:15)\nDo you see how many crooked ballots are being found and turned back in and fraudulent? Just what I said. Then they’ll say, “He doesn’t believe in freedom.” I totally believe in freedom. That’s called freedom. What we’re doing is freedom. Tremendous problems with the ballots. 50,000 in Ohio, 25,000… You have to see it. I mean, every day there’s a story about ballots. Some thrown out that happen to have the name Trump, military ballots were thrown out with the name Trump on them. But I think we’re going to swamp them by so much. Hopefully, it’s not going to matter. And we have law enforcement watching. We have law enforcement watching all those ballots, they’re being found for a reason.\nDonald Trump: (10:00)\nLeft wing politicians like Kamala Harris who really did not do very well the other night. By the way, did our Vice-President do a good job, Candace? That was easy for him. No, he did a great job because we’re in the side of right. We really are. We’re on the side of right. And by the way we are, and it’s true and I say it and I say it all the time now, more and more, we are draining the swamp like nobody in history has ever drained the swamp. Nobody in history has ever drained.\nDonald Trump: (10:36)\nWe’re here today to deliver a united message to police officers all across our great land that are American. And I mean every American, every race and color, we love you. Every race, color, creed, we support you. We honor you. It’s a dangerous profession. They’ve been doing an incredible job and I just want to thank them on behalf of everybody here today, because that’s why we’re safe.\nDonald Trump: (11:03)\nIn contrast, the Democrat’s socialist program and platform, and it really is more than socialist. It’s not just socialist, it’s beyond socialism. He says, “Communist.” Yeah, that’s about right. But I recently announced my plan to deliver more opportunities, security, fairness, and prosperity to the black community, to the Hispanic community. And you know what it is. I don’t have to go over it, but it’s the Platinum Plan. And it’s going to bring back new jobs, like at a level that you’ve never seen before. And we’ve done a lot. We’ve done a lot, but increase capital. It’s going to increase money coming into the black community, to the Hispanic community where it’s been very much shut out, in advance, very much home ownership and wealth building. And it’s already taking place and it’s taking place at a level, and had we not been hit by the pandemic, you would have seen numbers like you’ve never seen before, but those numbers are already rebuilding again.\nDonald Trump: (12:07)\nWe’re going to build up a peaceful and safer neighborhood program like you haven’t seen with the highest standards of policing, we’ll create a healthcare system that delivers better care at a lower cost. Obamacare is a disaster. We want to terminate it. We want to get great healthcare. And that’s what we’re doing. Great healthcare. And we’ll always take care of pre-existing conditions, always. And I think we’re at a point where we’re getting and right now if you look at what we’ve done in healthcare, people don’t talk about it. We’ve done an incredible job. Less expensive healthcare… Much better healthcare at a much less expensive price. You can’t do better than that. And it’s happening and it’s happening fast.\nDonald Trump: (12:51)\nAnother thing is school choice. You have to have school choice. Charter schools, school choice. So I make this statement every once in a while and people think it’s a little bit in the bull side but we’ve achieved a historic reduction of violent crime, we signed a landmark criminal justice reform bill that nobody thought was possible to even think about. I did that. I did that. I got that done. And I worked with a lot of people, but we got it done. The Obama administration couldn’t get it done. Biden couldn’t even think about it. He doesn’t even know what it is.\nDonald Trump: (13:30)\nWe have prison reform. We achieved the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rate in the history of our country. The black youth unemployment rate reached the lowest ever again in the history of our country. And last year, black and Hispanic American poverty reached the lowest ever in the history of our country. It’s all building back up so quickly. And if you look at what we’ve done with criminal justice reform, if you look at what we’ve done with historically black colleges and universities, where we funded them, they couldn’t get funded. Nobody was funding that for years and years and decades, nobody was funding them.\nDonald Trump: (14:11)\nAnd if you look at what we’ve done with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Opportunity Zones and the jobs created. And I’ve said it very strongly and perhaps, I don’t know, criminal justice reform, people say, maybe that’s the best of all but the fact is they’re all great. Every one of them is great. And I say, the fact is that I’ve done more for the black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln. I say it. Nobody can dispute it. Nobody can dispute it, it’s true. Nobody can dispute it.\nDonald Trump: (14:40)\nSo we are now beginning the fastest economic recovery in history. We created a record 11.4 million jobs just in the last four months. That’s the fastest ever. The US has seen the smallest economic contraction of any major nation anywhere in the world. So we’ve seen the smallest going down. If you look at it, that’s an incredible statement. Our opponents will crush the comeback with unscientific lockdowns. They want to lock everything down. Here we go again. They want to lock it down. We’re not going to let it happened. We’re not going to let it happen. So important you get out and vote. You got to get out and vote.\nDonald Trump: (15:20)\nWe got a great poll in Florida. Got a great poll in North Carolina. Got a great poll in Arizona. Got a great poll in Nevada, actually. Just got a great poll in Nevada. I think we’re doing really well. I mean, this is in addition to states that we’re going to win. Georgia is looking fantastic. Texas is looking for fantastic. Well, think about Texas, they have no oil, they don’t want oil. They don’t want guns. They don’t want religion. I don’t think you’re going to win Texas very well. Now, we’ve got a great poll in Texas. We’re getting great polls all over the place and they understand it. It’s driving them crazy. And you know why though? And Candace, it is. It’s because of the spirit. There’s a spirit the likes of which this country hasn’t seen in a very, very long time.\nDonald Trump: (16:07)\nSo I just want to thank you all for being on the White House lawn and this beautiful great lawn and I’m very proud of this country. I’m very, very proud. I want to thank all of the doctors and labs and scientists and all of the people that are working so hard because we’re way ahead of everybody. But I just want to thank most particularly you because you people come out and you come out and you cheer and you love your country and you get it. You’re way, way ahead, of many, many people in this country, but the country is getting it. The country is seeing something now.\nAudience: (16:43)\nWe love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.\nDonald Trump: (16:46)\nThank you. I love you too.\nDonald Trump: (16:56)\nThe people of our country and the whole world is watching, are seeing things now that they haven’t seen in this country for decades. They’re seeing a spirit and a resilience like they haven’t seen. I just want to thank you and get out and vote. We got to make this bigger than even four years ago. It’s more important. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. This is more important than even four years ago. I used to say the most important and it was true at the time. This is the single most important election in the history of our country. Get out and vote. And I love you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nDonald Trump: (17:30)\nThank you. Thank you, Candace. Thank you. Thank you [inaudible 00:17:37].\nSpeaker 4: (18:38)\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. Please make your way to the south-",

         "Speaker 1: (00:00)\nBut right now, we’re going to go to Spartanburg and join Amy Wood. WSPA-TV. [crosstalk 00:00:05].\nLindsey Graham: (00:07)\nFocused on the needs of the United States.\nSpeaker 2: (00:07)\nAnd challenger Jamie Harrison.\nJamie Harrison: (00:09)\nAnd I’ll fight for you as hard as I would for my family.\nSpeaker 2: (00:13)\nTonight, a live discussion on the issues important to you, the pandemic, the economy, education. From your local election headquarters, the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, and Nexstar Media, the U.S. Senate Race South Carolina, a live candidate conversation.\nAmy Wood: (00:32)\nAnd good evening and thank you for joining us tonight. We are coming to you live from the WSPA-TV studios in Spartanburg, South Carolina. I’m Amy Wood, evening anchor at WSPA, and tonight’s conversation will be live streamed and broadcast on our Nexstar network across the Carolinas, as well as our partner station WLTX in Columbia. Many of you turned in this evening to watch the candidates for U.S. Senate in their second debate. Both campaigns agreed to the format of that debate, but this week, campaign staff for Democratic challenger Jamie Harrison asked that the incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham be tested for COVID. The Senator was tested last Friday. In a statement released yesterday afternoon, the Harrison campaign wrote, “I cannot responsibly debate in person tomorrow night and allow politics to put my family, my campaign staff, Senator Graham’s staff, and members of the media at unnecessary risk.”\nAmy Wood: (01:26)\nThe Graham campaign responded, “Mr. Harrison is demanding special treatment. If Mr. Harrison is not able to interact with South Carolinians on the same terms they live their lives, he should not be their Senator.” Because of this impasse, we have changed the format of the forum tonight. At the bottom of the hour, Senator Lindsey Graham will face the same panel with equal time directly following Mr. Harrison’s interview. WSPA and Nexstar Media have taken steps to provide a safe environment here tonight. This environment has been sanitized and the candidates and our panel are separated at a safe distance. Now, let’s meet our panel. From WCBD in Charleston, anchor Carolyn Murray, and WSPA anchor Gordon Dill. Gordon will ask our first question.\nGordon Dill: (02:14)\nAll right. Amy, thank you, and good evening, Mr. Harrison. Thank you for being here. I want to talk about your COVID precautions. As Amy said, it’s the reason we’re not having a debate tonight. You did a debate last week where you brought your own plexiglass shield with you. You had one delivered to the studios here in advance of the debate. If you’re insisting that the person you’re debating have a COVID test, what is the purpose of the plexiglass? Is that a political prop?\nJamie Harrison: (02:38)\nNo, it’s being safe. Listen, right now Senator Graham just this past week was in a room, in a hearing room, with two people who have tested positive for the Coronavirus, two Senators who are now quarantined at home. We have to take this thing seriously. The President of United States has been out of pocket because he has the Coronavirus. When you take a look at this and Senator Graham said that folks want special treatment. Nobody’s asking for special treatment. What we’re asking is for our senior Senator to take this seriously. He has gone to events and hasn’t worn a mask at some of those events. He sat on the White House lawn with 1000 people maskless. And so what I am saying is as someone who has a pre-existing condition, and I don’t know the conditions of all of you and your staffs and the other staffs, we need our leaders to actually lead by example.\nJamie Harrison: (03:31)\nNow take a look at this. After the president announced that he had the Coronavirus, we’ve had several debates across this country since then. Vice President Pence took a Coronavirus test. Senator Cornyn just today took a Coronavirus test. Susan Collins just took a Coronavirus test and it’s because they’re being responsible because they were in meetings in which folks have had the Coronavirus. I don’t understand why Senator Graham is asking for a special treatment when all we are saying, let’s keep people safe. Because you know what? It is a five minute test. You go in, you get a swab, they swab it in your nose, and it’s less than 30 minutes and you get an answer for it.\nGordon Dill: (04:14)\nBut Mr. Harrison, you’re asking to represent millions of South Carolinians and you don’t know their condition either. 150,000 of them have confirmed cases of COVID. Are you not going to meet with them unless they have a COVID test?\nJamie Harrison: (04:26)\nWell, listen, but this is the difference. Senator Graham and I are vying to be leaders in this state. We are also asking people to wear a mask and Senator Graham doesn’t do that as well. Let me tell you, this is some real stuff. 3,500 South Carolinians have lost their lives. 150,000 have been infected and one who lost her life was my aunt, Gladys, who died alone in a nursing home. This is impacting families in a way that we have never seen in our lives, and so what we need is somebody to be serious about this.\nJamie Harrison: (04:59)\n750,000 South Carolinians have lost their job. 400,000 of them lost their healthcare as well. All we are asking is for one of the top leaders in the state to lead by example. Don’t hold rallies without a mask, make sure that you’re washing your hands, and when you’re in a forum where you’re interacting with folks after you have been in a room with two people who have contracted the Coronavirus, that you actually get a test. That’s all we’re asking. It doesn’t take a whole lot to do that and I just don’t understand why Senator Graham’s colleagues can do it, the Vice President of the United States can do it, and why he thinks he’s special enough that he can’t.\nGordon Dill: (05:38)\nAll right. Thank you, Mr. Harrison. Carolyn?\nCarolyn Murray: (05:39)\nGordon, thank you. Continuing with the same conversation talking about COVID-19, Senator Graham has presented us with a doctor’s note indicating that he did not necessarily need to be tested. This is the same doctor who would in fact take care of you if you are in fact elected. Do you believe that that doctor’s note is sufficient?\nJamie Harrison: (06:01)\nWell, I’m not sure, but I do know that Dr. Fauci just said yesterday that the White House event that started this all, the cascading event, was a super spreading event. And we all have to take this stuff seriously and I don’t believe that our Senator has. Very early on, he was in those rooms. We all read and heard Bob Woodard talk about the president and what the president said in terms of how they tried to talk down the Coronavirus initially. Senator Graham helped set up the interviews. He was actually in the room. I remember the early interviews in which he tried to talk down this as well and he said, “Well, if 50,000 people die for it, that is success.” And then if 75,000 and 100,000 or 150,000.\nJamie Harrison: (06:49)\nThis is something that is impacting so many people and it breaks my heart to hear the stories of folks saying that they can’t properly say goodbye to loved ones because they can’t hold their hands, they can’t be in the emergency room when their loved one is passing away. It is important that we take this stuff seriously because it’s impacting us as a society in a way that we have never seen before.\nCarolyn Murray: (07:12)\nMr. Harrison, first of all, sorry for your loss. I appreciate you sharing that with us. Another quick question for you. It is about the national mask mandate. As you’ve described, the White House is now described as a hotspot. We know that dozens of people associated with the Trump campaign have tested positive for COVID-19 and many of those people were seen at large gatherings not wearing masks. The question for you is, do you believe there should be a national mask mandate?\nJamie Harrison: (07:37)\nI do and I guess somebody like Mitch McConnell believes the same thing because he just recently said that he won’t go over to the White House because they have different standards as it relates to the Coronavirus. We have to take this seriously. And when we look at other nations, New Zealand is a perfect example. Nations who are almost Coronavirus-free at this point in time because they came up with a national plan for how they were going to address this, instead of saying, well, each state is different.\nJamie Harrison: (08:05)\nWell, listen, we don’t have walls on the borders of our states. People get on an airplane and fly from one… My in-laws live in Utah. I live here in South Carolina. It is easy for us to get on a plane, fly there, but if I’m taking the Coronavirus with me now, not only am I impacting the people in that plane, but I’m also impacting the people in the location that I’m going, and then those people impact other folks. There are no walls on the borders of each of our United States, and so we had to come up with a comprehensive plan in order to address this and we failed to do that.\nCarolyn Murray: (08:37)\nThank you, Mr. Harrison. Gordon?\nGordon Dill: (08:39)\nGiven how serious COVID is in your description, students all over the country have to show an immunization record to return to class. If there’s a COVID-19 vaccine, should they be required to have that to return to class?\nJamie Harrison: (08:54)\nThat’s a possibility and I think we’ve probably have to look at that. It’s really, really important. It’s part of the reason why we do contact tracing. It’s part of the reason why we have to be thoughtful in the process to make sure that nobody is impacted and infected by something that we are still learning so much about. And so I think, again, it’s in our best interest for us to take this as seriously as we possibly can so that we can get back to normal. But if we continue to try to be lax with how we deal with this issue, then we are going to lag behind all of the other nations that have taken positive steps forward to get the Coronavirus behind them and instead of in front of them.\nGordon Dill: (09:36)\nSo you would consider a national mandate for school children to get the vaccine?\nJamie Harrison: (09:39)\nWell, just like we ask for kids that have flu shots as they go in, we probably have to think about the same thing.\nGordon Dill: (09:46)\nWhat about the people who are concerned about the safety of the vaccine? What do you say to them?\nJamie Harrison: (09:51)\nWell, I think at this point we need the scientists and not politicians. If you asked me, “Jamie, this is a good vaccine for me to take,” I would tell you, you don’t need to ask me. You need to ask someone who actually understands this stuff in terms of doctors and the scientists. And so if Dr. Fauci who I believe folks on all sides of the aisle and in the middle, if Dr. Fauci says that this is a reliable vaccine, something that we have tested, something that has gone through the processes that we usually have for these type of things, and we feel that it’s a good for the American people to take, I’ll take it. But I’m not going to take it if it’s Lindsey Graham telling me that I need to take it because, again, Senator Graham and I aren’t doctors, and so we need to rely upon them to give us the best advice.\nGordon Dill: (10:39)\nAll right. Thank you. Carolyn?\nCarolyn Murray: (10:41)\nMr. Harrison, African Americans represent 27% of South Carolina’s population, but of the 3,500 people who’ve died in our state, 35% of those people were black. What will you do to ensure access to medical care and healthcare for all people in our state?\nJamie Harrison: (11:01)\nYeah. You know what the Coronavirus did was it exacerbated problems that were already here, and I remember just hearing about the Coronavirus and cringing because I knew the impact that it would have here in South Carolina, particularly on the most vulnerable communities. We live in the state where almost 250,000 people don’t have access to healthcare because we’re one of 12 states that have refused to expand Medicaid. 38 other states have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and South Carolina has failed to do so. And as a result, four of our rural hospitals in this state have closed and we’re seeing that same type of trend in the other states that refuse to expand Medicaid.\nJamie Harrison: (11:42)\nIf you live in one of those communities, and it doesn’t matter if you’re black and white, it doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican, and you have complications with diabetes or you’re impacted by the Coronavirus or you have with a pregnancy, instead of taking you 10 or 15 minutes like it used to to get to the nearest hospital, now it takes you 25 or 35 or 45 minutes. That’s a death sentence. And what those folks are looking for, they’re not looking for a Democratic solution or a Republican solution, a solution from Jamie Harrison and one from Lindsey Graham, they’re just looking for a solution. And we have a responsibility to the people here in South Carolina that the leadership and Lindsey Graham is emblematic of it, he’s been here 25 years and failed to do so. I have gone to some of these communities that have lost their hospital and they have told me that Lindsey Graham hasn’t even shown up since they have. We can do better, particularly on health.\nJamie Harrison: (12:34)\nIn this state two years ago, 14 of our 46 counties had no OB/GYNs. None, zero, zilch, none. We’re in the 21st century and 14 counties in South Carolina don’t have any OB/GYNs and we’re serious about healthcare? And then we have a Senator who comes up with a healthcare plan that he thought of in a barbershop where he doesn’t protect folks with preexisting conditions, where he puts a senior tax on seniors, and he block grants the money and reduces the amount of money. Let’s be serious about healthcare and it doesn’t have to be a partisan thing. Let us be focused on the health of every single South Carolinian and that’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to fight to expand Medicaid. I’m going to fight to strengthen the Affordable Care Act so that every person can have healthcare, whether it’s given to them by their employer or because they go into some type of public option.\nCarolyn Murray: (13:30)\nMr. Harrison, I’d also like to talk to you about the stimulus relief package. Just this week, negotiations broke down to provide a second round of relief to families and businesses affected by COVID-19. Well now that the first round has expired, people are losing their jobs, they’re losing their healthcare, they’re losing their businesses. How would you work beyond the aisle, across the aisle, and foster bipartisan support to pass something to help not only the nation’s families, but families right here in your beloved community?\nCarolyn Murray: (14:03)\n… only the nation’s families, but families right here in your beloved community of South Carolina.\nJamie Harrison: (14:05)\nYeah. Thank you for that question. It breaks my heart to talk to small business owners and folks, those who are on unemployment right now and desperately needed that federal unemployment benefit. Again, I said 750,000 South Carolinians have lost their job as a result of this coronavirus and many of them lost their healthcare as well. And, our Senator, Senator Graham said, “Over his dead body or over our dead bodies, will he allow an extension of the unemployment benefit.” Yet as a result, because the benefit ran out in August, there are so many folks who are on the verge of being kicked out of their homes. They’re on the verge of not being able to pay their bills. And our Senator who is so out of touch didn’t understand why it was important to continue that benefit. That benefit brought $20-some-odd million into the South Carolina’s economy every week. Every week.\nJamie Harrison: (14:57)\nSo not only did it benefit the families, but it also benefited the small businesses that are on the verge of closing. South Carolina, I don’t know if folks know this, South Carolina is ranked 50th in the nation, as it relates to PPP dollars per worker. That means 49 other states are getting more money for their small businesses to stay open than South Carolina did. And so for me, in the end of the day, this is about what can we do to improve the state, not about Washington politics. And so I’ll work with anybody who is looking forward to trying to build progress. And that means staying in session. Lindsey Graham and the Senate went out of session for vacation in August. And it means we need to stay in session and get it done. And I wish the Senator would take the urgency he has for the Supreme Court nomination to put that into actually doing a bill to address the needs of the folks in South Carolina on coronavirus.\nCarolyn Murray: (15:55)\nGordon.\nGordon Dill: (15:55)\nWell, it’s convenient, Mr. Harrison, you mentioned the Supreme Court. That’s our next topic. I know you want to talk about the process of confirmation. But before you do that, is Amy Coney-Barrett qualified to serve as a justice on the US Supreme Court?\nJamie Harrison: (16:10)\nWell, she’s … I mean, she was qualified to be in terms of the district court. And so, but I would need to ask her some questions to find out where she stands on certain issues, particularly in terms of the civil rights that have been gained in this country for so many groups. And so hopefully, those questions will be asked of her in her confirmation hearings. But we shouldn’t even be talking about confirmation hearings right now if we would listen to Lindsey Graham and followed his word. Lindsey Graham said that, he said, “Use my words against me. We should not be considering a justice in the fourth year, in an election year.” And that he would not vote for it, such justice. I learned, and I think many of us learned here in South Carolina that a man and a woman are as good as their word. And what is the word of Lindsey Graham worth?\nGordon Dill: (17:03)\nWell, what is your position then? Do you have a rule you follow on when it is and is not appropriate to confirm a president’s nomination?\nJamie Harrison: (17:10)\nWell, my rule is the precedent in the standards of the United States Senate. In 2016, the rule was that you should, whenever a president nominees, it should be considered. Then Lindsey Graham and others changed that rule and set a new precedent. And now he is going against his word and the precedent that was set. So, in essence, so if this is a new precedent, then I’m going to follow this new precedent. But if we’re going to be a nation of laws and rules, then let’s follow those rules. Yeah, I said the other night, it almost feels like I’m playing monopoly with my six-year-old son, that you change the rules whenever it benefits you. And that’s not the way that this country needs to run. And so I’m going to always follow the rules. People will always know, even if they don’t agree with me, they will always know that I’m going to tell them the truth. I’m not going to waffle one way or the other. I’m going to be straightforward and tell them the truth.\nGordon Dill: (18:04)\nSpeaking of the rules, let’s talk about criminal justice. I want to read something you posted on Twitter. You wrote, “Just as slavery was ended, we can end the epidemic of police brutality in this country and root out the systemic racism that oppresses communities of color across South Carolina.” Are you saying police brutality is as pervasive in the South as slavery once was? And if you’re suggesting a legislative solution to end police brutality, exactly what is it?\nJamie Harrison: (18:31)\nLet me tell you. I grew up in Orangeburg, South Carolina. And one of the very first stories that I heard as I started learning more about the civil rights movement and what went on in my hometown was about the Orangeburg Massacre. When three college students who were protesting a segregated, bowling alley, and a bunch of other kids on the campuses of both South Carolina State and Claflin University were protesting because they wanted to desegregate that bowling alley, and they went marching. And three of those students lost their lives that night. None of them had guns. None of them had weapons, but they were marching for equality. And they were killed by members of law enforcement. Now, those members of law enforcement actually went to trial, but nobody went to jail. Nobody did. So imagine growing up in a community where that is the legacy. Imagine being an African-American man who’s has heard all his life the horror stories about how folks have been brutalized and beaten and how the criminal justice system hasn’t been fair and not just. That’s the reality of so many people in this state.\nJamie Harrison: (19:44)\nIs that saying that all police are bad? No. I have police officers in my family. My grandpa, Ron, on my stepdad’s side had been in the police force over 30 years. I’ve talked to him. We all feared about him leaving each day and coming back home at night. But what we’re seeing is there’s some bad apples in the system that need to be rooted out, that we need to bring accountability to the system so that every community, whether it’s a black community, a white community, or Latino community, every community can feel as though their police are there to protect and serve them. And that’s what we need to do.\nGordon Dill: (20:18)\nAnd what is your legislative solution?\nJamie Harrison: (20:19)\nWell, part of the solution is coming up with a register so that we know of those bad police officers, so that somebody who commits atrocities in Chicago can’t come down to Spartanburg County and get a job as a deputy sheriff. Some of that is getting rid of … Having a national force of standard, a standard of force, so that we know, whether you are in Chicago or whether you are in South Carolina, we know what the standards are in terms of how you use force and what type of force that you can use. Some of that is let’s demilitarize our police so that we can rebuild the faith between our communities and the police officers.\nJamie Harrison: (21:01)\nWe understand the importance of policing. And I don’t believe in this trend of defunding the police. I don’t believe in that because police have such an important role in our communities. But what I do believe is bringing more accountability into that system in order to make sure that folks have trust, that when they call on the police officers, they don’t have to worry about whether or not they’re going to have their lives.\nGordon Dill: (21:25)\nAll right. Thank you. Carolyn.\nCarolyn Murray: (21:26)\nThank you. Mr. Harrison, we are continuing our discussion about civil unrest. Social change in this country has come about when women and racial and ethnic minorities have marched and protested. We’ve certainly seen that a lot this past year. Describe legislation that you would push forward to ensure the rights of organizations are met. And have you met with members of the Black Lives Matter movement, and what kind of legislation have they described they want, and what have they expressed as their concerns?\nJamie Harrison: (21:57)\nYeah. I know folks in the Black Lives Matter movement. I have not met officially with anybody in terms of the organization. And I know a number of the folks in the movement here in South Carolina. And many of them-\nCarolyn Murray: (22:08)\nWhy have you not met with them?\nJamie Harrison: (22:11)\nThey haven’t asked for me.\nCarolyn Murray: (22:12)\nDid you feel it was important to reach out to them because their presence has been so visible this year?\nJamie Harrison: (22:20)\nWell, many of the folks here in South Carolina that are involved, I know personally and we’ve worked together on other things. And what they’re pushing for is, again, I don’t believe in the defunding the police effort. But I do believe in strengthening the relationship between the police and the communities, more community-based policing, making sure that we also bring in other professionals that can help alleviate some of the pressure and some of the tension, bringing in psychologists, bringing in drug addiction counselors and those types of folks to help address the situations in our communities. And I think that’s really, really important. I’ve also talked with a few members in the police forces about things that they believe can work as well. And so, I believe I can be one of those people that will bring both our policing forces and our community organizations together to sit at a table and come up with solutions that work for South Carolina.\nCarolyn Murray: (23:25)\nThank you, Mr. Harrison.\nJamie Harrison: (23:25)\nThank you.\nCarolyn Murray: (23:25)\nGordon.\nGordon Dill: (23:26)\nSo if the Supreme Court were to strike down the Affordable Care Act, what exactly is the plan to replace it?\nJamie Harrison: (23:32)\nWell, if I’m in the United States Senate, we are going to find a way to replace it because if the Supreme Court does strike down the ACA, that means in the midst of a pandemic that is only going to get worse between now because we’re in flu season as well, and we are seeing spikes. Dr. Fauci said yesterday, he wants 10,000 new cases a day, but we’re seeing 40,000 new cases a day in this country. So we’re in the midst of a pandemic and Lindsey Graham supports the court to strike this down. The question is, what are we going to do then, for those 23 million people who do not have health care? We’re going to have to find some way to make sure that happens or otherwise, we are going to create even a greater pandemic and a greater tragedy and crisis in this country.\nJamie Harrison: (24:18)\nAgain, I believe in the ACA. I believe coming up, using it as a public option, strengthening it by including mental, and vision, and dental health as well. But we will be in a fix as a nation if that law is struck down by the Supreme Court. And it said that Lindsey Graham supports that effort.\nGordon Dill: (24:38)\nAll right. Thank you. We have one minute left. Carolyn.\nCarolyn Murray: (24:40)\nGordon, thank you. Mr. Harrison, sorry that we are short on time, but we would like you to answer the question about your concerns and of restrictions on abortions. Describe what you believe are appropriate restrictions on abortions.\nJamie Harrison: (24:54)\nWell, for me, I’m pro-choice. But in the end of the day, I believe the issue of abortion is a hard issue. It’s a difficult issue. It’s one that we … It’s a painful one to even think about and talk about. But in the end of the day, I believe it’s between a woman, her doctor, and her God. I don’t believe politicians have a role in that. And I’m a firm believer in that. Now, what we can have a role in is making sure we address some of these issues that are impacting women and the health of their babies. The infant mortality rate here in South Carolina is in the top 10. The fact that I stated earlier that 14 of our 46 counties had no OB/GYNs, that we have a Senator who has is proposing a healthcare system-\nCarolyn Murray: (25:39)\nThank you very much.\nJamie Harrison: (25:39)\nOh, sorry.\nCarolyn Murray: (25:40)\nThank you, Mr. Harrison. We appreciate your time.\nJamie Harrison: (25:41)\nOne minute. I’m sorry.\nCarolyn Murray: (25:42)\nThank you.\nGordon Dill: (25:42)\nWe did want to give you the promised one minute for a closing statement.\nJamie Harrison: (25:46)\nWell, thank you all for doing this again, and I wish you and your families all health and for all of yours here today. Listen, in the end of this campaign as I’ve been saying, I’ve lived the American dream. I grew up in a mobile home and I’m now running for United States Senate. That only happens in America. Our state motto, “While I breathe, I hope,” is my life. It’s the motto of my life. But what I want in this campaign, and what I hope is, that I’ve inspired folks. Lindsey Graham is going to scare you. He’s going to scare you about crime. He’s going to scare you about everything. But we’re tired of being scared in this country. We are tired of being scared in this state. It’s time for us to come together as a people. And I hope through my campaign, a campaign that is built on hope that folks will see that and say that it’s time for a new day.\nAmy Wood: (26:35)\nMr. Harrison, thank you again for joining us tonight. We appreciate it. Keep it here. Don’t move. We have more to come. We will speak with Senator Lindsey Graham when we come back right after a short break.\nSpeaker 2: (26:45)\nIt’s one of the country’s most important Senate races. Incumbent Lindsey Graham-\nLindsey Graham: (26:49)\nI’m going to be being focused on the needs of the United States.\nSpeaker 2: (26:52)\n… and challenger, Jamie Harrison.\nJamie Harrison: (26:54)\nI’ll fight for you as hard as I would for my family.\nSpeaker 2: (26:57)\nTonight, a live discussion on the issues important to you, the pandemic, the economy, education. From your local election headquarters, the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce and Nexstar media, the US Senate Race, South Carolina, a live candidate conversation.\nAmy Wood: (27:16)\nAnd once again, good evening and thank you for joining us. We are coming to you live from the WSPA TV studios in Spartanburg, South Carolina. I’m Amy Wood, evening anchor here at WSPA. Tonight’s conversation will be live-streamed and broadcast on our Nexstar network across the Carolinas, as well as our partner station WLTX in Columbia. Many of you tuned in this evening to watch the candidates for US Senate in their second debate. Both campaigns agreed to the format of that debate. This week, campaign staff for Democratic challenger Jamie Harrison asked that incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham take a COVID test. The Senator was tested last Friday. In a statement released yesterday afternoon, the Harrison campaign wrote, “I cannot responsibly debate in person tomorrow night and allow politics to put my family, my campaign-\nAmy Wood: (28:03)\n… person tomorrow night and allow politics to put my family, my campaign staff, Senator Graham’s staff, and members of the media at unnecessary risk. The Graham campaign responded. “Mr. Harrison is demanding special treatment. If Mr. Harrison is not able to interact with South Carolinians on the same terms that they live their lives, he should not be their Senator.” Now because of this impasse, we have changed the format for this forum tonight. At the top of the hour, Mr. Harrison joined us for half an hour of uninterrupted questions from our panel. Now, Senator Graham will face that same panel with equal time. WSPA and Nexstar Media have taken steps to provide a safe environment tonight. The environment has been sanitized and the candidates and our panel are separated at a safe distance. Now let’s meet that panel. WCBD from Charleston, Anchor Carolyn Murray, and WSPA Anchor Gordon Dill. Gordon will ask the first question.\nGordon Dill: (28:57)\nAll right, Amy. Thank you. And good evening, Senator. Thank you for being here. Starting on Monday, you will chair a committee to confirm a new Supreme Court justice. You’ll be inside a hearing room for hours at a time, several days of the week, with some of America’s top elected leadership. Is it not appropriate for you to take a coronavirus test in advance of that hearing?\nLindsey Graham: (29:20)\nWell, number one, I am the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that’s about to confirm the most highly qualified woman I think ever nominated by the Republican party. I’m extremely proud of it. We’re setting the hearing room up based on CDC guidelines. I just got a statement today from the architect of the Capitol who consulted with the House physician saying that the room is set up in a compliant way. But here’s what’s important. How many of you are going to go to work tomorrow? How many of you will be around people tomorrow? If you’re a waitress and you go to the restaurant to earn your living, are you going to require of your employer that everybody be tested that comes into the restaurant? Are you going to require that all your coworkers be tested whether they need to or not? You can’t make that requirement. If you did, it would break our economy.\nLindsey Graham: (30:08)\nSo we’re going to run the hearing in a medically compliant way, but I’m not going to live my life differently than you have to live yours. To those of you who work for a living, you can’t do what Mr. Harrison has demanded tonight. You can’t not show up at work because you want everybody tested whether they need to or not. I’ve got a letter from my doctor saying that I am CDC compliant, there’s no reason to test me. So this is not about testing. This is about political accountability. And the great loss tonight was a debate. I do a lot of interviews.\nLindsey Graham: (30:40)\nI was looking forward to debating Mr. Harrison about would you vote for Amy Barrett? She’s highly qualified. I voted for Sotomayer and Kagan, nominees presented to the Senate by Barack Obama. I saw in them qualified women that I would not have chosen, but understood President Obama had that right. Mr. Harrison, when it came time for President Trump to nominate Neil Gorsuch, highly qualified, joined into the effort to filibuster that nomination. Mr. Harrison said, “Bring out the cots.” He joined in with Chuck Schumer to engage in the first partisan filibuster in the history of the United States Senate. The rules changed under Schumer and Reid, not me. I voted against changing the rules, had to change them for Justice Gorsuch.\nLindsey Graham: (31:25)\nBut here’s the last thing about judges. I voted for Sotomayer and Kagan and everybody applauded, every liberal in the country. Oh, “We love Lindsey Graham.” Then I watched the destruction of Brett Kavanaugh, one of the most decent people I’ve known in my entire life. I stood up and stood by him. Now there’s $50 million coming in in the last three months alone to take me out. I stood up for Kavanaugh. I got in the way of destroying his life. And Mr. Harrison cheered on the destruction of Brett Kavanaugh. I voted for Democratic judicial nominees. He joined Schumer in opposing Trump nominees. And I guarantee there’s no way in God’s green earth he’d ever vote for Barrett. And that’s important to the voters of South Carolina. If you’re looking for somebody to support conservative judges, I’m your guy. If you’re looking for somebody to reach across the aisle, I have done it.\nGordon Dill: (32:14)\nLet’s ask about that confirmation process. I do want to play a piece of sound, a recording from something you said a short time ago, if we can play that.\nLindsey Graham: (32:25)\nIf an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.\nGordon Dill: (32:35)\nYou said that, Senator, in 2018. The question is, how do people know the things you’re saying tonight won’t change when it is politically convenient for you or your party?\nLindsey Graham: (32:46)\nWell, Gordon, I appreciate that question. In January 2019, I was asked, after the Kavanaugh debacle, what would you do if there’s an opening? I said I would see what the market will bear. And August of this year, I was asked by NBC, “If there’s an opening on the Supreme Court, what would you do?” We’ll see what the market bears. I am going to lead the charge to confirm Judge Amy Barrett the court. And I can tell you this. If Chuck Schumer and Democrats were in charge, they’d be doing the same thing. We’ve had 19 nominations in an election year. 17 of the 19 have been confirmed when the president is of the same party as the Senate.\nLindsey Graham: (33:26)\nHere’s the thing for me. When it comes to Democratic judges, I gave them a fair shake and I voted for them. When it comes to Republican judges, my Democratic colleagues want to destroy them. Thomas, Bork, Alito, now Kavanaugh. I am hoping that this hearing doesn’t turn into the Kavanaugh debacle. I’m hoping that Amy Barrett gets treated with respect the way I treated Sotomayer and Kagan. We’re moving forward. We’re doing nothing unusual here in terms of how the Senate operates.\nGordon Dill: (33:55)\nAll right. Thank you. Carolyn. Thank you, Gordon.\nCarolyn Murray: (33:58)\nSenator, thank you for being with us tonight. We appreciate your time. Senator, the White House has been described as a coronavirus hotspot, dozens of people associated with the president’s campaign have tested positive for COVID-19. And many of those people were seen at large gatherings and they were not wearing masks. So my question to you is do you believe in a national mask mandate?\nLindsey Graham: (34:21)\nI believe that everybody should wear a mask, you should wash your hands, and you should socially distance. This is a deadly disease.\nCarolyn Murray: (34:29)\nAnd do you believe there should be a national mask mandate?\nLindsey Graham: (34:33)\nI don’t know how you enforce it. Who enforces it? Does the FBI follow us all around? I believe in responsibility. So the idea of wearing a mask, count me in. In terms of a national mandate, I don’t know how that works. But if you’re looking for my advice, wear a mask, wash your hands. We will get through this. A vaccine, I think, is near. The drug therapies that got President Trump back on his feet are going to be available to all of us. I’m encouraged by the fact that we will defeat this virus sooner rather than later.\nLindsey Graham: (35:06)\nBut this election is not about just the virus. What happens if the Democrats take over the Senate, they get the House and the White House? The most radical political agenda in American history comes our way. Is there a difference between the Democratic and Republican party? Absolutely. Is bipartisanship good? Yes. But let me tell you a big difference in this race. If the Republican party can hold the Senate, I’m in line to be the budget chairman. If the Democratic party takes back the Senate, the budget chairman will be Bernie Sanders. So I want you to understand what I just said. If the Democrats take over the Senate an avowed socialist, Bernie Sanders, will be writing the budget for the United States. If the Republican party keeps the Senate and I’m in it, I’ll be the budget chairman. There’s a big difference between me and Bernie Sanders when it comes to your money. Vote for me.\nCarolyn Murray: (36:01)\nThank you, Senator. We appreciate it. Gordon.\nGordon Dill: (36:03)\nYeah, we do want to stay on this topic of COVID though. We may have heard your opponent say he would consider requiring students returning to class to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Is that something you would support?\nLindsey Graham: (36:16)\nIf we get a vaccine, I’ll be the first one to take it once it’s FDA approved. But my job is to be a Senator for our state. In Washington, to be our voice in Washington, we have a superintendent of education, Molly Spearman, who I trust. We have a governor who I trust and I like. So when it comes to COVID, let’s push as hard as we can to get a vaccine to get this virus behind us. It has been deadly. It has been tough on our economy. I want another stimulus package. I think we need another $1,200 per person to help. I want money-\nGordon Dill: (36:51)\nSenator, we’re planning to ask you about the stimulus package. In fact, it’s-\nLindsey Graham: (36:55)\nAs far as the vaccine-\nGordon Dill: (36:56)\nAbout the vaccine, should it be required for students returning to school?\nLindsey Graham: (37:00)\nI think that’s up to South Carolina. I think that’s up to the people of South Carolina. I’m not running for governor. I’m running for United States Senate. I understand the 10th amendment. I trust Molly Spearman. She won the right to make education policy. I am trying to win the right to make national security policy, to make economic policy at the national level, to reject the largest tax increase in American history if my Democratic colleagues take over the House and Senate and the White House. They’re going to change America as we know it today. They’re going to expand the court beyond nine to pack it with liberals just as sure as I’m sitting here. They’re going to do away the electoral college. Now, what does that mean to us, Gordon? Well, our voice is lost. You pick the president based on New York and California. Our founding fathers wanted states like South Carolina to have a voice. So the difference between the agendas is incredibly important. Bernie Sanders as budget chairman versus Lindsey Graham. I can go on and on. Liberal judges versus conservative judges.\nGordon Dill: (37:59)\nAll right, thank you. Carolyn.\nCarolyn Murray: (38:00)\nGordon, Senator Graham, just this week, negotiations broke down to provide a second round of relief to families and businesses impacted because of the coronavirus. Well, now that that first round has expired, a lot of people are losing jobs, they’re losing their healthcare, they’re losing their homes. You were talking about providing relief. How will you do that? How will you reach across the aisle to ensure bipartisan support to help families who are struggling and desperate for relief right now?\nLindsey Graham: (38:32)\nBy voting for a package that will make a difference. I voted for phase three. It passed the Senate unanimously. It was a trillion dollars. I’m willing to do almost two trillion. I want the money to help the problem. The Chamber is one of the sponsors of what would have been a debate, now is a conversation. My family ran a restaurant, a liquor store, a bar, and a pool room in central South Carolina. I grew up in the back. What a great country. You can go from the back of the bar to being a Senator. But I want to give liability protection to every business in South Carolina who plays by the rules. If you’ll do what’s required of your business, I don’t want you to be sued because of COVID.\nLindsey Graham: (39:13)\nMy Democratic colleagues will not agree with that. I’m for a $1,200 check. I’m for hundreds of billions of dollars to help our schools safely allow our kids to go back. I’m for PPP. I just got back from Myrtle Beach in Charleston. The tourism industry is on its back. It was a tough summer. Nobody’s traveling now. The golf courses are not being run at all. The hotels, occupancy is down. Another round of loans for businesses that are struggling, count me in. I just talked to the president at lunch. I’ve been on the phone with Secretary Mnuchin. I am excited that Pelosi and Mnuchin are talking again. Count me in for another stimulus package, but we have to have liability protection so our businesses are not sued out of existence.\nCarolyn Murray: (39:56)\nThank you, Senator. Gordon.\nGordon Dill: (39:58)\nOur next topic, Senator, is criminal justice. In the debate last week, you said you did not believe there was systemic racism in our law enforcement. So the question is, as a Congress, what legislation can protect Americans from police brutality?\nLindsey Graham: (40:14)\nSo, number one, let me say this. Reform the police, yes. What happened to Mr. Floyd was wrong and people should pay a price. But what’s happening in America and all over the country is a war on the police itself. There are some bad cops out there. I’ve been a prosecutor, I’ve been a defense attorney, I’ve been a military judge. Count me in the camp of reforming the police, but having the cops’ back. I’ve been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of the Police because they see in me an ally. I voted for criminal justice reform to make sure that African-American males and Hispanic males mostly who’ve been sentenced to long times in jail for nonviolent offenses can get a second chance. Tim Scott, my dear friend and partner here in South Carolina, produced a police reform bill that was bi-partisan and Chuck Schumer stopped it from coming to the floor.\nLindsey Graham: (41:08)\nThey said no to Tim Scott’s effort to find a solution to police reform, transparency, more money for diversity, hiring more minority police officers. It was stopped because they want the issue, they don’t want to solve the problem. That breaks my heart. And Jamie Harrison, my opponent, supported the Nancy Pelosi version of police reform and said no to the Tim Scott version of police reform. He will pick Pelosi over Tim Scott every time. He will go with Schumer when it comes to judges. And that’s what’s on the ballot here, folks. Count me in for reforming the police. Tim Scott had a plan that was blocked by Democrats. The Nancy Pelosi plan will cripple the police. So Mr. Harrison had a chance to weigh in and be bi-partisan. He chose Pelosi over Tim Scott. I did not.\nGordon Dill: (41:57)\nThank you, sir. Carolyn.\nCarolyn Murray: (41:59)\nSenator Graham, our next subject is the issue of civil unrest in this-\nCarolyn Murray: (42:03)\n… Graham, our next subject is the issue of civil unrest in this country. Social change in this country has come about when women and racial minorities have marched and protested. Sometimes that’s resulted in rioting. Certainly, no one supports lawlessness. You have said in the past that you support Black Lives Matter. Have you met with members of that organization, first of all?\nLindsey Graham: (42:25)\nI met with pastors, I met with people in the African American community, and here are the facts, that I believe our cops are systemically racist, no doubt, I believe that South Carolina is a racist state. Now, let me tell you why. To young people out there of color, to young immigrants, this is a great state. The one thing I can say without any doubt, you can be an African American and go to the Senate. You just have to share the values of our state. Tim Scott is in the Senate. He’s the only African American Republican in the country. Nikki Haley is a daughter of Indian immigrants raised in Denmark, South Carolina. She became a governor. In South Carolina, folks, it’s not about the color of your skin or where you came from. It’s about your ideas.\nLindsey Graham: (43:08)\nThe reason I’m going to win this race is because my ideas, my conservative philosophy, my willingness to reach across the aisle fits our state. I am in line with Tim Scott and Nikki Haley. My opponent’s going to lose not because of race, but because he’s aligned with the most liberal people in the country. He’s raising $50 million from liberals all over the country to flip this state into the democratic column. It’s not going to work.\nLindsey Graham: (43:34)\nCount me in for reforming the police. I voted for the First Step Act that gave African American males and Hispanic males who’ve been in prison under the Joe Biden “three strikes, you’re out” bill. President Trump led the way. I worked with Cory Booker. There are a lot of people getting out of jail who were sentenced to long terms in jail for nonviolent offenses. They can go back to their families. They can get a job.\nLindsey Graham: (43:57)\n31% of our state is African American. I’m asking to every African-American out there, look at my record. I’ve been supporting, historically, black colleges and universities, and I’m glad president Trump has made it a permanent fixture. Now we don’t have to beg every year for the money. I care about everybody. If you’re a young African American, an immigrant, you can go anywhere in this state. You just need to be conservative, not liberal.\nCarolyn Murray: (44:23)\nMr. Senator Graham, I would just like to talk about that a little bit more, if you could explain yourself. You say that you don’t believe that there is systemic racism, but you named two people who are elected officials, former Governor Nikki Haley, as well as Senator Tim Scott. Do you think that there is a problem that you’re still able to only name so few people of color when it comes to people who’ve had marked success in their careers, in their lives-\nLindsey Graham: (44:50)\nHere’s what-\nCarolyn Murray: (44:50)\n… that perhaps there is a problem-\nLindsey Graham: (44:52)\nYes, ma’am.\nCarolyn Murray: (44:53)\n… when you can only name so few?\nLindsey Graham: (44:54)\nHere’s the problem. I think naming Nikki Haley and Tim Scott, our national leaders in the Republican Party, I consider this a proud moment for South Carolina, not just for the Republican Party. Tim Scott has tried to reform the police. Tim Scott gets called names you would not believe. All I can say when it comes to South Carolina, you don’t have to take my word for it, you can go as far as you want to go if you have values associated with our state.\nLindsey Graham: (45:24)\nHere’s the problem. Tim Scott’s been stopped six or seven times on Capitol Hill by the police. I never have, and I want to deal with that. I want more police officers from the community. I want to make sure that we have transparency in policing. I want more body cameras. I want to recruit more people. I want to involve deescalation training. I want the police to be well-equipped to deal with the problems they have, but you have no idea what it’s like to be a cop now.\nLindsey Graham: (45:58)\nI’ve talked to the police officers all over the state. They feel abandoned. They feel like they’re the bad guy. I am not going to be part of that movement. I am not going to empower what I think is an assault on law and order with me. You will get reformed, but I’m not going to abandon the cops. With me, I will stand up to the mobs.\nCarolyn Murray: (46:17)\nSenator Graham, thank you. We’d like you to take a look at a video question. This question regards the rights of LGBTQ. Take a listen.\nLouis Yuhasz: (46:27)\nHey, I’m Louis Yuhasz, and I have a question for the candidates. My partner and I have been married for five years, and we’ve been together for 22. What will the candidates do to ensure our rights are protected, the rights of gay people married in the State of South Carolina?\nLindsey Graham: (46:45)\nGood question. The law of the land by the Supreme Court is that same-sex marriage is now legal. I accept that. I accept that ruling. We’re a conservative state. There are a lot of religious people around this state who believe in traditional marriage. They’re not bigots. They’re not Neanderthals for believing in that, but this man under our law has a right to his relationship. I will honor the law of the land. I have tried to be tolerant. I’ve tried to understand that people have different life experiences. I do. I’m not a woman. I’m not a person of color. I listen, but I can tell you right now when it comes to South Carolina, I think I’ve been an effective voice for who we are, and to the gentlemen, the law of the land is that same-sex marriage is legal, and we will honor that.\nCarolyn Murray: (47:32)\nThank you, senator. [crosstalk 00:47:34]-\nGordon Dill: (47:34)\nLet’s talk about the Affordable Care Act, senator. If the Supreme Court is to strike down the ACA, Republicans have promised for years to repeal and replace. Where is the replace?\nLindsey Graham: (47:46)\nIt’s Graham-Cassidy. Can I talk to you a little bit about Obamacare? Obamacare in South Carolina has been a disaster. You were promised if you like your doctor, you can keep it. We had five choices under Obamacare. We’re down to one. Premiums have gone up 30%. For a while, I was on Obamacare. My premiums went up 300%. My coverage almost was non-existent.\nLindsey Graham: (48:06)\nObamacare, three states get 35% of Obamacare dollars. They’re California, New York, and Massachusetts. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren. They’re 22% of the population. What would I like to do? I’d like to make sure that if you’re in Spartanburg, you get the same amount of money from the federal government is if you lived in San Francisco. That would be a almost a billion dollar increase for us. Level out the funding, send the money to the state directly, bypass the Washington bureaucrat you’ll never meet, put our local officials in charge of healthcare, allow our doctors and hospitals to talk with you, the patient, in your own backyard.\nLindsey Graham: (48:44)\nThe reason liberals hate my idea is because I’m trying to get money and power out of Washington back here at home. Their goal of single-payer healthcare, I think, will reduce quality, increase cost. My goal with Obamacare is to make sure we don’t send a billion dollars to New York, California, Massachusetts. We control the money, and we make the decision.\nGordon Dill: (49:03)\nThere’s 150,000 South Carolinians with a confirmed case of COVID. That’s a preexisting condition. They may lose the ability to buy healthcare without ACA.\nLindsey Graham: (49:13)\nAbsolutely. Look at Graham-Cassidy. We send the money back to South Carolina, we get almost a billion dollars more under my bill than Obamacare gives us. We get to manage the money here at home. Local politicians are in charge. If you don’t like what they’re doing, you can vote them out. A bureaucrat in Washington could care less about us. Pre-existing conditions is required under the Graham-Cassidy bill.\nLindsey Graham: (49:36)\nMy mom died when I was 21. My dad died when I was 22. We went broke because we were under-insured. When my parents died, my sister was 13. We got a Social Security survivor benefit check of about 300 bucks for my sister, Darlene. We moved in with an aunt and uncle that worked in the textile mills in South Carolina and never made it over 25 or $30,000. I get it. We’re all one car wreck away from needing help.\nLindsey Graham: (50:01)\nWe’re not going to take your pre-existing conditions away from anybody. That makes no sense. What I’m trying to do is get the money and the power out of Washington back here at home because our liberal friends are going to put all of our healthcare under the federal government umbrella.\nCarolyn Murray: (50:17)\n[crosstalk 00:50:17].\nLindsey Graham: (50:17)\nThat is not the way to go, folks.\nGordon Dill: (50:19)\nThank you, senator. Carolyn?\nCarolyn Murray: (50:20)\nSenator Graham, marijuana is still illegal at the federal level for all Americans. Do you support changes to federal marijuana laws, including legalization, decriminalization, as well as medicinal use? We’re trying to get into a few more questions if you could make your own question as brief as possible.\nLindsey Graham: (50:36)\nNo, ma’am, I do not. I’ve been a prosecutor, defense attorney, and a judge. Marijuana can be a very dangerous drug, particularly for young people, but I do support medical marijuana. I am convinced that there are medical purposes associated with marijuana, and I’d be willing to make that exception.\nCarolyn Murray: (50:52)\nDespite the fact that 70% Americans say that they’ve used marijuana, there are polls that show that people believe that marijuana could and should be used for recreational use?\nLindsey Graham: (51:03)\nI’m in the 30% that says it’s not a good idea. I’ve seen the effects. It’s a gateway drug to other things. When it comes to medical marijuana, it makes sense. When it comes to legalization, I’m not going to impose that on the people of South Carolina.\nGordon Dill: (51:16)\nWe only have a minute before we get to your closing here, so quickly, there has been some criticism from the president about mail-in absentee ballots, whether they will be safe or not. Your voters, do you encourage them to vote by mail?\nLindsey Graham: (51:29)\nYes. If you want to vote by mail, do it. Call up, let them know you want to absentee ballot. There’ll be a record of the transaction, but voting by mail where everybody in the country gets a ballot whether you want one or not is a disaster. In Minneapolis, they had a guy with 300-something ballots in his car. Voting by mail in South Carolina is safe. Absentee voting is safe in South Carolina. There’s a record here. I want a fair election. I want everybody to vote, but this idea, that liberal dream of just mailing out ballots and hope people get it, about harvesting, I think is a threat to our democracy.\nGordon Dill: (52:03)\nThank you, senator.\nCarolyn Murray: (52:03)\nAll right, one final question, and certainly, this was something that was certainly a compelling time in our community. Nine members of Emanuel AME Church were gunned down by a gunman who was able to purchase a gun because of the Charleston loophole. I apologize. We are out of time. Thank you so much, Senator Graham, for being with us.\nGordon Dill: (52:23)\nWe did promise you one minute as a closing statement. Go ahead.\nLindsey Graham: (52:27)\nBig choice, election. Mr. Harrison is the associate chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He’s a great spokesman for their cause. I’m a conservative Republican who reaches across the aisle with a record to prove it. I’m the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I will fight for conservative judges. A lot’s on the ballot, law and order versus the mob and chaos, conservative judges versus liberal judges, free enterprise versus Bernie Sanders being in charge of your budget. I love South Carolina. It is my home. It is the best place in the world to raise children and to start a business as long. As I’m your Senator, I intend to keep it that way.\nAmy Wood: (53:12)\nAll right. Thank you so much, Senator Graham, for being with us tonight in Spartanburg. A reminder, absentee voting is underway across the state of South Carolina. Thanks for watching and have a good night.\nSpeaker 3: (53:23)\nAll right, that is going to conclude this candidate forum coming your way from the studios of WSPA in Spartanburg. Both Jaime Harrison, the challenger, and the incumbent Lindsey Graham given a number of questions over the last hour or so. First question for both candidates tonight was about the virus, Jaime Harrison saying he supports the national mask mandate while Lindsey Graham says everybody should be wearing a mask, but it would be hard to enforce some sort of national mask mandate.\nSpeaker 3: (53:55)\nWhen it came to the subject of a vaccine, Jaime Harrison said if the health expert said to take it, he would, but not as Senator Graham said to do so. Senator Graham simply said that a vaccine is near closer than we think right now. Harrison was also asked about the Supreme Court hearing coming up on Monday, was asked if Amy Coney Barrett was qualified for the Supreme Court. He really didn’t give an answer on that per se. He didn’t say if she was qualified for that position. Senator Graham says he is leading next week’s confirmation hearing. It will meet CDC guidelines, and he will lead the charge to confirm Amy Coney Barrett.\nSpeaker 3: (54:34)\nAs far as police reform in the United States is concerned, Harrison saying that not all cops are bad and Senator Graham echoing that as well saying that he’s talked with some cops who say they feel abandoned. Harrison says he has not met with members of Black Lives Matter but he said he knows members of that as far as the civil unrest in our country is concerned and their efforts. As far as the senator is concerned, he also has not met with any members of Black Lives Matter, but he said he doesn’t believe that South Carolina is a racist state. We’ll have a complete wrap-up of this coming up later tonight on News 19 at 11:00.",

         "Joe Biden: (00:00)\nI’ll tell you. And I asked her, “Is that my sister?” I said, “Yeah, yeah.” Look, the thing I love about being here, and it’s been about a year since September I was here last at this very spot, is the one thing we have in common. I mean, this sincerely. I first ran for the United States Senate years ago and I had one billboard. It said, “For all our families.” For real, that’s all it said. All my literature, “For all our families.” And the thing I love about you all, it’s all about family. It’s about family. It’s about family and faith and loyalty, and that’s what I think every time I think you here. And so I want to thank you.\nJoe Biden: (00:43)\nNow, I’ll tell you what, Edgar planned on bringing in 20 horses in here, but he couldn’t get them in today. Tell you what, I’ve had people campaign for me but never had them go through the neighbors with me on horses. But my dad, who was a real equestrian, would have really been flattered to know you’re doing this. Folks, look, it’s great to be back at the center and I don’t have to tell you all, there’s so much at stake. And here we are, we’ve gone through so much since I was here last, because of the incompetence of this administration. 210,000 people dead. We’re in a situation where that’s 40,000 Latinos nationwide, 40,000. 30 million people lost their jobs. Three million Latinos lost their jobs. One in three Latino businesses have closed, and the deep racial injustices that Trump continues to fan the flames of. It’s just wrong. We have to end this cycle where in good times, you’re being left behind. In bad times, you’re the first in trouble, and as we come out, always the last to come out.\nJoe Biden: (01:56)\nThis crisis, we have I think though an enormous opportunity to build back better. I’m going to be very short, so I’m not going to keep you standing very long. Don’t worry. But I really feel strongly about this. I think we’re in a circumstance where you all understand it, but the American public is beginning to understand it. You are the core of the American story. You have a potential. You’re already an economic powerhouse, but the potential to lead the country in the 21st century into the direction that we need to go. You have close to 20% of the population in the United States, 24 out of every 100 kids in grade school through high school are Latino, and it’s ridiculous that we continue to policies that this administration has moved forward on and not embrace that and see it as our future. I’m not trying to be solicitous with it. I’m not trying to be nice. You are the future of the country. I mean, you really are.\nJoe Biden: (02:54)\nIf, in fact, we’re in a situation where the Latino community in the United States of America and the GDP, the wealth that they generate nationwide, if we just took just the Latino population, you’d be the eighth largest economy in the world, in the United States. Why can’t we see that the future is just absolutely breathtaking if we just use our heads and begin to operate in a way that I think the American people are ready to do? The blinders have been taken off the American people. They get it. They understand. They understand that all those folks in the front lines, look at how many dreamers are out there risking their lives? I mean, you know it, but the American people don’t know it, and I keep telling them all over the country. The dreamers, there’s thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of them risking their lives, making sure that people are staying alive, they can stay home.\nJoe Biden: (03:53)\nAnd so, folks, look, we’re going to be in a situation where we can’t make this, we can’t do it without you all. We cannot win without the community. And I’m going to say something somewhat self-serving about you all. The fact is you can determine the outcome of this election, not just, not just for President, but for the Senate, for the Congress. And that’s the biggest mark, the single most consequential thing anyone can do is vote. And when you vote and they add it up and they see who delivered the vote, that’s the thing that guarantees significant input on what happens next. So folks, early voting starts. The clock is ticking. Voting starts here in just eight days on the 17th and I’d encourage you to tell all your friends. Go to Iwillvote.com now. Make sure they’re registered, their addresses are up to date on the ballot, and they have a plan to vote in the early voting right here, right at this spot.\nJoe Biden: (05:03)\nSo come back next weekend, bring your family, and bring five friends. I really mean it. Bring other people with you, because he’s trying to scare us. He’s trying to convince everybody there’s ways they can play with the vote and undermine the vote. They can’t. If we show up, we win. And look what’s happened in early voting all across America. Long lines, long lines. We can’t just win, we have to win overwhelmingly, so he can’t be in a position where you can put the phony challenges that he’s talking about. So, folks, the American people, they’re the ones who decide our future, not this President and Attorney General, who is less than straightforward. You’re the ones. So let’s get out and vote. I know the sun is hot. I don’t want to keep you standing. And I want to thank the elected officials. This we call a bus man’s holiday. That means when a bus man has a holiday, he has the day off, the guy driving, he doesn’t get back on the bus.\nJoe Biden: (06:05)\nWell, these folks are all on the bus. They’re elected officials. They’re another elected official. I can’t thank you enough for your support. I give you my word I will do everything in my power to deliver on all that I’ve said. I mean it from my heart. You are family. Family and faith are what’s driven this community and is going to drive this country. And so, folks, let’s go get them. This is off. I guess I should have stayed where I was. My grand pop was not Hispanic. He was an Irishman. And every time I’d walk out of his door up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he’d say, “Joey, keep the faith.” My grand mum, when she was alive, would yell, “No, Joey. Spread it!” Let’s go spread the faith, okay? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, I promise you, if I win, you’re getting an invitation to Washington, okay? Not a joke, not a joke. Thank you. You’re the best.",

         "Sean Hannity: (00:00)\n… [inaudible 00:00:00] radio host. Thank you, Mark. Joining us now live from the White House, President Donald Trump. Mr. President, thank you for being with us. First, an obvious question, how are you feeling? How’s the First Lady feeling? And I want to get into your comments that you would make Regeneron and therapeutics free for the American people. But first, how are you doing?\nPresident Donald Trump: (00:20)\nReally good, and First Lady is doing really good. I thought Mark was fantastic, and I love your show.\nSean Hannity: (00:29)\nOkay, I’ll take it. Have you been tested since? Your campaign and your doctor, Sean Conley put out that you’ll be medically safe and cleared for safe return to public engagements by Saturday, five full days. Have you been tested recently?\nPresident Donald Trump: (00:51)\nYeah, I just saw the doctors today. They think I’m in great shape. I’m in great shape. I know I’m in good shape [crosstalk 00:00:54].\nSean Hannity: (00:53)\nDid you test negative?\nPresident Donald Trump: (00:55)\nAnd I’ll tell you, I took this Regeneron. It’s phenomenal. Eli Lilly has something very comparable. It’s phenomenal. It’s a whole new day. It’s all… If you go back a few months, nobody ever even thought about this stuff. We came up with it, and I’m going to have it delivered to every hospital we have sick people with the COVID, or the China Virus as we call it, and we’re going to make people better. It actually made me better. I went in, I could have left a day later.\nPresident Donald Trump: (01:24)\nI’m telling you Sean, it was incredible. So, that’s Regeneron. But again, Eli Lilly has something similar. The kind of things we’re coming up with now are incredible. Remdesivir, but that’s a little bit different, works much differently actually. But these things are absolutely incredible. I think I’m going to try doing a rally on Saturday night if we have enough time to put it together. But we want to do a rally probably in Florida on Saturday night. I might come back and do one in Pennsylvania the following night. It’s incredible what’s going on, because I feel so good.\nSean Hannity: (02:01)\nHave you had a test since your diagnosis a week ago?\nPresident Donald Trump: (02:05)\nWell, what we’re doing is probably the test will be tomorrow, the actual test, because there’s no reason to test all the time. But they found very little the infection or virus, if any. I don’t know that they found any. I didn’t go into it greatly with the doctors. We have these great doctors at Walter Reed, and you do rely on them. They’re really fantastic talents, and they came in from Johns Hopkins also and other places. Yeah. When you’re president, there are so many doctors looking over me. I think I’m the most analyzed human being in the world right now. But we have… They had people at not only Walter Reed which is incredible with the job they do, but also Johns Hopkins and other hospitals. I think they’re amazed at how quickly this went frankly.\nSean Hannity: (02:52)\nLet me ask you, the Debate Commission said earlier tonight that their decision is not going to be reversed even if you get a full, healthy go ahead from all of your doctors and follow the CDC guidelines. How do they get to unilaterally decide that without consulting with you or former Vice President Biden’s campaign even?\nPresident Donald Trump: (03:20)\nWell, I didn’t even want to use them. Last time, I had a big problem. They isolated my mikes when I had one debate… We had three debates with Hillary. Or I think the first debate, they… Excuse me. On the first debate, they asked isolated the mike and they isolated it very, very seriously, and they actually apologized to me. And I said-\nSean Hannity: (03:43)\nIn 2016?\nPresident Donald Trump: (03:44)\n… “What’s this all about?” They were Clinton people. And I said, “We ought to just do the debates ourselves, John. We ought to just do it ourselves.” I pick… I’m the president, so we won’t to have debates. I’d rather just do it ourselves. Pick some good anchor. So I ended up with Chris Wallace who’s essentially… Look, his father did me once or twice. Twice, I guess. Those 60 minutes, he was great, Mike. Chris is not Mike that I can tell you. He’s not even close, but Chris was terrible. He was protecting Biden the whole night. I asked Biden about, “Why did he get all of that money from the Mayor of Russia, from the wife of the Mayor of Russia?” Then Chris wouldn’t let that be answered.\nPresident Donald Trump: (04:23)\nWhen I said, “What did you do with a billion dollars? You’re not getting a billion dollars to Ukraine unless you get rid of the prosecutor.” Chris wouldn’t let that. He protected him. The guy was choking like a dog. He couldn’t answer the questions and he was choking like a dog. And Chris kept staying, and so now we have another one. I didn’t know this, but the other one is from C-SPAN and he’s never-Trumper, and I think somebody said he worked for Biden at one point. These are the people we get.\nPresident Donald Trump: (04:50)\nThat’s okay, because I’ve had some bad ones over the years, and I’ve got an unblemished record I think in the debating world according to the polls. If you look at [inaudible 00:04:59] 15 debates last time, and they say I won them all against very talented people in some cases. But I will say this, that it’s a very sad thing. Now you have this Debate Commission. It’s a joke. The commission’s a joke. Take a look at the letter they wrote me four years ago when they apologized. They were oscillating my mike. They were turning it up and down when I was speaking to Hillary, crooked Hillary who turns out to be very crooked.\nPresident Donald Trump: (05:25)\nLook at all the stuff we found out on Obama and Biden and her. So we’ll see what happens. But no, I’m not interested in doing a virtual. I’m not Joe Biden. I’m not going to do a virtual debate, sit behind a computer screen. That gives them the answers, because there’ll be handing him the answers just like he gets what he asks. He does news conferences, he does them and they give him the answer and they give him the question and they give him what kind of a news conference. He does them all the time. He was choking like a dog the other night, but Chris Wallace bailed him in. He just bailed him in or bailed him out.\nSean Hannity: (05:58)\nLet me ask you this, because I think this is… You have an opportunity to challenge Joe Biden directly. His campaign could make the decision to go forward with a debate, get any health check that they want and follow through and have two debates, and you could agree upon the rules. You don’t need a debate commission to do that. So I guess you have the ability to challenge Joe Biden to such a debate. Are you doing that tonight?\nPresident Donald Trump: (06:25)\nWell, I might. I’ll do it right through your show. Let’s go, Joe. Let’s have a fair… Let’s get a fair anchor, somebody like a great Sean Hannity. We’ll get Rush.\nSean Hannity: (06:34)\nOh, yeah.\nPresident Donald Trump: (06:35)\nWe’ll get Mark. We’ll get Laura.\nSean Hannity: (06:37)\nThat’ll happen.\nPresident Donald Trump: (06:37)\nWe’ll get [Judge Jeanine 00:06:38].\nSean Hannity: (06:37)\nThat’s going to happen.\nPresident Donald Trump: (06:41)\nWe got a lot of them out there. We got a lot. We’ll get Jesse or Pete. We got a lot of them. Tucker [inaudible 00:06:48] feeling good. [crosstalk 00:06:49] is a disgrace.\nSean Hannity: (06:49)\nYou’re going to get me killed on all the Fox talk. Let me ask you.\nPresident Donald Trump: (06:54)\n[inaudible 00:06:54] but this is a disgrace what’s going on. So now I find out the guy that’s doing it from C-SPAN is a never-Trumper, but I don’t mind that. Look at the people I’ve had in the past, and I’ve always won the debates. I had Martha Raddatz. Her hatred was so incredible I couldn’t believe it, but I beat Hillary in that debate easily. So I don’t mind that. It’s not even that. But I’m not going to sit behind a computer and have somebody feed him answers, because he has no idea, because he won’t be president for three months before the wonderful Kamala takes over with her. She’s the most liberal person in the senate. She’s not a socialist. She’s a step beyond socialism as you know.\nSean Hannity: (07:32)\nWhat did you think of the… What did you think of last night’s debate, sir?\nPresident Donald Trump: (07:34)\nI thought Mike was great, legitimately. I don’t mean because he’s with me and he’s my friend and he’s done a great job as vice president, I thought he was great. He’s a calm person. We’re really a good combination. A lot of people have said that for a long time. He’s a calm person. He’s a good person, and he was just… He couldn’t believe some of the things she was saying, and he really didn’t. He couldn’t believe it what she was saying. They lie. They lie so much, like fracking.\nPresident Donald Trump: (08:03)\nHim and her for a year, whatever the Democrat debate said, we are against fracking. We will… Biden says, “We will never ever see fracking and…” etc. As soon as he gets the nomination, he has to center over a little bit. No, we want to go fracking. We’ll be fracking. Her too, even her. I mean, she’s a super… Then they get beat up by AOC plus 3, because they said, you never said that before. Now the press gives them a pass. The reason they give them a pass is because they are fake. The news is fake, the enemy of the people and the press gives them a pass. If I ever did that, I would be excoriated.\nSean Hannity: (08:43)\nLet me ask you about the issue that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris refuse to answer, that is about packing the United States Supreme Court which would a change that hasn’t happened in 150 years. And-\nPresident Donald Trump: (09:00)\nYeah, terrible thing.\nSean Hannity: (09:00)\n… Joe Biden literally said today, and I honestly thought last night Kamala Harris would have a different answer. I thought when Mike Pence challenged her that she was going to say no, that they would not support it. Their non-answer’s revealing. Joe Biden went further today and said, “You’ll know my position on court packing the day after the election.” What’s your reaction to that?\nPresident Donald Trump: (09:26)\nI think it was a terrible thing to say. I think it’s so disrespectful to the people, and he should have said something, and say, “Look, to the best of my knowledge, this is probably what I’d do.” I think what he said was so disrespectful to the process and to the people. What he said then was just disgraceful. But what that means really is that they’re going to do it, because obviously, that means 100% that’s what they’re going to do. No, they’re going to end the filibuster and they’re going to do things that you wouldn’t have thought. I’d been fighting the filibuster with Mitch for a long time, because I said, “Mitch, they’re going to do whatever. If they ever got in, Schumer would do that on day one.” I agree that what they did was right.\nPresident Donald Trump: (10:09)\nYou take a look at what Mitch and some very good Republican senators, because it’s good for the country. But I said, “Here’s the problem. If they ever got in, day one, this would be the first move they make, end the filibuster,” the nuclear option as they call it. And they’ll do that… Not a week will go by, probably not a day will go by. But again, Harry Reid did it, that’s why we have so many judges. I want to thank you very much, Harry Reid. Because Harry Reid, he ended the filibuster and I’m going to have 300 judges by the time I finish. 300, it’s a record by the end of the first term. Think of that. It’s a record [inaudible 00:10:49] the term. By the end of the first term, I have 300 judges just about give or take a few couple. And-\nSean Hannity: (10:57)\nMr. President don’t-\nPresident Donald Trump: (10:57)\n… it’s all because of… Think of it, Sean. It’s all because of Harry Reid and a lot of good work-\nSean Hannity: (11:00)\n2013.\nPresident Donald Trump: (11:00)\n… by a lot of good Republicans including Mitch.\nSean Hannity: (11:05)\nDon’t you think or do you think that the people of this country need to know whether or not Joe Biden, if he were elected president would pack the courts, whether or not he would support statehood for places like DC, whether or not he would support ending the filibuster, whether or not even maybe pursue a constitutional amendment to abolish the electoral college? To me, these are fundamental questions that he is refusing to answer. What is your answer to his non-answer? In the media, I think he’s answered less than 100 questions since this whole campaign has started which I think makes these two debates that are forthcoming even more important than any average presidential year.\nPresident Donald Trump: (11:54)\nWell, he’s got a lot of non-answers. Look at Second Amendment, you never talk about Second Amendment. He wants to take away your guns 100%. He put Beto as a… He turned out to be… He was exposed by Ted Cruz and me, I think I helped a lot too. But he was exposed as a clown, as much worse than that, but I want to be nice, because it’s a nice evening show. But he was exposed as a clown. He wants to take away your guns. He’s going to take away your Second Amendment. Nobody ever… Nobody asks him about the Second Amendment anymore. Do you notice that? The Second Amendment is very important. It’s a big thing that we campaign on it. I protected this.\nPresident Donald Trump: (12:36)\nIf I weren’t president, you wouldn’t have a Second Amendment right now. And Biden does it. Nobody’s talks about life anymore, pro-life. Is he pro-life? No, he’s not pro-life. What is he? Why don’t you ask him that question? He doesn’t want to talk about it. But he endorsed a Governor of Virginia who not only executed a baby late term abortion, but executed a baby because he said the baby can be born and then you can kill the baby. He’s totally in favor of that. I can tell you, your pro-life groups are… They’re in mess. This is their one shot because what’s going on is so bad.\nPresident Donald Trump: (13:24)\nIt’s so evil. The governor of Virginia said, we will execute the baby after the baby is born, that’s… When you talk about late term abortion, this is early term execution, and it’s a very, very bad thing. But you don’t ever hear everybody talking about pro-life, pro-choice with Biden. Did you ever hear it? I haven’t heard it. Very rarely do you hear it? I don’t think he’d know how to discuss it. But very importantly, a Second Amendment. They just don’t discuss the Second Amendment. He’s going to take your guns away. So everybody with a gun, you can’t vote for him because you’re not going to have your gun. At the same time, they want to defund the police.\nPresident Donald Trump: (14:01)\nSo if you’re not going to have police protection and by the way, you can’t have a gun. So if one of these maniacs breaks into your house at night because there are no cops around and you don’t have a gun to protect yourself, that’s a great combination. The suburbs are going to fall. A lot of people talk about the women of the suburbs. Women of the suburbs, they do or don’t like Trump. I don’t know. But what I’ve done is incredible for the suburbs. The suburbs are over as you know. The suburbs have become more unsafe than the cities run by the Democrats. And so I think I should do very well with suburban women, because I’m the one that’s protecting them both in terms of law and order and in terms of zoning.\nPresident Donald Trump: (14:44)\nThey want to build low-income housing right next to your house as the American dream is destroyed, but they don’t talk to Biden about this. They don’t talk to him about law and order. I said to him the other night, “Mention the words law and order.” He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. I said, “Don’t mention the word law and order. Go ahead.” He wouldn’t do it. And then of course Chris Wallace came in to protect him.\nSean Hannity: (15:09)\nLet me ask you this Mr. President if I may, I played at the beginning of the show. We don’t have a lot of time left, I won’t play it again. Joe Biden twice in the debate that he had with you said he will eliminate the Trump tax cuts. Now he’s saying only on people $400,000 or more, but that’s… I’ll let you explain it. He says he’s not against fracking, but I have him saying he will eliminate fracking twice, and we played that tape.\nSean Hannity: (15:38)\nHe has repeatedly said, and Kamala Harris last night falsely claimed that you do have yet to once condemn white supremacy, yet I showed multiple instances when you have done just that, the neo-Nazis, David Duke, white supremacy, white nationalism, disavowing David Duke. And yet they continue to spread that falsehood. Your reaction, because they don’t seem to get called out by the media on the fact that what they are saying is false.\nPresident Donald Trump: (16:09)\nAnd I condemn the people on the left like Antifa that are burning down your cities all summer long and without any control whatsoever. They’re all Biden people, meaning not Biden. Biden’s not smart enough to know what the hell it even is, but they’re of that philosophy. I condemn them very strongly, very, very strongly. It’s not just the right. It’s the right, it’s the left. But the left has been the problem up for a long time. Antifa is a big, big problem. I see Whitmer today, she’s complaining, but it was our justice department that arrested the people that she was complaining about.\nPresident Donald Trump: (16:44)\nIt was my justice department that arrested them. But instead, she goes and does her little political act and she keeps her state closed although we just won the big case as you know to open up Michigan, because what she’s doing is a horrible thing to the people. The churches are closed, the schools are closed and all state is closed. People are being hurt very badly by it in the form of drinking and suicides and depression. It’s a very sad thing. But now, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes. And very sadly, if you take a look, he wants to raise taxes, but he says he’s going to end our tax cut. Well, people are getting actually much more.\nPresident Donald Trump: (17:22)\nMike [Inaudible 00:00:17:23], he said 2000 was actually much more than $2,000 in child tax credits, which is a $1000 a child. but he wants to take all that away. So therefore, if you do nothing else, you’re raising taxes by the largest percentage in the history of our country. If he terminated my tax cuts, which is one of the reasons that our economy has done so great, even now in this pandemic which hopefully we’re rounding the turn and we have incredible cures and a lot of therapeutics and the vaccines are going to be coming very soon. But I’ll tell you what I took is incredible. To me, I viewed it as a cure. It’s incredible, and we’re going to get it to everybody free of charge.\nPresident Donald Trump: (18:01)\nIt’s going to hospitals. Starting very soon, the military is going to be delivering it. But he’s looking to do big, big tax cuts, big, big tax increases at a level that’s never been seen. Nobody’s ever gotten the cuts that I got. I got the biggest tax cuts ever given as you know Sean, better than probably most. But he’s going to end those tax cuts and reverse them. And now, people are going to pay $2000 plus child tax credits, all that. It’s going to be a disaster for our country. It’s going to put our country into a depression. Your 401ks are going to go down the tubes, and your jobs are going to go away, and you’re going to have a depression the likes of which our country has never seen before. And that possibly includes 1929.\nSean Hannity: (18:47)\nMr. President, there has been articles out, and I would assume that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not giving their position on court packing would be a national ad. I assume them both on record saying they would ban fracking would be an ad that would run on a lot of cycles in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Their website that endorses the Green New Deal, and Joe Biden saying he would spend trillions of dollars on it and pledging that. What would the new Green Deal look like in your view if implemented as promised by both Joe Biden and as a cosponsor with Kamala Harris in the US Senate?\nPresident Donald Trump: (19:30)\nWell, it’s a deal that was conceived up by not smart people, AOC plus 3 and others, but I don’t even think they had any experience in the environment. But this was a deal conceived up. The real price is $100 trillion. That’s more money that this country could make in 100 years if things went well. They literally want to take buildings down and rebuild them with tiny little windows. Little windows, so you can’t see out, you can see the light. The whole thing is so crazy. It’s such a crazy thing. Take a look, Biden agreed to this with crazy Bernie, because they have the manifesto.\nPresident Donald Trump: (20:11)\nThey’ve agreed to most of these things, and it’s going to cost more money. Our country will be a Ninth World country, not a Third World country, a Ninth World country. We won’t have energies. Look at what’s happening with the rolling blackouts in California? Looking at where California is going to have to ration water? You know why? Because they set millions of gallons of water out to sea, out to the Pacific because they want to take care of certain little tiny fish that aren’t doing very well without water to be honest with you. But it’s a very sad thing that’s happening. It’s still common sense. Even the fires in California. I talk about, you need…\nPresident Donald Trump: (20:53)\nI was with governor Newsom. I get along with him very well. We disagree on a lot of things, but I get along with him. Number one, you should let water come down from the North and accept it instead of throwing it out to the Pacific. But you also have to have forest management. We send them so much money. I don’t have to, but I want to help California. But they have the biggest forest fires because they don’t manage their land. They don’t have separators. They have trees that have been laying on the ground that are stone cold dead, dry like a matchstick. You throw a cigarette butts on between the leaves and the trees, everything catches on fire. You lose 200,000 acres in a short period of time. They get to manage their forest. And if they manage their forest, you’re not going to see the forest fires.\nSean Hannity: (21:40)\nMr. President, the Heritage Foundation identified nearly 1000 convictions on voting fraud. There have been… You have expressed many times your concerned about some of the changing laws and rules and have spoken negatively about these changes. But with that said, a lot of states have now begun early voting. Some will be starting in a week or two. Will you encourage your supporters to get out and vote early?\nPresident Donald Trump: (22:10)\nWell, I want them to vote, but I will say this, absentee is okay, because absentee ballots… Excuse me. Absentee ballots are fine, because absentee ballots, you request, you ask for a ballot and you request and that’s it. Absentee ballots are absolutely fine. You request them, you fill them in, you send them back in. But these unsolicited ballots, universal unsolicited ballots Sean, it’s going to be a disaster the likes of which we’ve never seen. We will never have seen an election like what’s going to take place. Thousands of ballots all over the country are being reported. Some thrown in garbage cans with my name on them. Some thrown in trays in a river. What’s going on is absolutely crazy. We have people watching. We have US attorneys watching. We have sheriffs watching. We have US Marshals watching. But with all of that-\nSean Hannity: (23:05)\nWith that said-\nPresident Donald Trump: (23:05)\n… you’re talking about millions of ballots are being sent out-\nSean Hannity: (23:09)\nWith that said, if there’s in-person early voting-\nPresident Donald Trump: (23:13)\n… [crosstalk 00:23:13] big and tremendous fraud.\nSean Hannity: (23:14)\n… would you prefer that your supporters, if that’s the system and that’s what the law is, would you prefer that they get out early also so that there’s not a big deficit heading into election day?\nPresident Donald Trump: (23:28)\nWell, my supporters are going to be mostly people that vote. They go to the vote the old fashioned where it’s like go to the voting booth and vote, which first of all, we should have voter ID all over the country. We don’t. When you buy something, you have voter ID. To get into the Democrat National Convention, you had to have voter ID.\nSean Hannity: (23:46)\nThat’s true. I had to have it four years ago.\nPresident Donald Trump: (23:51)\nRight. But to get into vote, you don’t need voter ID in many places. In many places, you do. Indiana has a great system. You have many places where you do have it. But we should have voter ID, universal voter ID. When you go to vote, they should see who you are, make sure that it’s not fraudulent. But this will be one of the greatest fraudulent, most fraudulent elections ever because of this whole thing with… They’re sending out millions and millions and millions of ballots. Where are they sending them? Who’s sending them? Where are they going? Where are they coming back from? How many are fraudulent? Are they being thrown away? Are they being sold?\nPresident Donald Trump: (24:27)\nAre they being harvested? It’s a terrible thing, Sean. Despite that, I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory. I saw some polls just now, some real polls not the fake news polls where they put out fake numbers like at CNN and ABC, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, NBC. It’s the same stuff as I had. It’s not nearly as bad as it used to be. It used to be much worse believe it or not. It’s hard to believe when you think of it. But I’m looking at polls that are doing great. We’re doing great in Ohio. We’re doing great in Iowa. We’re doing great in many, many places, many places. Then you come home, you turn on television. You say, gee, I’m four down. I can’t believe it. But they’re the fake polls.\nSean Hannity: (25:05)\nLast question, and I only have about a minute for you to answer. And that is the, we now discovered that the CIA had briefed then President Obama on a plan that Hillary Clinton concocted to distract from her email server scandal and concoct this Russia hoax. We also learned that she paid… We already knew she paid for the dirty Russian misinformation dossier, and that the source was Steele’s dossier was a known Russian operative for over 10 years. They still went forward with it. In the 40 seconds, we have left your reaction to this new news?\nPresident Donald Trump: (25:41)\nWe caught them spying on our campaign. This is treason. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected administration/ president. We have all the evidence down. Now, we have to see what the law enforcement’s going to do with it, but we caught them spying. As sure as you’re sitting there, I assume you’re sitting, but as-\nSean Hannity: (26:03)\nI’m sitting.\nPresident Donald Trump: (26:04)\n… sure as you’re sitting there, we caught them spying on our campaign. You know that almost better than anybody. And it’s something when you see the New York times, Washington Post get [inaudible 00:26:14] surprises they got everything wrong. They get everything wrong. We caught them spying in our campaign. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected… And then they talk about, we want a peaceful transition of power. Peaceful-\nSean Hannity: (26:28)\nWe know what Hillary Clinton said.\nPresident Donald Trump: (26:30)\n… [crosstalk 00:26:30] answer was that answer last night. Peaceful transition. Look what they did. They spent three and a half years trying to terminate a presidency.\nSean Hannity: (26:37)\nMr. President, we wish you and the First Lady and every American that contracted COVID a very speedy recovery. Very, very positive news on Regeneron and Eli Whitney and the therapeutics, and Operation Warp Speed seems to be moving along nicely. We pray that it gets finished-\nPresident Donald Trump: (26:55)\nIt’s doing really well.\nSean Hannity: (26:55)\n… quickly. All right, sir-\nPresident Donald Trump: (26:56)\nThank you very much.\nSean Hannity: (26:57)\n… thank you. 26 days.\nPresident Donald Trump: (26:58)\nThank you, Sean.\nSean Hannity: (26:58)\nLet not your heart be trouble…",

         "Speaker 1: (00:00)\nPlease welcome to the stage, Vanessa Montes-Cazarez.\nVanessa Montes-Cazarez: (00:30)\nThank you all so much. It is an honor to be here today. My name is Vanessa Montes-Cazarez. I am the daughter of two hardworking Mexican immigrants who came here in search of the American dream. My mother is no longer with us, but very present in my heart. She taught me the value of hard work and sacrifice. She taught me to be a woman of faith and love above all. I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, where due to the immense sacrifice of my parents’ hard work, I was able to attend board Bourgade Catholic High School, and I am a proud graduate of Arizona State University. I am a business owner. I own several small businesses, including Legends Event Center, one of the most popular venues in Phoenix, Arizona. If you told me earlier this year, just a few months ago, that I would be standing before you introducing you to the future president and vice president of the United States, I would have never believed it. This has been a hard year for many of us. In my industry, the events business, we have felt the impact of the coronavirus pandemic especially hard. My business was shut down for six months. We have only started hosting smaller events in recent weeks. Afraid for my family’s livelihood, it was a sacrifice we made to keep our friends, families, and communities safe from this virus, but it wasn’t easy. And while big businesses and corporations benefited from the government assistance and loans, many small business in our communities, especially the Latino community, was left to fend ourselves. Our restaurants, our clothing stores, our tech companies. We are the backbone of this community and this city. We’re proud to be places where our family and friends celebrate major milestones and spend their hard-earned money. We’re proud to be a place where hard work along with talent and innovation can come together to create jobs and help us build better lives. We know that President Biden and Senator Harris understand the value of hard work. They understand that my business is more than just where I work. It’s a part of who I am. They understand that we measure how good our economy is doing by how well our workers are doing, whether their wages are going up, and whether their families are able to save a bit to get ahead, and whether their kids have a better life ahead of them.\nVanessa Montes-Cazarez: (04:15)\nJoe Biden and Kamala Harris have a plan to help us build back better. We know what we’re getting under Donald Trump. No plan for COVID-19 and no plan to help us safely reopen our businesses. As small business owners, we now know the stakes in this election, which is why I’m so excited early voting started yesterday in Arizona. I saw people lined up before the polls opened to be the first among to cast their ballots. This choice has never been easier. I am going to be a first week voter to make sure my vote is counted for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I am voting not just for me. I am voting for my whole family, for my six beautiful children, and for their future, for my fellow Latinos. There is so much on the line, but I have faith that we will elect the leaders that will restore the soul of our nation. As Mr. Biden says, ” [foreign language 00:05:50]. Together, we will build back better.” Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great privilege and honor to introduce to you two strong and outstanding leaders, Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Joe Biden.\nKamala Harris: (06:05)\nHey everybody. Hi. Where’s Vanessa? Where are you? Thank you, Vanessa. Thank you so very much for that introduction and for your leadership and all you do for the community here in Phoenix. Thank you. It’s good to see everybody. It’s good to be in the House of Labor. Earlier today, Joe and I had a chance to visit the American Indian Veterans National Memorial and pay tribute to the native Americans who have served our country in uniform. We were joined by the great Cindy McCain, a longtime friend of Joe’s and someone I greatly admire. And I was fortunate to serve with John McCain in the United States Senate and what an incredible, incredible American. He was a patriot of the highest order. And Cindy is supporting our campaign, isn’t that great? And she’s doing it because she knows that Joe and I will always do what she and John did, and that’s put our country first. So we thank Cindy.\nKamala Harris: (07:56)\nWe’re so excited to be here in Arizona today. And later today, we’ll stop and talk with workers and small business owners who are working so hard and doing everything right, but still struggling to get by. They are who I was thinking about last night at the debate. This election, more than any other in our lifetime, will affect every part of our lives, with consequences that may last generations. And there is so much at stake. Our nation is at a crossroads. Just think, all at the same time, we are experiencing the pandemic, the recession, a reckoning on racial justice, a changing climate that’s battering our coastlines and setting the West on fire, and the future of health care hangs on top of it all, because you see President Trump is in the Supreme Court right now, trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\nKamala Harris: (09:05)\nAnd along with Senate Republicans, he’s trying to jam through a Supreme Court Justice who will do exactly that, who will rip away protections from as many as 2.8 million Arizonans with preexisting conditions, 2.8 Arizonans with preexisting conditions. And while this president, of course, didn’t bring the virus to our shores, his reckless disregard for human life and for the wellbeing of the American people has allowed it to spread the way we have seen, and the casualties have been enormous. And so let’s not make any mistake. His refusal to contain this virus is what has wreaked havoc on our economy. And I know folks are hurting, but I also know this. We can overcome these challenges if we elect Joe Biden as our next president.\nKamala Harris: (10:18)\nAnd here’s the thing. Joe has had a plan for COVID at least since March. He’s been talking about this. He knows what this means and the kind of leadership that is required to get on top of it and get in control. Joe knows these things. Even, and you guys may have seen the debate last night, even when Joe didn’t have the briefing that Donald Trump and Mike Pence had on January 28th, Joe knew, because of experience, that this could be serious. And under his leadership, we will contain this virus and save lives and build our economy back better than before. Joe will-\nKamala Harris: (11:03)\nBack better than before. Joe will be a president who restores the soul of our nation. He’ll be a president who creates good paying jobs and eases the burden on working families. And above all, Joe will be a precedent who unites the American people, Democrats, and Republicans, and independents, old and young, from all backgrounds and races, to meet the greatest challenges of our time. And I plan on being right by his side, and we’ll be ready on day one. We’ll be ready on day one. But here’s the thing, Arizona. We need your help. We’ve got only 26 days left. So let’s not wake up the day after the election on November 4th, wishing we’d done more. Let’s organize and vote in numbers no one has ever seen before. Let’s send Mark Kelly to the Senate.\nKamala Harris: (12:14)\nVote like your life depends on it, because right now, it really does. And yesterday, Arizona, vote by mail ballots were shipped to homes across this state. And in-person early voting has started, including at the new McDowell Square voting center, just about a mile from here. So be a first week voter. A first week voter. And there are four ways to vote in Arizona. You can vote by mail. You can drop off your ballot at a dropbox. You can vote early in person, or you can vote in person on election day. And to learn more, go to, iwillvote.com/az and make a plan. Write down when, where, and how you will vote. And tell everyone you know to do the same, because Arizona’s future, America’s future, is in your hands. So let’s elect Joe Biden as the next president of the United States of America. And ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you the great Joe Biden.\nJoe Biden: (13:36)\nHello, Arizona. It’s great to be back. It really is. It’s great to be back. Thank you, Kamala. Thank you, [Vanessa 00:03:08]. Appreciate it very, very much. And we met backstage, and the first instinct we all had was to hug each other. And we went, “No, no. We got to stay 12 feet apart.” But folks, I want to give a special thanks to Ruben Gallego for being here. And you’re a big deal, man. I’m serious. And I notice he did something that… This is what we call, in our business, a busman’s holiday, coming to hear another politician speak, and having to put a tie on when he shows up without a tie. But thank you very much. I appreciate it, pal. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the president and COO of the Southwest Regional Council, Pete Rodriguez. Where are you, Pete? Is he in here, or is he back in his office? Wherever he is, I want to thank him-\nSpeaker 2: (14:57)\nNot in here.\nJoe Biden: (14:58)\nNot here now? Well, also so Fabian Sandez, president of the local 1912. And you’ve all been with me. We were talking, Kamala and I, coming down the hall, and we said… Not a joke. It was just purely coincidental. She said, “I love the carpenters.” She said, “The first outfit that endorsed me when I ran for attorney general for-”\nKamala Harris: (15:21)\nDA.\nJoe Biden: (15:21)\n“… the DA in San Francisco, were the carpenters.” And I said, “I remember mine well, a guy named Cal [McCullough 00:00:15:29], president of the Carpenter’s Union from New Castle, Delaware, one of the 350 year old city on the Delaware River was the first one to endorse me as well.” And so, you’ve been with me my whole career, and president Doug McCarron has been a long time friend. We’ve worked together a long time. 520,000 carpenters. That’s an incredible army to have behind you. And you are, I’m telling you. You have, my whole career, and I hope you know I’ve had years as well. There’s an old expression when I was growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It said, “You go home with them that brung you to the dance.” Well, the carpenters brought me to the dance, and you’re going home together. You’re going to have a seat at the table.\nJoe Biden: (16:13)\nFolks, people who shaped the skyline, who build the foundations, everything rely on, the carpenters. Labor brought me to the dance. And the only reason I’m able to run for president is because, standing here today, because of labor. I’ve never forgotten everything you’ve done for me and you’ve done for the country. I really mean it. I get in trouble for saying this, but it’s true. You’re the backbone of America. You’re the spine of America. You’re the ones who actually built the country, not Wall Street, bankers, and CEOs. You’re the ones who are going to rebuild it again. You’re going to build it back better, for real. Kamala and can’t thank you enough. And folks, I don’t know if you caught it, but the senator had a heck of a night last night. I tell you what, you got to give me a great credit for knowing how to pick them. Right? I couldn’t be prouder. She’s like a younger sister.\nJoe Biden: (17:21)\nI couldn’t be prouder to be running alongside such a leader with remarkable character and vision. And who always, always, always is looking out for the people, always somebody else, not her. Always. And I want to tell you something, Kamala and I are about to kick off a tour, visiting businesses in this community. Small businesses in this community and all communities are more responsible for more jobs than… In the community, local small business owners… They’re busting their necks, than the major corporations. You add it all up, for real. Small businesses create more jobs in America than the major corporate entities. And this community has found itself having to go through some really challenging times, and I need not tell the congressman that. He’s forgotten more about it than most people know.\nJoe Biden: (18:16)\nAnd like Chef Silvana. Chef Silvana owns two restaurants here in Phoenix. She had both. When they were struck by COVID, she had to close one of them down. And she’s working hard to keep the other one afloat, Barrio cafe, which we’re going to be visiting later this afternoon. But it isn’t easy. The loan Silvana was able to secure back in the spring because of the legislation passed by the Democrats in the House, helped her for a little while, but it wasn’t nearly enough. She’s scraping by week to week, trying to look out for her 10 employees, some of whom have been with her for decades. And on top of that, she’s facing, and I have permission to say this, she’s facing a terminal disease. Silvana had to cancel her own health insurance after finishing a round of treatment recently just to make ends meet. It’s devastating, and it’s heartbreaking, and it’s wrong.\nJoe Biden: (19:16)\nEvery American should be upset about what Savannah is going through. I think you all are. I know I am. Because I know, we know, it didn’t have to happen. If they had just done what you passed, just move forward. And then, I’ll talk about it in a minute. But Silvana’s story is increasingly common story for Arizona workers and small business owners. Too many Arizonans are facing hard times right now. They’re trying their best, but it never feels like it’s enough. You’re not looking out for a handout. They’re just looking for a fair shot. Just want an even shot. That’s all they’re looking for. And that’s how my dad felt when he couldn’t find work in Scranton when coal died, he had to move on. I remember him taking us, what I call the longest walk any parent has to make up a short flight of stairs to tell their kid, “Honey, I’m sorry, but you can’t go back to St. Paul’s. You can’t go play in that little league anymore. Dad’s lost his job. There’s no job here. I’m going to have to move.”\nJoe Biden: (20:17)\nI remember him taking us to our grandpop’s house. Me, and my brother, and my sister, and my mom was certainly going to have another child. And we all went home. I thought about how hard it must’ve been for my dad. So many people in this town have done the same thing. Have to go to his father-in-law, the father of four boys and a girl, and say, “I have to ask you a favor.” I know how much pride it cost him. “Can you take care of them for a year? I’ll be back. I promise. I’ll come home every weekend.” It was only 159 miles, but it seemed like the end of the world. But he went down, and by the time he was able to get a good job, a job enough to get us an apartment in a place called Claymont, Delaware. Because he had been raised in Wilmington, Delaware. He ended up, then, getting a good job, a decent job, managing a car dealership. He worked hard to build a decent middle-class life. And it wasn’t easy for him. He had an expression. He’d always say, and really, I mean this sincerely… He said, “I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in hell expect them to at least understand my problems. Just to understand them.” And America, I think, deserves a president who understands what the American people are going through, who sees who you are, what you want to be, who cares about your health, your prosperity, your dream, your American dream. You’re facing real challenges right now. And the last thing you need is a president who exacerbates them, who ignores you. And I’m going to say it. I’ve been saying for a while. It’s my perspective from Scranton. A president who looks down at us, who thinks that if you put your life on the line for the nation, you’re a loser, a sucker.\nJoe Biden: (22:03)\n… line for the nation, you’re a loser, a sucker. As we were talking about with Cindy, my Beau, my son Beau who just passed, not just, passed away, now it’s going on five years, it seems like yesterday, won the Bronze Star and [inaudible 00:22:16] Service Medal. He was a volunteer. [inaudible 00:22:20] but he volunteered. He had to get an exception to be able to go to Iraq for a year. And I promise you, he wasn’t a loser. He wasn’t a sucker. He, like all the veterans we met with this afternoon alongside Cindy McCain, they’re Patriots. They’re people understand that being an American is about recognizing there’s some things bigger than yourself.\nJoe Biden: (22:45)\nCindy’s husband, John McCain, who I had the great privilege of him asking me to do his eulogy, we used to argue like hell. We were like two brothers. We’d fight like hell, but we always, always, always ended up together. And that’s how it used to be. It used to be that way across the board. He wasn’t a loser. They’re all heroes. And you know what? They deserve better than a president who will say anything to deflect responsibility for any mistake he makes. I don’t know whether you noticed, he recently said that, they asked him where he got the COVID, he said, “I probably got it from Blue Star parents.” They’re people who lost a child in battle. He said, “Because they like to get close to me and hug me. I don’t know how to say no.”\nJoe Biden: (23:36)\nLook, we’ve paid too high a price already for Donald Trump’s chaotic, divisive leadership. More than 210,000 Americans have lost their lives to this virus. We lose more every single day. Now, these 6,000 Arizonans have been lost. I mean, 6,000 gone, gone. More than 220, 000 Arizonans have been infected with COVID. 122,000 jobs in Arizona still haven’t come back. Nine times more Arizonans are on unemployment each week than before this crisis hit. But businesses like Silvanna’s restaurant are closing, schools aren’t back to normal, because Donald Trump can’t focus on what matters. When the House passed the so-called Heroes Act, that’s that second big package they passed to get people on their feet again some time ago, but the President and Mitch McConnell did nothing to move the legislation.\nJoe Biden: (24:42)\nA lot of cities and states are going bankrupt because they have to balance their budgets. Our founders are pretty smart. The reason they wrote the Constitution the way they did is the Congress, the Senate, the House, the government could deficit spend in order to compensate for being able to make sure we got out of the hole. Trump is spending more time, I’ve been calling on this, as you probably know for the last four months, he should get out of his bunker and out of the sand trap from his golf courses. Not a joke. I mean, think about it. He never once, I’ve been around a while, he never one single time tried to bring Democrats and Republicans together in the White House to try to get a settlement. Not once. You can’t name me a President in the lifetime of any of you that refused to deal that way in the middle of a crisis. But the leadership of Congress together to resolve the issue is something that wasn’t on his watch.\nJoe Biden: (25:45)\nAnd on Tuesday, Congressman, I’m sure you were probably not surprised by it, but on Tuesday he announced he’s walking away from negotiations to provide additional relief for working people, mom and pop businesses, schools. Just go down the line. On October 8th, exactly two months since the Emergency Small Business Program was closed, two months of small business owners in Arizona and across the country waiting and hoping for just a little bit of help to be able to stay open, more than 400,000 small businesses are permanently closed nationwide, 400,000, millions are struggling to hang on. The legislation has already been passed. It’s there. I handled what they called the Recovery Act when we inherited a great recession. I had the ability to deal with $800 billion spent in 18 months. All the outside groups pointed out less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. But do you know what we did? We provided $ 148 billion to the cities and states so you didn’t have to lay off cops, firefighters, sanitation workers.\nJoe Biden: (27:10)\nYou didn’t have to lay off nurses, close down county hospitals. You kept it open. And America got through it and began to generate the longest period of recovery in modern history. How many more have to go under? How many more dreams have to be extinguished because this President threw in the towel? Instead of focusing on your needs, he’s still trying to take away your health care. I mean, think about that. Just think about it. I’m not, but if I were a playwright, I’m writing a play, you’re in the single solitary outfit on Broadway that would take it, because it sounds like ridiculous fiction, in the middle of a pandemic, when already 10 million Americans have lost her employer based insurance because the employer went under, he’s trying to take away insurance from another 22 million people who got it for the first time in the pre-existing conditions that the Senator talked about.\nJoe Biden: (28:19)\nHe’s in the Supreme Court right now asking you to strike down the Affordable Care Act, the entirety of it, take away Medicare benefits for seniors. People don’t realize how deep this goes, and taking us back to a time when insurers could deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition. I want you to understand this. Women’s rights, I’m not talking about the right to choose now. Women’s rights, do you realize, before we passed, Barack and I passed the law, pregnancy was considered a pre-existing condition. Not a joke. Insurance companies were allowed to charge more for a woman for the same exact medical procedure than a man would have. Same one. And look what’s happened. Minority communities were devastated. But he’s done beyond that. He’s vowed, and this isn’t even get much attention because so much chaos is going on, he vowed to “terminate the funding source for social security.” That’s the holding tax you pay for social security, six and a half percent. He wants to terminate it so it makes it look like you got more in your paycheck.\nJoe Biden: (29:39)\nBut the actuary at the Social Security Department said, “If he does that, social security will be bankrupt by the middle of 2023. Benefits for more than a million Arizonans rely on the whole idea of a dignified retirement.” The fact is President Trump can only see the world from Park Avenue. He thinks that Wall Street built America. That’s why he let big corporations jump in on the front lines and get the recovery money that the Congress helped pass while small businesses struggled to stay open. But people don’t know because it’s so complicated, so much is happening. The Congressman can tell you. There was an Inspector General that they appointed, meaning somebody who had independent capacity to look into anything that was being done on the money being spent. I had an Inspector General overlooking the $800 billion I was responsible for. Twice every two weeks, I met with him in detail so we knew exactly where the money was going.\nJoe Biden: (30:52)\nWhat’s the first thing the President did? He fired the Inspector General. Think about that. 40% of all the money that was supposed to go to small businesses in the first time around went to the Mar-a-Lago crowd. The wealthy. I mean, if this wasn’t so true, I’d be reluctant to say it because it sounds so bizarre. This President has forgotten the people he said he’d fight for it. I’ll never forget because I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, a little steel town. I know that the middle class, working class built this country, and unions built the middle class. And I measure economic success on what families are talking about sitting around their kitchen tables, about having a decent job and benefits, about keeping their small business dream alive, about the conversations that took place this morning. But we need four new tires. The tires are bald on the car. We’ve got to wait. We can’t afford to get them. Can’t do it. Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to the community college because we just can’t borrow any money anymore?\nJoe Biden: (32:17)\nOr you have 20 million people today, 20 million people including here in Arizona, who are worried about whether they can pay this month’s mortgage payment. 20 million. And look at all the people who are worried they’re going to be thrown out in the street because they can’t pay their rent. These guys provided for all that. But nothing. Being able to look your kids in the eye. My dad would just said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it. And mean it.”\nJoe Biden: (33:03)\nIt would be okay. And mean it, and mean it. Well, that’s what Kamala and I are focused on, to say to our kids, “Honey is going to be okay.” That’s what we’re talking about. We’re going to get this virus under control. We’re going to reopen safely and strongly creating good paying jobs and working to end this era of rancor and division. Because if we’re going to get anything done, we have to do it together. I’ve been saying this since I announced and people thought I was being naive. They said, “Oh, you got a lot of things done, Joe, before, but that was the past.” Well, guess what? If we can’t bring the country together, we’re dead. This is a democracy. It depends on a consensus. You’ve got to bring people together.\nJoe Biden: (33:51)\nIt’s somewhat maybe presumptuous of me, but I made a major speech. I worked really, really hard on for a long time in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. And I did it two days ago. And I talked about, in Lincoln terms, that we have to bring America together. We can’t hold grudges. I’m running as a proud Democrat with a capital D, but I will be an American President, not a Democratic president. I’ll work as hard for those who didn’t support me… I promise you and look at my record… As those who did support me. Because the fact is that’s the job of a President. It’s a duty to care for everybody, not just who voted for you. After all we’ve been through, all America’s accomplished, all the years we’ve stood as a beacon to the world, we cannot allow ourselves to remain divided.\nJoe Biden: (34:55)\nWe have the ultimate power in our hands. You know what that power is? That little sticker you have on, the power to vote. Really, you can still register here in Arizona to vote. Early voting has already begun. And the vast majority of Arizonan’s vote by mail. And those mail-in ballots will start arriving in the next couple of days. So Kamala and I are saying to you, the best thing you can do is return your ballot quickly. Don’t risk delays. Return that mail in ballot as soon as you can and make sure your voice is heard, because if your voice can overcome and go out and vote, your voice through your vote can overcome every one of the challenges we face.\nJoe Biden: (35:46)\nAnd by the way, you know what they’re setting up. They’re setting up the argument that these votes aren’t going to matter. You saw what happened today. The FBI arrested a group of militiamen who had a plan to go in and to kidnap the governor of Michigan. You’ll see it in the news tonight, the governor of Michigan. Remember those guys with the assault rifles standing in her driveway? And the President is saying things in my debate with him, like “To the proud boys and all white supremacists group, stand down, but stand ready.” This is serious stuff. We can’t just win by a vote.\nJoe Biden: (36:38)\nWe’ve got to all turn out. We can be better than we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best. If we all get out and vote. And on our best we’re the United States of America and all can decide. It’s not some prosaic thing. The fact is America’s never, never, never, never, ever failed. We’ve stood up together. We’re the only nation in the world that’s come out of every single crisis… war or economic crisis… stronger than when we went into the crisis. So folks, I’m more optimistic today about America’s chances at home and in the world than I’ve ever been.\nJoe Biden: (37:27)\nI’ve been around a long time. I’ve worked with a lot of Presidents. I really mean it. We have a chance. A chance not only to improve our country, but to change the world. We have the most powerful military in the history of the world, but that’s not why the rest of the world repairs to us. It’s not the example of our power. It’s been the power of our example that has the rest of the world follow us. And that example is being trashed around the world. As the Senator said last night in the debate, it’s true. 17 major countries of the world are asked what leaders did they admire the most and trust the most? The Pugh Foundation, I think. You know what they said? More people trusted Xi Jinping of China and Putin of Russia than the President of the United States. That was profound security as well as economic impact.\nJoe Biden: (38:41)\nSo folks let’s not quit. There’s no quit in America. We have never, ever, ever, ever, ever quit. And if we need you to stand up at any time in our history, we need you now. Thank you for being here. God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: (39:04)\nThey parked the bus inside.\nSpeaker 3: (39:04)\nThank you everybody.",

         "Vice President Mike Pence: (04:52)\nWell, hello Nevada. Thank you all for coming out today. To my great friend, former Nevada Attorney General, Adam Laxalt, to Nevada Republican Party Chairman Mike McDonald, to Assemblyman Glenn Leavitt, all my fellow Americans from near and far, it is great to be back in the Silver State. And what a joy it is to be traveling today with a Marine Corps mom, a school teacher, my wonderful wife of 35 years, and the best Second Lady of the United States this country has ever had. Would you join me in thanking Karen Pence for who she is and all she does? Karen and I are thrilled to be with all of you here in Nevada today. But we’re here for one reason and one reason only, and that is that Nevada and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\nVice President Mike Pence: (06:12)\nIt’s on Nevada. We are 26 days away from another great victory for the American people and the road to victory runs right through Nevada. I thank you all for coming out today. Karen and I just got back from Utah. I had a little debate with Kamala Harris last night. Some people think we did all right. Thank you. But let me be clear, last night’s vice-presidential debate was not just a debate between two candidates. I think it was a debate between two visions. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine. They want to abolish fossil fuels, use taxpayer funds to abortion. They want to defund the police. And if you couldn’t figure it out last night, they want to pack the Supreme Court. President Trump’s vision, we’ve rebuilt our military. We cut taxes, rolled back regulations, unleashed American energy. We secured our border, stood with law enforcement, and for life and liberties of every American.\nVice President Mike Pence: (07:45)\nA lot of talk this morning on TV about who won the debate. But I think when you compare the Biden/Harris agenda with what President Donald Trump has done and will continue to do for America, there’s no question who won the debate. President Donald Trump won the debate hands down with an agenda that puts America first. And in 26 days, we’re going to win another great victory when we reelect President Donald Trump for four more years.\nAudience: (08:26)\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (08:27)\nAnd speaking of winners, it’s great to be here with a couple of real winners, a successful entrepreneur, a pioneer in technology, a principled conservative who’s represented the Silver State in the Nevada Assembly, and the next Congressman from Nevada’s Fourth Congressional district. Join me in thanking Jim Marshall and for his strong and principled campaign. And it’s also great to be here with a superstar, a small business owner, a family man, a superstar-\nVice President Mike Pence: (09:03)\n… a family man, a superstar athlete who has actually worked with underprivileged children while he was studying for the law. He is a man who is tough enough to take on the swamp in Washington, D.C. Join me in thanking the next Congressman from Nevada’s third congressional district, Dan Rodimer. I’m proud to stand here on the President’s behalf. I’m proud to stand here with these great leaders. I’m proud to be a part of a movement. You know, the truth is four years ago a movement was born. A movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. Here in Nevada you believe we could be strong again. You believe we could be prosperous again. You said yes to President Donald Trump all across this state in 2016 and I know Nevada is going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020. It’s because of what we’ve done.\nVice President Mike Pence: (10:08)\nI mean, think about it. Four years ago, we inherited a military that was hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values. But in three short years, we rebuilt our military. We restored the arsenal of democracy. Under President Donald Trump, not just as your Vice-President, but as the father of a United States Marine and the father-in-law of a United States Navy pilot, I’m proud to report we’re finally given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard the resources and the support that they deserve every single day. I know we’re standing here about an hour South of Creech Air Force Base and Nellis Air Force Base. Under President Donald Trump, we’ve actually seen the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.\nVice President Mike Pence: (11:14)\nWe’ve stood with those who serve, but we’ve also stood with all of you who wore the uniform of the United States. You know, when Joe Biden was Vice President, America saw years of scandal at the VA. You remember those days. It shocked the conscience of the nation. Veterans were literally dying while they waited for medical treatment that they had earned in the uniform of the United States, but all of that changed. As you know here in this state that was battle born, home to more than 200,000 veterans, under President Trump’s leadership we’ve signed the most sweeping reforms of the VA in history and Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran in America.\nVice President Mike Pence: (11:59)\nWould all the veterans who are with us today either stand or raise your hand if you’re able? Just give us a chance to say thank you one more time for your service to America. Thank you for your service.\nVice President Mike Pence: (12:23)\nIt’s been about security. It’s been about supporting our veterans. In our first three years, it was about three more things. It was about jobs, jobs, jobs. Where Joe Biden wants to raise taxes, President Donald Trump in our first three years cut taxes across the board, rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade. In just three short years, businesses large and small created more than seven million good paying jobs, including 115,000 jobs right here in the Silver State. Wages rose across the board, fastest pace in 10 years. They rose most rapidly for hard working, blue collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no more.\nVice President Mike Pence: (13:20)\nHere in the home of the legendary Hoover Dam, I’m proud to report that we’ve unleashed American energy like never before and under the President’s leadership. At a time when you hear the other side talking about abolishing fossil fuels, about banning fracking, they got their two trillion version of the Green New Deal. Under President Donald Trump, America’s become a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. We’re energy independent, Nevada. We’re going to keep it that way with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. We’ve stood for our national defense, our veterans, our jobs and American energy. President Donald Trump has stood for the rule of law every single day. This President has already seen appointed to our federal courts more than 215 conservative judges, including Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. I can tell you they’re all men and women who will uphold all the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms.\nVice President Mike Pence: (14:43)\nNow last month, our nation paused rightly to honor the life and service of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. When the memorials were over, President Donald Trump fulfilled his Constitutional duty when he nominated a principled, conservative woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. I can tell you, I’m a fan of Judge Barrett and not just because she’s from Indiana. Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a principled conservative who has an inspiring personal story. She comes from the heartland. She’ll bring that commitment to our Constitution to interpret laws as written, to not legislate to the bench, to the Supreme Court of the United States. After the Senate does their part with hearings coming up early next week, they’re part to advise and consent, I know that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be Justice Amy Coney Barrett because, Nevada, we’re going to fill that seat. We stood for the rule of law, strengthened the conservative foundation underpinning our Constitution in our courts and President Donald Trump has stood every day with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will. President Donald Trump and I know that the men and women who serve in law enforcement around this country are the best people in America. They deserve the respect of every American every single day.\nVice President Mike Pence: (16:44)\nNow, the President and I will always respect the Constitutional right of Americans to peaceful protest. But as I said last night, rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech. Violence against innocent civilians and law enforcement will not be tolerated and those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\nVice President Mike Pence: (17:14)\nNow, for months all Joe Biden ever talked about was peaceful protest. Remember? As the American people literally watch their businesses and communities burn. Last night, I was joined by a Minneapolis native, a wonderful African-American business woman named Flora Westbrook. She traveled with us to Utah. She told us the story when I was in Minneapolis a few weeks ago about in the wake of the killing of George Floyd how the protesters came closer and closer to her salon that she had built 35 years ago. Then they burned it to the ground.\nVice President Mike Pence: (17:54)\nThe truth of the matter is Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that have led to violence in America cities. When you suggest-\nVice President Mike Pence: (18:03)\n… in America cities. When you suggest that you’re going to reduce support for those who serve and protect, you only embolden those who would do harm to our families.\nVice President Mike Pence: (18:13)\nAnd we’re still, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris believed that America is systemically racist. And as she said again, last night, they believe that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities. When Joe Biden was asked if he’d support cutting funding for law enforcement, he said, quote, “Yes, absolutely.”\nVice President Mike Pence: (18:34)\nLet me make you a promise, under President Donald Trump, we will always back the blue. We’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. President Trump, and I know you do, we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors. Under this president we have done both for the last three and a half years, and we’re going to continue to support law enforcement and improve the lives, the jobs, the education, and the opportunities for African-Americans and all of our minorities for four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (19:15)\nUnder this president we’re going to have law and order in every city, in every state for every American of every race, and creed and color, so help us God. It’s amazing to think all that we accomplished under this president, in those first three years. They were years that we had a Republican majority in the United States House and Senate. So right after we make sure we got four more years of President Donald Trump, we got to make sure that big Dan Rodimer and Jim [Marshit 00:19:53] are sent to Congress in a new Republican majority that retires Nancy Pelosi once and for all.\nVice President Mike Pence: (20:10)\nSo we rebuilt our military, we revived our economy, we stood for life and our liberties and law and order in our first three years. In a word, we made America great again.\nVice President Mike Pence: (20:25)\nAnd then the coronavirus struck from China, but as I said last night, before there were more than five cases of coronavirus in the United States of America President Donald Trump put the health of America first and did what no other American president had ever done, he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world.\nVice President Mike Pence: (20:51)\nNow, Joe Biden criticized it. He said it was hysterical and xenophobic, but I can assure you having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, President Trump’s decision that day alone saved countless American lives, and it allowed us to stand up the largest national mobilization since World War II. We reinvented testing, we saw to the manufacture and delivery of hundreds of millions of medical supplies to our incredible doctors and nurses. We’ve developed medicines that are literally saving lives. And as we stand here today, we’re on track to have the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year.\nVice President Mike Pence: (21:39)\nAnd let me just say on behalf of the president and the first lady how moved we’ve all been by the outpouring of prayers and support for both of them over this past week.\nVice President Mike Pence: (21:50)\nI spoke to the president this morning, he’s back to the White House, and he and the first lady are doing great. The medical care that they received, the medicines that they received are all a part of the national response that we’ve made available to people all across this country. And the outpouring of concern for our president and our first lady was emblematic of the love, and the concern, and care that the American people have shown to neighbors, and family members, and friends, and absolute strangers.\nVice President Mike Pence: (22:26)\nSo would you join me and just thanking all of the amazing healthcare workers who served our nation through this challenging time, and all those who’ve cared for those who suffered loss and struggle.\nVice President Mike Pence: (22:40)\nSo we’re slowing the spread, we’re protecting the vulnerable, and we’ll keep saving lives. And we’re opening up America again. With the strong foundation this president poured in our first three years, with the unprecedented relief that we secured from the Congress for families and for businesses, it actually literally saved 50 million jobs. Where we lost 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, we’ve already added 11.6 million jobs back to work, including 150,000 people back to work right here in the silver state. The American comeback is on; we’re opening up America, and we’re opening up America’s schools.\nVice President Mike Pence: (23:36)\nJust last week the president announced that we’re distributing a hundred million rapid point-of-care tests to states across the country to get our schools open, to keep our schools open, and keep our kids safe.\nVice President Mike Pence: (23:51)\nSo we’ve gone through a time of testing, but I came here today to say that in 26 days, we’re coming to a time for choosing. And the choice in this election has never been clearer, and the stakes have never been higher.\nVice President Mike Pence: (24:06)\nAnd it’s amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. You heard his running mate, Kamala Harris say last night that they were going to only raise taxes on certain Americans. But Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that on day one he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. I mean, the truth of the matter is President Donald Trump cut taxes across the board. It gave middle-class families a $2,000 tax break. It increased income and wages by $4,000, and we’re going to keep cutting taxes for the middle class for four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (24:51)\nJoe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape, including his own version of the Green New Deal, which is a whole lot like AOC’s version of the Green New Deal.\nVice President Mike Pence: (25:04)\nPresident Trump, he’s actually overseen the largest investment in public lands and our national parks in American history, the cleanest air and land in our history, the cleanest water in the world, and we’ve cut federal red tape and unleashed American energy all at the same time. And we’re going to keep doing it for four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (25:29)\nJoe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers, and free healthcare for illegal immigrants. President Donald Trump, he kept the promises he made to the people of Nevada. We made record investments in border security. Mexico is doing more to secure their Southern border and ours than ever before. And we’ve already built more than 300 miles of that border wall on the Southern border of the United States. And with four more years, we’re going to build it all.\nVice President Mike Pence: (26:04)\nAnd when it comes to jobs and trade, the contrast couldn’t be more clear. Under Joe Biden, his 47 years in Washington, DC, we saw deals like NAFTA. In the wake of NAFTA being signed into law in 1995, 60,000 factories closed, and many of those jobs went south of the border and overseas. And Joe Biden never lifted a finger to reform NAFTA. But thanks to the man who wrote The Art of the Deal, America got a better deal. NAFTA is gone, and the USMCA is here to stay. It’s a huge win for American jobs and American workers.\nVice President Mike Pence: (26:47)\nAnd where Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China every day, actually said it was a positive development to see the rise of China, to see China literally be half of our international trade deficit. From day one, President Donald-\nVice President Mike Pence: (27:03)\n… By international trade deficit. From day one, President Donald Trump put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over. And we’re going to stand strong with China until they open their markets, respect American private property rights, and put American jobs and American workers, the respect they deserve.\nVice President Mike Pence: (27:28)\nSo it’s been about security and prosperity. But as I said earlier, it’s also been about our most cherished values. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the Democratic Party actually support late term abortion. And Joe Biden wants to use taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. I tell you, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history, and we will keep standing for life for four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (28:20)\nWhen you look at their agenda, it’s clear. I said this at Fort McHenry. Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. Now, Joe Biden has said that democracy is on the ballot on November 3rd. Well, I think our economic recovery is on the ballot, law and order are on the ballot, but I also think there are things much more foundation. Much more fundamental to our country. In this election, I don’t think, Nevada, I don’t think it’s going to be whether America ends up more Republican or more Democrat, whether we end up more liberal or more conservative, more red or more blue. I think the choice in this election is whether America remains America.\nVice President Mike Pence: (29:13)\nIt’s whether we’re going to chart a course based on our highest ideals of faith and family and freedom and patriotism and the American flag and the Constitution of the United States, or whether we’re going to abandon that path and allow the radical left and Joe Biden and the Democratic Party to take our nation somewhere it’s never been before.\nVice President Mike Pence: (29:36)\nSo let me say today to all of you, standing here in the blazing sun of Nevada, for our freedom, for all the ideals that have always made America great and are making America great again, we need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be President of the United States of America. We’re going to re-elect President Donald Trump for four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (30:20)\nYou’re right. Four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means more support for our troops and law enforcement. And it’s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp. I’ve served around this president every day for the last three and a half years. And we’ve gotten to be very close friends. I’ve seen him when the cameras are off, and I’ll tell you what Nevada, there’s never been a day gone by when President Donald Trump hasn’t gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of Nevada. Now it’s our turn to fight for him. It’s on.\nVice President Mike Pence: (31:10)\nSo I need you to bring it. I need you to bring it. And not just you, but all of hundreds of people that were out on the road when I rolled in today. And freedom loving people all across the silver state. I want you to keep voicing your support, talk to your neighbors and friends at work and at worship, about all that we’ve done in the last three years about the way this president has led us through this challenging year and all that we have yet to do. Go tell the American people that the choice we face and remind the American people, the choice is in their hands.\nVice President Mike Pence: (31:48)\nAnd when you do have faith, that faith, I honestly believe the careful study of American history shows every time the American people have been given a clear choice between a future of more freedom and less freedom, they choose more freedom every single time. So go out and talk to your neighbors and friends and have faith that if we present the cause of freedom to them in this election, that they’ll stand with us. And if you’re of a mind to exercise that other kind of faith in the next 26 days, I encourage you to do that too. I truly do.\nVice President Mike Pence: (32:28)\nI mean, this is a challenging time in the life of our nation. It seems anymore like if you turn on the television, it’s like that little girl asked me last night. It seems like it looks like there’s more that divides us in America than unites us. But I’ve traveled all across this country over the last three and a half years, and I can tell you, there will always be more that unites the people of this great nation than could ever divide us. And chief among those things is faith. This is a nation of faith. So if you’re a person of faith, I encourage you to claim those ancient words that Americans have clung to through much more challenging times than we could even imagine. If his people were called by his name will humble themselves and pray. He’ll do like he’s always done in the long and storied history of this country. He’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land, this one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America, it’ll make a difference.\nVice President Mike Pence: (33:59)\nBut thank you for this especially warm welcome. It’s really great to be in Nevada, but Karen and I have a plane to catch. We’re headed to Arizona, and then we’re back to Washington DC. And I guarantee you, President Donald Trump is going to be back on the campaign trail before you know it, we’re going to take this case to the American people every day. And I just know, with your continued support every day between now and November 3rd, we’re going to make Nevada and America stronger than ever before. We’re going to make Nevada and America more prosperous than ever before. And with Jim Marchant and Big Dan Rodimer in a new Republican majority in the United States House of Representatives, with a renewed Republican majority in the United States Senate, and with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, and with God’s help, we will make America great again, again. So thank you very much. God bless you, and God bless America.",

         "Donald Trump Says He Won’t Participate in Virtual Debate Transcript October 8",
         "President Trump: (00:00)\nI beat him in the first debate. At the second debate, we have a never Trumper as a host, but that’s okay because I’d beat him in the second debate also. And I’m not going to do a virtual debate.\nMaria: (00:12)\nSo Mr. President, you’re not going to do it because the CPD, the commission on presidential debates announcing this morning that the second presidential debate will be virtual. You saying you’re not going to participate?\nPresident Trump: (00:24)\nNo, I’m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That’s not what debating’s all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate. It’s ridiculous. And then they cut you off whenever they want. I have a host who I always thought was a nice guy, but I see is a never Trumper. You know, it came out that he’s a never Trumper. And we do have some of them Maria, believe it or not, because they don’t like to win. And so, but I’m not doing, I’m not doing it a virtual debate.\nMaria: (00:47)\nI believe that moderator at one point…\nPresident Trump: (00:49)\nThey didn’t even tell us about the debate Maria.\nMaria: (00:52)\nSo you just learned this this morning?\nPresident Trump: (00:55)\nYeah. We learned it the same way you learned it. They called up two minutes ago and it was announced and they’re trying to protect Biden. Everybody is. Like that NBC disaster, where he went on the show with Lester Holt. It was like, it was meant for a child. It wasn’t meant for a grown person. He gets up and he says, “We’re not fracking. We’re not fracking.” He was fracking for six months. He was fracking. He was raising his very thin hand and he was fracking. And now all of a sudden, he’s not fracking. Well tell the Pennsylvania people that you’re going, it’s ridiculous. He said, he’s not fracking. That’s all he said. And then all of a sudden, he goes to a fracking mode. And how about her? She committed her life to it. And all of a sudden she’s a fracker. She’s a big fracker. They going to stop fracking the minute they get into office, they’re lying to everybody. They’re lying about so many different things, but you have to confront them people, you can’t do it over a computer.\nMaria: (01:49)\nI want to talk to you about that. I want to talk to you about what you heard last night. But, but Mr. President, you say you’re not going to do this debate. Address the criticism, Mr. President, the criticism that you removed your mask for a photo op, you got to the top of the steps. You removed it. People are worried about your recent diagnosis. Now you’ve got 30 plus people with coronavirus in and around the White House. Address that concern for us, Mr. President, as you tell the commission on debates you’re not going to do this virtually.\nPresident Trump: (02:18)\nYeah. Well, first of all, I think I’m better to a point where I’d love to do a rally tonight, I wanted to do one last night, but I think I’m better to a point that I feel better than I did you know, I jokingly said 20 years ago, I feel perfect. There’s nothing wrong. I had a case, I got it knocked out. I think it was Regeneron that was responsible for it. Because of that, it was sort of like almost a gift from heaven because of what I went through and I felt pretty lousy. A lot of people did. A lot of people do. No matter how good the security, you’re not going to protect yourself from this thing with just your standard anything, unless you just literally don’t come out and even those people found out. Did you see in New York City, the most heavily locked down place, the people that caught it the most were the people that were caught in their houses and their apartments. Okay?",

         "Susan Page: (00:00)\nGood evening. From the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, welcome to the first and only vice presidential debate of 2020 sponsored by the nonpartisan commission on presidential debates. I’m Susan Page of USA Today. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy. In Kingsbury Hall tonight, we have a small and socially distant audience and we’ve taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in this audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they’ve agreed to express that enthusiasm only twice—at the end of the debate and now, when I introduce the candidates. California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence. Senator Harris and Vice President Pence, thank you for being here. We’re meeting as President Trump and the First Lady continue to undergo treatment in Washington, after testing positive for COVID-19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery, and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the coronavirus. The two campaigns and the commission on presidential debates agreed to the ground rules for tonight. I’m here to enforce them.On behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching. One note: no one in either campaign or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance what topics I’ll raise or what questions I’ll ask. This 90 minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about 10 minutes each. I’ll begin a segment by posing a question to each of you. Sometimes the same question, sometimes a different question on the same topic. You will then have two minutes to answer without interruption by me or the other candidate. Then we’ll take six minutes or so to discuss the issue. At that point, although there will always be more to say, we’ll move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is lively, but Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil.\nSusan Page: (01:21)\nThese are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectful exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Let’s begin with the ongoing pandemic that has cost our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control. Over the past week, Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had more COVID cases over the past seven days than in the week before. Nine States have set new records. Even if a vaccine is released soon, the next administration will face hard choices. What would a Biden administration do in January and February that a Trump administration wouldn’t do? Would you impose new lockdowns for businesses and schools and hotspots, a federal mandate to wear masks? You have two minutes to respond without interruption.\nKamala Harris: (02:13)\nThank you, Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. We’re looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people, who in the last several months, had to file for unemployment. And here’s the thing, on January 28th, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it’s lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people, and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didn’t tell you.\nKamala Harris: (03:21)\nCan you imagine if you knew on January 28th, as opposed to March 13th, what they knew, what you might’ve done to prepare? They knew, and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said, “You’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask. You’re on the other side of his ledger if you don’t.” And in spite of all of that, today, they still don’t have a plan. They still don’t have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine, and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on, and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that. And frankly, this administration has forfeited their-\nSusan Page: (04:17)\nThank you, Senator Harris-\nKamala Harris: (04:18)\n… right to reelection based on this.\nSusan Page: (04:20)\nThank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, more than 210,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since February. The US death toll, as a percentage of our population, is higher than that of almost every other wealthy nation on Earth. For instance, our death rate is two and a half times that of Canada, next door. You had the administration’s coronavirus task force. Why is the US death toll, as a percentage of our population, higher than that of almost every other wealthy country? And you have two minutes to respond without interruption.\nMike Pence: (04:55)\nSusan, thank you. And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it’s a privilege to be on the stage with you. And our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was, he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical. But I can tell you having led the white house coronavirus task force that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War Two.\nMike Pence: (05:57)\nAnd I believe it saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time, we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests had been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies, so our doctors and nurses had the resources support they needed. And we began, really, before the month of February we started to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that have been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump’s leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe we’ll have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump, and I, and our task force has been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. And I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health-\nSusan Page: (06:59)\nThank you, Vice President Pence-\nMike Pence: (06:59)\n… of America first. And the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud-\nSusan Page: (07:03)\nThank you, Vice President Pence-\nMike Pence: (07:04)\n… of the sacrifices they have made. It’s saved countless American lives-\nSusan Page: (07:07)\nThank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, would you like to respond?\nKamala Harris: (07:10)\nAbsolutely. Whatever the vice president is claiming the administration has done, clearly, it hasn’t worked. When you’re looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss, and the vice president is the head of the task force and knew on January 28th, how serious this was. And then, thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed, the vice president said, when asked, “Well, why didn’t you all tell anybody?” He said, “Because the president wanted people to remain calm.”\nSusan Page: (07:52)\nWell, let’s [crosstalk 00:07:53]-\nKamala Harris: (07:53)\nNo. But Susan, this is important. And I want to add-\nMike Pence: (07:55)\nSusan, I have to weigh in here-\nKamala Harris: (07:56)\nMr. Vice President, I’m speaking.\nMike Pence: (07:57)\nI have to weigh in.\nKamala Harris: (07:58)\nI’m speaking.\nSusan Page: (07:59)\nYou can have 15 more seconds, and then we’ll give the vice-president a chance to respond-\nKamala Harris: (08:02)\nThank you. So I want to ask the American people, how calm were you when you were panicked about where you were going to get your next roll of toilet paper? How calm were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn’t know when they could go back? How calm were you-\nSusan Page: (08:15)\nThank you-\nKamala Harris: (08:15)\n… when your children-\nSusan Page: (08:16)\nThank you, Senator Harris-\nKamala Harris: (08:18)\n… couldn’t see your parents because you were afraid they could kill them.\nSusan Page: (08:20)\nLet’s give Vice President Pence a chance to respond. Vice President Pence, you have one minute to respond.\nMike Pence: (08:23)\nThere’s not a day gone by that I haven’t thought of every American family that’s lost a loved one. And I want all of you to know that you’ll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months, hasn’t worked, that’s a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made-\nKamala Harris: (08:44)\nI’m referring to the president-\nMike Pence: (08:45)\nBut the reality… If I may finish, Senator. The reality is Dr. Fauci said everything that he told the president in the Oval Office, the president told the American. Now President Trump, I will tell you, has boundless confidence in the American people, and he always spoke with confidence that we’d get through this together. But when you say it hasn’t worked… When Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx, and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said, if the president didn’t take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy, that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. That’s the reality.\nSusan Page: (09:22)\nThank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence-\nMike Pence: (09:22)\nThey also said to us, if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans.\nSusan Page: (09:27)\nVice President Pence-\nMike Pence: (09:28)\nOne life lost is too many, Susan. But the American people, I believe, deserve credit for the sacrifices that they have made, putting the health of their family and their neighbors first, our doctors, our nurses, our first responders.\nSusan Page: (09:41)\nThank you, Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (09:42)\nAnd I’m going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done.\nSusan Page: (09:45)\nVice President Pence, you were in the front row in a Rose Garden event 11 days ago, at what seems to have been a super spreader event for senior administration and congressional officials. No social distancing, few masks, and now a cluster of coronavirus cases among those who were there. How can you expect Americans to follow the administration…\nSusan Page: (10:03)\nHow can you expect Americans to follow the administration’s safety guidelines to protect themselves from COVID when you at the White House have not been doing so?\nMike Pence: (10:11)\nWell, the American people have demonstrated over the last eight months, that when given the facts, they’re willing to put the health of their families and their neighbors and people they don’t even know first. President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice. In the height of the epidemic when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey and New York and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done, and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sun Belt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward. But the reality is the work of the President of the United States goes on. A vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us, and the President introduced Judge Amy Coney Barrett.\nSusan Page: (11:05)\nYes, thank you. Thank you, Vice President.\nMike Pence: (11:07)\nIf I may say, that Rose Garden event, been a great deal of speculation about it. My wife, Karen and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for Coronavirus, and it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise. The difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not just mandates with the Coronavirus, but a government takeover of healthcare, the Green New Deal, all government control. We’re about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.\nKamala Harris: (11:48)\nLet’s talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader.\nMike Pence: (11:58)\nWhich we’ve always done.\nKamala Harris: (11:58)\nSpeaking of those things that you may not want people to hear, but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that, if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker, knowing you didn’t have enough money saved up, and now you’re standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of a administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let’s talk about caring about the American people. The American people have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people-\nMike Pence: (12:33)\nSusan, we talked about this.\nKamala Harris: (12:34)\nIt is asking too much of the people. That they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children.\nSusan Page: (12:42)\nI’m sorry. Kamala Harris, Senator Harris, I mean, I’m sorry.\nKamala Harris: (12:46)\nThat’s fine, I’m Kamala.\nSusan Page: (12:47)\nNo, no, you’re Senator Harris to me. For life to get back to normal, Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be vaccinated need to be vaccinated. But half of Americans now say they wouldn’t take a vaccine if it was released now. If the Trump administration approves a vaccine before or after the election, should Americans take it, and would you take it?\nKamala Harris: (13:11)\nIf the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it, absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I’m not taking it.\nSusan Page: (13:24)\nVice President Pence, there’ve been a lot of repercussions from this pandemic. In recent days, the President’s diagnosis of COVID-19 has underscored the importance of the job that you hold and that you are seeking. That’s our second topic tonight. It’s the role of the Vice President. One of you will make history on January 20th. You will be the Vice President to the oldest President the United States has ever had. Donald Trump will be 74 years old on inauguration day. Joe Biden will be 78 years old. That already has raised concerns among some voters, concerns that have been sharpened by President Trump’s hospitalization in recent days. Vice President Pence, have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with President Trump about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, do you think you should? You have two minutes without interruption.\nMike Pence: (14:20)\nWell, Susan, thank you. Although, I would like to go back.\nSusan Page: (14:23)\nI think we need to move on to the issue of vice presidency.\nMike Pence: (14:28)\nWell, thank you, but I would like to go back because the reality is that we’re going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time. In unheard of time, in less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials. And we’re right now producing tens of millions of doses. So the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine, if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with people’s lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year. And it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it’s unacceptable. And let me also say, the reality is, when you talk about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic.\nMike Pence: (15:29)\nIt was 2009. The Swine flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it ended up not being as lethal as the Coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the Swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the Swine flu. If the Swine flu had been as lethal as the Coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was Vice President, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own chief of staff, Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck that they did, “Everything possible wrong.” And we learned from that. They left the strategic national stockpile empty. They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learn from it, and I think the American people, I’m going to say again, can be proud of what we have done. And Senator, please stop undermining confidence in a vaccine.\nSusan Page: (16:32)\nSenator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked her Vice President Pence, which is, have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with Vice President Biden about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, and if you win the election next month, do you think you should? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\nKamala Harris: (16:53)\nLet me tell you first of all, the day I got the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable days of my life. I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I’d be sitting here right now, I know, would make her proud. And she must be looking down on this. Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service, and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system.\nKamala Harris: (17:58)\nI was elected the first woman of color, and black woman to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest department of justice in the United States. Second only to the United States Department of Justice. And there, I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for-profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I’ve been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation in hotspots around the world. I’ve traveled the world, I’ve met with our soldiers in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump unifying our country around our common values and principles.\nSusan Page: (18:58)\nThank you, Senator Harris. Neither President Trump, nor Vice President Biden has released a sort of detailed health information that had become the modern norm until the 2016 election. And in recent days, President Trump’s doctors have given misleading answers, or refused to answer basic questions about his health. And my question to each of you in turn is, is this information voters deserve to know? Vice President Pence, would you like to go first?\nMike Pence: (19:26)\nWell, Susan, thank you. And let me say on behalf of the President and the First Lady, how moved we’ve all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President. And I do believe it’s emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the Coronavirus. But the care of the President received at Walter Reed Hospital, the White House doctors was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along the way will continue. The American people have a right to know about-\nMike Pence: (20:03)\n… they will continue. The American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their president, and we’ll continue to do that. But I’m just extremely grateful and was more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support. And Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions and genuine concern. And I also want to congratulate you, as I did on that phone call, on the historic nature of your nomination.\nKamala Harris: (20:29)\nThank you.\nMike Pence: (20:30)\nI never expected to be on this stage four years ago, so I know the feeling, but the reality is we’ve got an election before the American people in the midst of this challenging year and the stakes have never been higher, but I think the choice has never been here.\nSusan Page: (20:46)\nThank you, Vice President. I want to give Senator Harris a chance to respond to the same question I asked, which is, do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates and especially about presidents, especially when they’re facing some kind of challenge?\nKamala Harris: (21:01)\nAbsolutely. And that’s why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly by contrast that the President has not, both in terms of health records, but also let’s look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said, “You mean $750,000?” And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt, it means you owe money to somebody. And it’d be really good to know who the President of the United States, the commander-in-chief owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the President’s decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you or self-interest?\nKamala Harris: (22:01)\nSo, Susan, I’m glad you asked about transparency because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He is honest, he is forthright, but Donald Trump on the other hand has been about covering up everything.\nMike Pence: (22:22)\nSusan, Susan-\nSusan Page: (22:22)\nThank you, Senator Harris. I want to give you a chance to respond, Vice President.\nMike Pence: (22:25)\nWell, look, I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your public service as well.\nKamala Harris: (22:33)\nThank you.\nMike Pence: (22:33)\nThe American people have a president who was a businessman, he’s a job creator. Who’s paid tens of millions of dollars in taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes. He’s created tens of thousands of American jobs. And the President said those public reports are not accurate. And the President’s also released literally stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden, 47 years in public service compared to President Donald Trump, who brought all of that experience four years ago-\nSusan Page: (23:10)\nThank you Vice President-\nMike Pence: (23:11)\n… and turned this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulations-\nSusan Page: (23:15)\nThank you, Vice President Pence-\nMike Pence: (23:16)\n… unleashing American energy, fighting for free and fair trade. And all of that’s on the line-\nSusan Page: (23:20)\nThank you Vice President Pence-\nMike Pence: (23:21)\n… if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are elected.\nSusan Page: (23:23)\nThat’s a good segue into our third topic-\nKamala Harris: (23:26)\nThat’s a great segue.\nSusan Page: (23:26)\n… which is about the economy. This has been another aspect of life for Americans, it’s been so affected by this coronavirus. We have a jobs crisis brewing. On Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate had declined to seven point nine percent in September, but the job growth had stalled. And that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry, at Disney, and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking for work. Nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year haven’t been replaced. Those hardest hit include Latinos, Blacks, and women. Senator Harris, the Biden, Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy. And you would pay for that new spending by raising four trillion dollars in taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and create jobs. Would raising taxes put the recovery at risk? And you have two minutes to answer uninterrupted.\nKamala Harris: (24:30)\nThank you. On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn’t be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America’s economy based on the health and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing, which is why he passed a tax bill benefiting the top one percent and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a two trillion dollar deficit that the American people are going to have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill, he’ll get rid of it. And what he’ll do with the money is invest it in the American people.\nKamala Harris: (25:17)\nAnd through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do, I remember hearing about some infrastructure week, I don’t think it ever happened, but Joe Biden will do that. He’ll invest in infrastructure. It’s about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe was going to invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development, so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two-year community college, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you’ll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we’ll make sure that if you have student loan debt, it’s cut by $10,000.\nKamala Harris: (26:09)\nThat’s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy which is, it’s about investing in the people of our country. As opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go off-shore to do their business.\nSusan Page: (26:24)\nThank you Senator Harris.\nKamala Harris: (26:25)\nYou’re welcome.\nSusan Page: (26:26)\nVice President Pence, your administration has been predicting a rapid and robust recovery, but the latest economic report suggests that’s not happening. Should Americans be braced for an economic comeback that is going to take not months, but a year or more? You have two minutes to answer uninterrupted.\nMike Pence: (26:43)\nWhen President Trump and I took office, America had gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was when Joe Biden was vice president, they tried to tax and spend, and regulate, and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue collar, hardworking Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trump’s tax cuts. But America, you just heard Senator Harris tell you, on day one, Joe Biden’s going to raise your taxes. It’s really remarkable to think-\nKamala Harris: (27:28)\nThat’s not what I said.\nMike Pence: (27:29)\nI mean, right after a time where we’re going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we’ve already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes, rolled back regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade and secured four trillion dollars from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, save 50 million jobs through the Paycheck Protection Program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a two trillion dollar Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish [silence 00:08:13-00:28:41] … the American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth and opportunity.\nSusan Page: (28:46)\nThank you-\nMike Pence: (28:47)\n… and four more years of president Donald Trump, 2021-\nSusan Page: (28:50)\nThank you, Vice President-\nMike Pence: (28:51)\n… is going to be the biggest economic year in the history of this country.\nSusan Page: (28:53)\nThank you, Vice President Pence, Senator Harris.\nKamala Harris: (28:56)\nWell, I mean, I thought we saw enough of it in last week’s debate, but I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth and the truth and the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear, he will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year.\nMike Pence: (29:08)\nHe said he’s going to repeal the Trump tax cuts.\nKamala Harris: (29:10)\nMr. Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking.\nMike Pence: (29:14)\nThe important [inaudible 00:29:15] is you said the truth. Joe Biden has said it twice in the debate last week that he’s going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every single year-\nKamala Harris: (29:28)\nThat is-\nMike Pence: (29:28)\nSenator, that’s the math.\nKamala Harris: (29:30)\nThat is absolutely not true, [crosstalk 00:00:29:32].\nMike Pence: (29:32)\nIs he the only going to repeal part of the Trump tax cuts?\nKamala Harris: (29:35)\nIf you don’t mind letting me finish, we can then have a conversation, okay?\nMike Pence: (29:39)\nPlease.\nKamala Harris: (29:39)\nOkay. Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking, he has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who, during the great recession was responsible for the Recovery Act that brought America back. And now that Trump-\nKamala Harris: (30:03)\n… for the Recovery Act that brought America back, and now the Trump-Pence administration wants to take credit when they rode the coattails of Joe Biden’s success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term. Of course, now the economy is a complete disaster, but Joe Biden on the one hand did that. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression.\nKamala Harris: (30:28)\nOn the one hand, you have Joe Biden who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought healthcare to over 20 million Americans and protected people with preexisting conditions. And what it also did is it saved those families who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who is in court right now, trying to get rid of-\nMike Pence: (30:54)\nSusan, please [crosstalk 00:30:54]\nSusan Page: (30:54)\nThank you, Senator Harris.\nKamala Harris: (30:54)\n… trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections if you have preexisting conditions. And I just, this is very important, Susan. [crosstalk 00:31:03]\nSusan Page: (31:03)\nYes, but we need to give Vice President Pence his time.\nKamala Harris: (31:06)\nHe interrupted me, and I’d like to just finish, please. If you have a preexisting condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they’re coming for you. If you love someone who has a pre-existing condition [crosstalk 00:01:21], they’re coming for you. If you are under the age of 26 on your parents’ coverage, they’re coming for you.\nSusan Page: (31:26)\nSenator Harris, thank you.\nKamala Harris: (31:28)\nYou’re welcome.\nSusan Page: (31:28)\nLet me give you a chance to respond.\nMike Pence: (31:29)\nWell. I hope we have a chance to talk about healthcare because Obamacare was a disaster, and the American people remember it well. And President Trump and I have a plan to improve healthcare and protect preexisting conditions for every American. But look, Senator Harris, you’re entitled to your own opinion, but you’re not entitled to your own facts. You yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president, that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked at a supporter in the eye and pointed and said, “I guarantee, I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels.”\nMike Pence: (32:06)\nThey have a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, Susan, that your newspaper, USA Today, said really wasn’t that very different from the original Green New Deal. More taxes, more regulation, banning fracking, abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender to China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing, the V-shape recovery that’s underway right now will continue with four more years of President Donald Trump [crosstalk 00:32:37]\nSusan Page: (32:37)\nThank you very much Vice President Pence. Once again, you’ve provided the perfect segue to a new topic, which is climate change. And Vice President Pence, I’d like to pose the first question to you. This year, we’ve seen record-setting hurricanes in the South. Another one, Hurricane Delta, is now threatening the Gulf, and we have seen record-setting wildfires in the West. Do you believe as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter, and more deadly and have made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\nMike Pence: (33:15)\nThank you, Susan. Well, first, I’m very proud of our record on the environment, on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. Our water is among the cleanest in the world. And just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act. It’s the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment.\nMike Pence: (33:44)\nNow with regard to climate change, the climate is changing, but the issue is what’s the cause and what do we do about it? President Trump has made it clear that we’re going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They’d impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy costs of American families in their homes, and literally would crush American jobs.\nMike Pence: (34:13)\nAnd President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong, free market economy. What’s remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we’ve done it through innovation. And we’ve done it through natural gas and fracking, which Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning of fracking.\nMike Pence: (34:53)\nAnd so by creating the kind of American innovation, we’re actually steering toward a stronger and better environment. With regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center. And even Governor Gavin Newsom from your state has agreed, we’ve got to work on forest management. And with regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually as difficult as they are, there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago-\nSusan Page: (35:23)\nThank you [crosstalk 00:35:24]\nMike Pence: (35:24)\n… but many of the climate alarmists-\nSusan Page: (35:26)\nVice President Pence, I’m sorry, your time is up.\nMike Pence: (35:26)\n… use hurricanes and wildfires to try and sell the goods of a Green New Deal. And President Trump and I are going to always put-\nSusan Page: (35:33)\nThank you, Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (35:34)\n… American jobs and American workers first.\nSusan Page: (35:36)\nSenator Harris, as the vice president mentioned, you co-sponsored the Green New Deal in Congress, but Vice President Biden said in last week’s debate that he does not support the Green New Deal. But if you look at the Biden-Harris campaign website, it describes the Green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden-Harris administration toward the Green New Deal? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\nKamala Harris: (36:02)\nSo, first of all, I will repeat and the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden’s economic plan… Moody’s, which is a reputable Wall Street firm, has said will create seven million more jobs than Donald Trump’s.\nKamala Harris: (36:38)\nAnd part of those jobs that will be created by Joe Biden are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because, you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods.\nKamala Harris: (37:07)\nAnd so Joe believes, again, in science. I’ll tell you something, Susan, I served when I first got to the Senate on the committee that’s responsible for the environment. Do you know, this administration took the word science off the website, and then took the phrase climate change off the website? We have seen a pattern with this administration, which is they don’t believe in science. And Joe’s plan is about saying we’re going to deal with it, but we’re also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California, and the question was, the science is telling us this… You know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn’t know.\nKamala Harris: (37:43)\nSo let’s talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we’re going to invest that in renewable energy, which is going to be about the creation of millions of jobs. We will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035. Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the Climate Agreement with pride.\nSusan Page: (38:16)\nSenator Harris just said that climate change is an existential threat. Vice President Pence, do you believe that climate change poses an existential threat?\nMike Pence: (02:09)\nAs I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We’ll follow the science. But once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they’re going to raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week, that on day one, he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first Senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the green new deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out. The Green New Deal is on their campaign website.\nMike Pence: (02:54)\nAnd as USA TODAY said, it’s essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the Senator say that she’s going to resubmit America to the Paris climate accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment and will continue to cherish it. We’ve made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas through fracking. We don’t need a massive $2 trillion Green New Deal that would impose all new mandates on American businesses and American families.\nSusan Page: (03:30)\nThank you.\nMike Pence: (03:30)\nJoe Biden wants us to retrofit-\nSusan Page: (03:32)\nThank you Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (03:32)\nFour million business-\nSusan Page: (03:34)\nThank you Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (03:35)\nBuildings. It makes no sense. It will cost jobs. President Trump-\nSusan Page: (03:39)\nThank you Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (03:40)\nHe’s going to put America first. He’s going to put jobs first and we’re going to take care of our environment and follow the science.\nSusan Page: (03:45)\nThank you Vice President-\nKamala Harris : (03:46)\nWell, on the issue of jobs.\nSusan Page: (03:47)\nSenator Harris.\nKamala Harris : (03:47)\nLet’s talk about that. The vice-president earlier referred to it as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment. The president’s trade war with China. You lost that trade war. You lost it. What ended up happening is because of a so-called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession because of it. And when we look at where this administration has been, there are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration and the American people know what I’m talking about.\nKamala Harris : (04:39)\nI think about 20 year olds, we have a 20 something year old who are coming out of high school and college right now. And you’re wondering, is there going to be a job there for me? We’re looking at people who are trying to figure out how they’re going to pay rent by the end of the month, almost half of American renters are worried about whether they’re going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now. And it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration.\nSusan Page: (05:14)\nThank you Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you just 15 seconds to respond because then I want to move on.\nMike Pence: (05:18)\nWell, I’d love to respond. Look, lost the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China over the last several decades. And again, Senator Harris, you’re entitled to your opinion. You’re not entitled to your own facts. When Joe Biden was vice-president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And president Obama said they were never coming back. He said, we needed a magic wand to bring them back. In our first three years after we cut taxes-\nSusan Page: (05:48)\nThank you Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (05:50)\nRoll back regulation, unleashed American energy. This administration saw 500,000 manufacturing-\nSusan Page: (05:54)\nThank you Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (05:54)\nJobs created, and that’s exactly the kind of growth we’re going to continue to see as we bring our nation through-\nSusan Page: (06:00)\nThank you Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (06:00)\nThis pandemic.\nKamala Harris : (06:00)\nListen-\nMike Pence: (06:02)\nA Green New Deal-\nSusan Page: (06:02)\nThank you Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (06:02)\nYou’re passing new mandates, your Paris Climate Accord. It’s going to kill jobs this time, just like it killed jobs-\nKamala Harris : (06:08)\nI just need to respond very quickly.\nMike Pence: (06:10)\n15 seconds.\nKamala Harris : (06:11)\nThank you-\nMike Pence: (06:11)\nAnd then we move on.\nKamala Harris : (06:11)\nThank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America’s auto industry and you voted against it. So let’s set the record straight. Thank you.\nSusan Page: (06:23)\nI’d like to talk about China. We have as our next topic, we have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China. It is a huge market for American agricultural goods. It’s a potential partner in dealing with climate change in North Korea and in a video tonight, President Trump again, blamed it for the Coronavirus saying China will pay. Vice President Pence, how would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You have two minutes.\nMike Pence: (06:57)\nThank you, Susan. Well, before I leave that, let me speak to voting records if I can. Everybody knows that NAFTA costs literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go South of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA. In the United States, Mexico and Canada the agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But Senator you said it didn’t go far enough on climate change, you put your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and a head of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that it’s probably why Newsweek magazine said that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate.\nMike Pence: (08:06)\nSo now with regard to China, Susan first and foremost, China is to blame for the coronavirus and President Trump is not happy about it. He’s made that very clear, made it clear again today that China and the world health organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the Coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump in dealing with China from the outset of this administration, standing up to China that had been taking advantage of America for decades in the wake of Joe Biden’s cheerleading for China. President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know Joe Biden opposed President Trump’s decision to suspend all travel from China. He said it was hysterical. He said it was-\nSusan Page: (09:00)\nThank you Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (09:02)\nThe President Trump has stood up-\nSusan Page: (09:03)\nVice President Pence, your time is up.\nMike Pence: (09:04)\nTo China. We’re going to continue to stand strong.\nSusan Page: (09:06)\nThank you Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (09:07)\nWe want to improve the relationship, but we’re going to level the playing field and we’re going to hold China accountable-\nSusan Page: (09:12)\nVice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (09:12)\nfor what they did to America with the coronavirus.\nSusan Page: (09:13)\nThank you. Senator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked the vice-president. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Are we competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You’ll have two minutes uninterrupted.\nKamala Harris : (09:29)\nSusan, the Trump administration’s perspective and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs, and America’s standing. There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created within the White House and office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got rid of it.\nMike Pence: (10:09)\nNot true.\nKamala Harris : (10:10)\nThere was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Let’s look at the job situation. We mentioned before, the trade deal, the trade war, they wanted to call it with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs and a manufacturing recession and the American consumer paid thousands of dollars, more for goods because of that failed war that they called it. Then let’s talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold in greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping the head of the Chinese communist party than they do Donald Trump. The President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today because of a failure of leadership by this administration.\nSusan Page: (11:33)\nSenator Harris, we’ve seen changes in the role of the United States in terms of global leadership over the past four years. And of course times do change. What’s your definition? We’ve seen strains with China, of course, as the vice president mentioned, we’ve seen strange with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere. What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020?\nKamala Harris : (11:59)\nSo I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues and Joe, I think he said it quite well. He says, “Foreign policy, it might sound complicated, but really it’s relationships.” Just think about it as relationships. So we know this in our personal and professional relationships, you got to keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who’ve stood with, you got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world.\nKamala Harris : (12:41)\nLet’s take for example, Russia. So I serve on the intelligence committee of the United States Senate. America’s Intelligence Community told us Russia interfered in the election of the president of the United States in 2016 and his plan in 2020. Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI said the same, but Donald Trump, the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American Intelligence Community. You look at our friends at NATO, he has walked away from agreements.\nKamala Harris : (13:18)\nYou can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal guys. We were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends, with allies around the country. And because of Donald Trump’s unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan it’s about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation in addition to our great military has been that we keep our word, but Donald Trump doesn’t understand that because he doesn’t understand what it means to be honest.\nSusan Page: (14:03)\nThank you.\nKamala Harris : (14:03)\nHe doesn’t understand what it means to be honest.\nSusan Page: (14:03)\nThank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you a chance to respond.\nMike Pence: (14:09)\nThank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and they never did. We stood strong with our allies, but we’ve been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before thanks to President Trump’s leadership. We’ve strengthened our alliances across the Asia Pacific, and we’ve stood strong against those who would do us harm. When President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the middle East, the size of Pennsylvania, but President Trump unleashed the American military and our armed forces destroy the ISIS caliphate and took down their leader, al-Baghdadi without one American casualty. Al-Baghdadi was responsible for the death of thousands, but notably America’s hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller. Her parents, which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller’s murder were brought to justice in the United States.\nMike Pence: (15:22)\nJihadi John was killed on the battlefield along with the other beetle. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the oval office, presented a plan, they said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused or mercilessly before they killed her, but when Joe Biden was Vice President they hesitated for a month, and when armed forces finally went in, it was clear she’d been moved two days earlier. And her family says with a heart that broke the heart of every American, that if president Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today.\nSusan Page: (16:06)\nThank you, Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (16:06)\nSo, if we destroy the ISIS caliphate and you talk about re-entering the Iran nuclear deal. I mean the last administration transferred $1.8 billion to the leading state sponsor of terrorism.\nSusan Page: (16:20)\nThank you, Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (16:20)\nPresident Donald Trump got us out of the deal-\nSusan Page: (16:22)\nThank you, Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (16:24)\n… And when Qassem Soleimani was traveling to Baghdad-\nSusan Page: (16:26)\nThank you, Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (16:27)\n… To do harm to Americans, President Donald Trump took him out-\nSusan Page: (16:31)\nThank you, Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (16:31)\n… And America is safer, our allies are safer and the American people know president Donald Trump will never take action [crosstalk 00:00:16:40].\nSusan Page: (16:40)\nThank you, Vice President Pence. I would like to give Senator Harris a chance to respond, but not at such great length, because of course there are other topics we want to talk about.\nKamala Harris : (16:45)\nBut I would like equal time.\nSusan Page: (16:46)\nYes.\nKamala Harris : (16:47)\nThank you.\nSusan Page: (16:47)\nPlease go ahead.\nKamala Harris : (16:49)\nFirst of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter’s case, and I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. What happened to her is awful and it should have never happened, and I know Joe feels the same way, and I know that president Obama feels the same way, but you mentioned Soleimani. Let’s start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq, and they suffered serious brain injuries, and do you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump’s where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington cemetery and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, “What’s in it for them?” Because of course, he only thinks about what’s in it for him. Let’s take what he said about John McCain, a great American hero, and Donald Trump says, “He doesn’t deserve to be called a hero because it was a prisoner of war.”\nKamala Harris : (18:18)\nTake, and this is very important when you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief and what they care about and what they don’t care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers. And you know what a bounty is? It’s somebody puts a price on your head and they will pay it if you are killed, and Donald Trump had talked at least six times to Vladimir Putin and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that.\nSusan Page: (18:51)\nThank you-\nKamala Harris : (18:53)\nBut Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety.\nSusan Page: (19:07)\nThank you, Senator Harris. This is such an important issue, but we have other important issues as well. And I want to make sure we have a chance to talk about-\nMike Pence: (19:13)\nI really have to respond to that. She has-\nSusan Page: (19:16)\n15 seconds, because we’re trying to keep-\nMike Pence: (19:19)\nWell, I’ve got to have more then that. Look-\nSusan Page: (19:19)\nI’m sorry, Vice President, but you’ve had more time than she said so far-\nMike Pence: (19:23)\nSlanders against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd.\nSusan Page: (19:31)\nI’m sorry, Vice President Pence-\nMike Pence: (19:31)\nMy son is in captain in the United States Marine Corps. My son-in-law’s deployed in the United States Navy. I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military, President Donald Trump, not only respects, but reveres all of those who serve in our armed forces and any suggestion, otherwise is ridiculous. Let me also say the American people deserve to know-\nSusan Page: (19:54)\nVice President Pence, I didn’t not create the rules for tonight-\nMike Pence: (19:59)\n… Joe Biden [crosstalk 00:20:00].\nSusan Page: (20:00)\n… You’re campaigns agreed to the rules for tonight’s debate with the commission on president’s race. I’m here to enforce them, which involves moving from one topic to another giving roughly equal time to both of you, which is what I’m trying very hard to do.\nMike Pence: (20:13)\nGo right ahead.\nSusan Page: (20:14)\nSo, I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is an important one as the last topic was, and that is the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme court. Senator Harris, you’ll be there as a member of the committee.\nKamala Harris : (20:32)\nYes.\nSusan Page: (20:32)\nHer confirmation would submit the court’s conservative majority and make it likely open to more abortion restrictions, even to overturning the landmark Roe V Wade ruling. Access to abortion would then be up to the States. Vice President Pence, you’re the former governor of Indiana. If Roe V Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do? Would you want your home state to ban all abortions? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\nMike Pence: (21:00)\nWell, thank you for the question, but I’ll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before. The American people deserve to know Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian general was responsible for the death of hundreds of American service members. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans. President Trump didn’t hesitate and Qassem Soleimani is gone, but you deserve to know the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Qassem Soleimani. it’s really inexplicably, but with regard to Joe Biden, it’s explainable because history records a Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against a Osama bin Ladin. It’s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American service members, and that’s what you have in President Donald Trump.\nMike Pence: (21:56)\nNow with regard to the Supreme court-\nMike Pence: (22:09)\n[Silence].\nMike Pence: (22:10)\n… become Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and she’s a brilliant woman and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizeable American family to the Supreme court of the United States, and our hope is in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Cavenaugh received with treatment from you and others, that we hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don’t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. I mean, the Democrat chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the court of appeals, expressed concern that the dogma of her faith lived loudly and her, and Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees you actually attacked, because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. Just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views-\nSusan Page: (23:06)\nThank you, Vice President. Your time is up.\nMike Pence: (23:07)\n… And [crosstalk 00:23:06]. So, my hope is that when the hearing takes place that-\nSusan Page: (23:09)\nThank you, Vice President Pence.\nMike Pence: (23:09)\n… That Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respectfully voted and confirmed into the Supreme court of the United States.\nSusan Page: (23:17)\nThank you, Vice President Pence. Thank you. Senator Harris, you’re the Senator from and former Attorney General of California. So, let me ask you a parallel question to the one I posed to the Vice President. If Roe V Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do? Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion? And you have two minutes uninterrupted.\nKamala Harris : (23:37)\nThank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith, and it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe, if elected, will be only the second practicing Catholic as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination, Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people, we are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next President of the United States, and before, when this conversation has come up, it’s been about election year or election time. We’re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so, Joe has been very clear, as the American people are, let the American people fill that seat in the White House. And then we’ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme court, and to your point, Susan, the issues before us, couldn’t be more serious. There’s the issue of choice and I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body.\nKamala Harris : (24:48)\nIt should be her decision and not that Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence, but let’s also look at what else is before the court. It’s the Affordable Care Act like literally in the midst of a public health pandemic when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a preexisting condition because you contracted the virus. Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and I said it before, and it bears repeating. This means that there will be no more protections if they win for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you’re under the age of 26, you can’t stay on your parents’ coverage anymore, and here’s the thing. The contrast couldn’t be more clear. They’re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\nSusan Page: (25:47)\nThank you, Senator-\nKamala Harris : (25:47)\nJoe Biden is saying let’s expand coverage. Let’s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage. Let’s bring down premiums-\nSusan Page: (25:55)\nThank you Senator Harris.\nKamala Harris : (25:55)\n… Let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60.\nSusan Page: (25:57)\nThank you, Senator Harris.\nKamala Harris : (25:58)\nThat’s true leadership.\nSusan Page: (26:00)\nYou’ve mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the president was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions, but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration supporting that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. The president says, President Trump says that he’s going to protect people with preexisting conditions, but he has not explained how he would do that, and that was one of the toughest nuts to crack when they were passing the Affordable Care Act. So, tell us specifically, how would your administration protect Americans with preexisting conditions to have access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down?\nMike Pence: (26:41)\nWell, thank you, Susan, but let me just say, addressing your very first question. I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it, and this is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. Late term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. For our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States, but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden going to pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there’ve been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years from George Washington to Barack Obama.\nMike Pence: (27:42)\nPresidents have nominated in all 29 cases, but your party is actually openly advocating, adding seats to the Supreme court, which has had nine seats for 150 years if you don’t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can’t win by the rules, you’re going to change the rules. Now you’ve refused to answer the question. Joe Biden has refused to answer the question-\nMike Pence: (28:03)\nNo, you’ve refused to answer the question. Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. So I think the American people would really like to know if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed at the Supreme Court of the United States. Are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\nKamala Harris : (28:18)\nI’m so glad we went through a little history lesson. Let’s do that a little more. In 1864-\nMike Pence: (28:25)\nNo, I’d like you to answer the question.\nSusan Page: (28:25)\nYes, she’s-\nKamala Harris : (28:26)\nMr. Vice President, I’m speaking, I’m speaking. Okay. In 1864, one of the, I think political heroes, certainly the President, I assume you also, Mr. Vice President, is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection and it was 27 days before the election. And a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln’s party was in charge, not only of the White House, but the Senate. But Honest Aid said, “It’s not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land.” And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now and it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime.\nSusan Page: (29:29)\nThank you. Senator Harris-\nMike Pence: (29:30)\nPeople, Susan, are voting right now. They’d like to know if you and Joe Biden are going to pack the Supreme Court if you don’t get your way in this nomination.\nKamala Harris : (29:39)\nLet’s talk about packing-\nMike Pence: (29:40)\nYou, once again, gave a non-answer. Joe Biden gave a non-answer.\nKamala Harris : (29:44)\nI’m trying to answer you now.\nMike Pence: (29:45)\nYou know the people deserve a straight answer, and if you haven’t figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. Men and women, I got to tell you people across this country, if you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden Harris ticket come November the third, reelect President Donald Trump, and we’ll stand by that separation powers in a nine seats Supreme Court.\nKamala Harris : (30:09)\nYeah. Let’s talk about packing the court then. Let’s talk about the fact.\nMike Pence: (30:12)\nPlease.\nKamala Harris : (30:13)\nYeah, I’m about to. So the Trump Pence administration has been, because I sit on the Senate judiciary committee, Susan as you mentioned, and I’ve witnessed the appointments for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, courts of appeal, people who are purely ideological, people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found who have been not competent are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the court of appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is black? This is what they’ve been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let’s have that discussion.\nSusan Page: (30:59)\nAll right. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Let’s go on and talk about the issue of racial justice.\nMike Pence: (31:04)\nI just want the record to reflect she never answered the question. Maybe in the next debate Joe Biden will answer the question, but I think the American people know the answer.\nSusan Page: (31:12)\nThank you, Vice President. In March, Breonna Taylor, a 26 year old emergency room technician in Louisville was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant in an aquatics investigation, broke into her apartment. The police said they identified themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend said he didn’t hear them do that. He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer. The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment. They say they were acting in self-defense. None of them have been indicted in connection with her death. Senator Harris, in the case of Breonna Taylor was justice done? You have two minutes.\nKamala Harris : (31:53)\nI don’t believe so. And I’ve talked with Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer and her family and her family deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what’s going on out on the street so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken justifiably and tragically and violently. And it brings me to the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed uniformed police officer. And people around our country of every race, of every age, of every gender, perfect strangers to each other, marched shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests.\nKamala Harris : (33:08)\nAnd I believe strongly that first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the fight to achieve our ideals. And that’s why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I’m a former career prosecutor. I know what I’m talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban choke holes and carotid holes. George Floyd would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law. We will, on the issue of criminal justice reform, get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana.\nSusan Page: (33:59)\nThank you. Thank you, Senator Harris.\nKamala Harris : (33:59)\nAnd we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana. This is a time for leadership-\nSusan Page: (34:05)\nThank you, Senator Harris.\nKamala Harris : (34:05)\non a tragic, tragic issue-\nSusan Page: (34:08)\nSenator Harris, your time is up.\nKamala Harris : (34:08)\nOf honor on Black people in America who [crosstalk 00:34:11].\nSusan Page: (34:10)\nThank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me pose the same question to you. In the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\nMike Pence: (34:23)\nWell, our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American life and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies. But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that refuse the evidence. And it really is remarkable that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that an impaneled grand jury looking at all the evidence, got it wrong. But you’re entitled to your opinion, Senator. I think, and with regard to George Floyd, there’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served, but there’s also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake city. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, it was burned to the ground by rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together.\nMike Pence: (35:27)\nAnd I must tell you, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist, and that as Joe Biden said that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, President Trump and I stand with you. And it is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats, Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room and then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott’s bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new repeat resources. We don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement, proving public safety and supporting our African-American neighbors and all of our minorities. Under President Trump’s leadership-\nSusan Page: (36:33)\nThank you, Vice President.\nMike Pence: (36:33)\nWe’ll always stand with law enforcement and we’ll do what we’ve done-\nSusan Page: (36:36)\nVice President Pence, thank you. Your time is up.\nMike Pence: (36:38)\nFrom day one, it is improve the lives of African-Americans, record unemployment, record investments in education.\nSusan Page: (36:43)\nThank you, Vice President Pence. Vice President Pence, your time is up.\nMike Pence: (36:44)\nWe’ll fight for school choice for all of [crosstalk 00:36:46].\nKamala Harris : (36:46)\nI’d like to respond.\nSusan Page: (36:48)\nSenator Harris.\nKamala Harris : (36:49)\nI will not sit here and be lectured by the Vice President on what it means to enforce the laws of our country. The only one on this stage, who has personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assault to homicide. I’m the only one on this stage who has prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of America’s homeowners. I am the only one on this stage who prosecuted for-profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans.\nKamala Harris : (37:16)\nAnd the reality of this is that we are talking about an election in 27 days where last week the President of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists.\nMike Pence: (37:31)\nNot. Not true.\nKamala Harris : (37:32)\nAnd it wasn’t like he didn’t have a chance. He didn’t do it. And then he doubled down. And then he said, “when pressed, stand back, stand by.” And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump’s. He called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He instituted as his first act, a Muslim ban. He on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed. And on the other side, there were neo-Nazis carrying Tiki torches, shouting racial epithets, anti-Semitic slurs. And Donald Trump when asked about it said, “There were fine people on both sides.” This is who we have as the President of the United States and America, you deserve better. Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together-\nSusan Page: (38:38)\nSenator Harris.\nKamala Harris : (38:39)\nAnd recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us.\nSusan Page: (38:46)\nVice President let me give you a minute to respond.\nMike Pence: (38:49)\nThank you, Susan. I appreciate that very much. I think this is one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country, Susan, is that you selectively edit just like Senator Harris did, comments that President Trump and I and others on our side made. I mean, Senator Harris conveniently admitted after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly. You’re concerned that he doesn’t condemn neo-Nazis. President Trump has Jewish grandchildren. His daughter and son-in-law are Jewish. This is a President who respects and cherishes all of the American people.\nMike Pence: (39:37)\nBut you talk about having personally prosecuted. I’m glad you brought up your record, Senator.\nSusan Page: (39:40)\nThank you.\nMike Pence: (39:42)\nI really need to make this point. When you were DA in San Francisco, when you left office, African-Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of blacks in California.\nSusan Page: (40:04)\nThank you.\nMike Pence: (40:04)\nYou did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn’t lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill. I mean, the reality is your record speaks for itself.\nSusan Page: (40:15)\nThank you Vice President.\nMike Pence: (40:15)\nPresident Trump and I have fought for criminal justice before-\nSusan Page: (40:18)\nThank you Vice President.\nMike Pence: (40:19)\nWe fought for educational choice and opportunities for African-Americans and all of our members.\nSusan Page: (40:23)\nThank you, sir.\nMike Pence: (40:24)\nAnd we’ll do it for four more years.\nSusan Page: (40:25)\nThank you. There is no more important issue than the final issue that we’re going to talk about tonight and that is the issue of the election itself.\nKamala Harris : (40:33)\nBut he attacked my record. I would like an opportunity to respond to.\nSusan Page: (40:35)\nLet me give you 30 seconds because we’re running out of time.\nKamala Harris : (40:39)\nI appreciate that. First of all, having served as the Attorney General of the state of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do, and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. It will be about not only instituting a ban on choke holes and carotid holes-\nSusan Page: (41:06)\nThank you. Thank you Senator Harris.\nKamala Harris : (41:07)\nI would like to go through-\nSusan Page: (41:09)\nThese are points that you made earlier in the hour. And I want to talk about the election itself before we have to [crosstalk 00:41:13].\nKamala Harris : (41:13)\nBut I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do in my record, which includes I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full-time. We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias because yes, Joe Biden and I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe. We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in re-entry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward. And again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America.\nSusan Page: (42:03)\nThank you, Senator-\nKamala Harris : (42:03)\nAnd a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America.\nSusan Page: (42:03)\nThank you, Senator Harris. And I’d like you to respond first to the question on our final topic, the election itself. President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If your ticket wins and president Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and vice president Biden then take? What would happen next? You have two minutes.\nKamala Harris : (42:31)\nSo I’ll tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition that we’ve built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalitions of folks that you’ve ever seen in a presidential race. Of course, we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans. In fact, seven members of president George W. Bush’s cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich. Over 500 generals, retired generals and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House. We believe in the American people, we believe in our democracy, and here’s what I’d like to say to everybody. Vote, please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to Iwillvote.com. You can also go to Joebiden.com.\nKamala Harris : (43:44)\nWe have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power, and if we use our vote and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when, again, in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage, because clearly Donald Trump doesn’t think he can run on a record because it’s a failed record, Joe Biden on that stage said, Hey, just please vote. So I’ll repeat what Joe said. Please vote.\nSusan Page: (44:31)\nThank you, Senator. Vice president Pence, president Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If vice president Biden is declared the winner and president Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as vice president? What would you personally do? You have two minutes.\nMike Pence: (44:55)\nWell, Susan, first and foremost, I think we’re going to win this election. Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany of the establishment in Washington, DC and establishment that Joe Biden’s been a part of for 47 years, president Donald Trump has as launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this president’s record where we rebuild our military. We revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day. And I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years.\nMike Pence: (45:44)\nBut when you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you. Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It’s amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on president Trump and my campaign. I mean, there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI, documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign. And of course, we’ve all seen the avalanche, what you put the country through for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that, in her words, under no circumstances, should he concede the election.\nMike Pence: (46:46)\nSo let me just say, I think we’re going to win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail in voting that’ll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. And we have a free and fair election. We know we’re going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that president Donald Trump is going to be reelected for four more years.\nSusan Page: (47:09)\nI’ve written all the questions that I’ve asked tonight, but for the final question of the debate, I’d like to read a question that someone else wrote. The Utah Debate Commission asked students in the state to write essays about what they would like to ask you. And I want to close tonight’s debate with the question posed by [Brecklin 00:47:29] Brown. She’s an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah. And here’s what she wrote. “When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans. When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen. When I watch the news, all I see are two candidates from opposing parties trying to tear each other down. If our leaders can’t get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along?” And then she added, “Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together.” So to each of you in turn, I’d like you to take one minute and respond to Brecklin. Vice president Pence, you have one minute.\nMike Pence: (48:13)\nBrecklin, it’s a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for taking an interest in public life. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that. It’s how we’ve created literally the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. I would tell you that, don’t assume that what you’re seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people.\nMike Pence: (48:53)\nI look at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites on the Supreme Court of the United States. One very liberal one, very conservative. But what’s been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. Here in America, we can disagree. We can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on this stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. And that’s what people do, in big cities and small towns all across this country. So I just want to encourage you, Brecklin. I want to tell you that we’re going to work every day to have government as good as our people, and the American people each and every day. Love a good debate. We love a good argument. But we always come together and are always there for one another in times of need. And we’ve especially learned that through the difficulties of this year.\nSusan Page: (49:51)\nThank you, vice president. Senator Harris, what would you say to Brecklin?\nKamala Harris : (49:58)\nFirst of all, I love hearing from our young leaders. And when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklin, I know our future is bright because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be that is a sign of leadership, and is something we should all aspire to be.\nKamala Harris : (50:17)\nAnd brings me to Joe, Joe Biden. One of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier. It so troubled him and upset him like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that over the course of the last four years, what Brecklin described has been happening.\nKamala Harris : (50:44)\nJoe has a longstanding reputation of working across the aisle, and working in a bipartisan way. And that’s what he’s going to do as president. Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You have to know Joe’s story to know that Joe has known pain. He has known suffering. And he has known love.\nKamala Harris : (51:10)\nBrecklin, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright. And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be because we fight for each person’s voice through their vote. And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work and through, eventually, your vote, to determine the future of our country and what its leadership looks like.\nSusan Page: (51:37)\nThank you, Senator Harris. Thank you, vice president Pence. Thank you so much for being with us tonight.\nSusan Page: (51:42)\nWe want to thank also the University of Utah for its hospitality. And most of all, our thanks to all the Americans who watched this debate tonight. Again, our best wishes for a quick recovery to president Trump, the First Lady, and everyone who is battling COVID-19. The second presidential debate is next week on October 15, a town hall style debate in Miami. We hope you’ll join us then. Good evening.",

         "Joe Biden: (03:15)\nThank you all for being here. Thank you. I appreciate you being here on this gorgeous day in a magnificent, magnificent setting, until you think about all the lives that were lost here. Please, all have a seat.\nJoe Biden: (03:39)\nOn July 4th, 1863, American woke to the remains of perhaps the most consequential battle in American soil. It took place here on this ground in Gettysburg; three days of violence, three days of carnage, 50,000 casualties, wounded, captured, missing, or dead, over three days of fighting. When the sun rose on that Independence Day, Lee would retreat. The war would go on for nearly two more years, but the back of the Confederacy had been broken. The Union would be saved. Slavery would be abolished, government of by and for the people would not perish from the earth, and freedom would be born anew in our land.\nJoe Biden: (04:41)\nThere’s no more fitting place than here today in Gettysburg, to talk about the cost of division. About how much it has cost America in the past, about how much it is costing us now, and about why I believe in this moment, we must come together as a nation. For President Lincoln, the Civil War was about the greatest of causes. The end of slavery, widening equality, pursuit of justice, the creation of opportunity, and the sanctity of freedom.\nJoe Biden: (05:20)\nHis words would live ever after. We hear them in our heads. We know them in our hearts. We draw on them when we seek hope in hours of darkness; “Four score, and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” Here on this sacred ground, Abraham Lincoln, re-imagined America itself. Here, a president of the United States spoke of the price of division, and the meaning of sacrifice.\nJoe Biden: (06:07)\nHe believed in the rescue, redemption, and rededication of the union. All this in a time, not just of ferocious division, but of widespread death, structural inequity, and fear of the future. And he taught us this, a house divided could not stand. That is a great and timeless truth. Today, once again, we are a house divided, but that my friends can no longer be. We’re facing too many crises. We have too much work to do. We have to bright a future to have it shipwrecked on the Shoals of anger and hate, and division.\nJoe Biden: (07:04)\nAs we stand here today, a century and a half later after Gettysburg, we should consider again, what can happen when equal justice is denied, when anger and violence and division are left unchecked. As I look across America today, I’m concerned. The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Too many Americans see our public life, not as an arena for mediation of our differences, but rather they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting, partisan warfare.\nJoe Biden: (07:49)\nInstead of treating each other’s party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I’ve been saying it for two years now, I’m accused of being naive. I’m told, “Maybe that’s the way things used to work, Joe, but they can’t work that way anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you they can, and they must if we’re going to get anything done.\nJoe Biden: (08:26)\nI’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me, as those who do. That’s the job of a president; the duty to care for everyone. It was a lot of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It’s a decision. It’s a choice we make.\nJoe Biden: (09:00)\nAnd if we can decide not to cooperate, we can decide to cooperate as well. That’s the choice I’ll make as president. But there’s something bigger going on in this nation than just our broken politics. Something darker, something more dangerous. I’m not talking about ordinary differences of opinion, competing viewpoints give life and vibrancy to our democracy. No, I’m talking about something different, something deeper. Too many Americans seek not to overcome our divisions, but to deepen them, we must seek not to build walls, but bridges. We must seek not to have our fist clenched, but our arms open. We have to seek not to tear each other apart, we seek to come together. You don’t have to agree with me on everything, or even on most things, to see that we’re experiencing today is neither good nor normal.\nJoe Biden: (10:14)\nI made the decision to run for president after Charlottesville. Close your eyes, and remember what you saw. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK coming out of the fields with torches light, veins bulging, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile herd across Europe in the ’30s. It was hate on the march, in the open, in America. Hate never goes away, it only hides. And when it’s given oxygen, when it’s given an opportunity to spread, when it’s treated as normal and acceptable behavior, we’ve opened a door in this country that we must move quickly to close. As president, that’s just what I will do. I will send a clear unequivocal message to the entire nation, there is no place for hate in America.\nJoe Biden: (11:20)\nIt will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It’ll be given no safe harbor. In recent weeks and months, the country has been riled by instances of excessive police force, heart-wrenching cases of racial injustice and lives needlessly and senselessly lost, by peaceful protesters, given voice to the calls for justice, by examples of violence and looting and burning that can not be tolerated. I believe in law and order, I’ve never supported defunding the police.\nJoe Biden: (11:57)\nBut I also believe injustice is real. It’s a product of a history that goes back 400 years, the moment when black men, women, and children first were brought here in chains. I do not believe we have to choose between law and order, and racial justice in America. We can have both. This is the nation strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses. The two often bear the brunt of this looting and burning.\nJoe Biden: (12:35)\nWe have no need for armed militias roaming America’s streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacy groups, menacing our communities. If you say, “We should trust America’s law enforcement authorities to do the job,” as I do, then let them do their job without extremist groups acting as vigilantes. If you say, “We have no need to face racial injustice in the country,” you haven’t opened your eyes to the truth in America.\nJoe Biden: (13:07)\nThere’ve been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months, George Floyd’s, six year old daughter, who I met with, who looked at me and said in her small child’s voice, “Daddy changed the world.” Also, Jacob Blake’s mother was another. When she said, “Violence didn’t reflect her son and this nation needed healing.” And Doc Rivers, the basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung. It’s amazing [inaudible 00:13:49] we keep loving this country and this country does not love us back.”\nJoe Biden: (13:55)\nI think about that. I think about what it takes for a black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country. That has for far too long, never been recognized. What we need in America’s leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open lines of communications, to bring us together, to heal, to hope. As president, that’s precisely what I will do. We paid a high price for allowing the deep divisions in this country to impact on how we deal with the Coronavirus. 210,000 Americans dead, and the number’s climbing. It’s estimated that nearly another 210,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year; enough, no more. Let’s just set partisanship aside, let’s end the politics and follow the science.\nJoe Biden: (14:58)\nWearing a mask is not a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation. Social distancing isn’t a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation. Testing, tracing, the development and all approval and distribution of a vaccine, isn’t a political statement. It is a science-based decision. We can’t undo what has been done. We can’t go back. We can do so much better. We can do better starting today. We can have a national strategy that puts politics aside and saves lives.\nJoe Biden: (15:40)\nWe can have a national strategy that will make it possible for our schools and business to open safely. We can have a national strategy that reflects the true values of this nation. This pandemic is not a red state or blue state issue. This virus doesn’t care whether you live, or where you live, what political party you belong to, it affects us all. It will take anyone’s life. It’s a virus. It’s not a political weapon.\nJoe Biden: (16:11)\nThere’s another enduring division in America that we must end, the division in our economic life. That gives opportunity only to the privileged few. America has to be about mobility. It has to be the kind of country where an Abraham Lincoln, a child of the distant frontier, can rise to the highest office in the land. America has to be about possibilities.\nJoe Biden: (16:38)\nThe possibility of prosperity, not just for the privileged few, but for the many, for all of us. Working people on their kids deserve an opportunity. Lincoln knew this. He said that the country had to give people, and I quote, “An open field and a fair chance. An open field and a fair chance.” That’s what we’re going to do in America. We’re going to build together. We fought a civil war that would secure a union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all.\nJoe Biden: (17:16)\nAnd by fits and starts, our better angels had prevailed again, just enough, just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation. And those better angels can prevail again, now. They must prevail again, now. 100 years after Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg, the vice president, Lyndon B Johnson also came here, and here’s what he said.\nJoe Biden: (17:46)\nHe said, “Our nation founded soul and honor in these fields of Gettysburg, we must not lose that soul in dishonor, now, on the fields of hate.” Today, we’re engaged, once again, in the battle for the soul of the nation, the forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down and holding us back. We must free ourselves of all of them. As president, I will embrace hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. And light, not darkness. I’ll be a president who appeals to the best in us, not the worst.\nJoe Biden: (18:38)\nI’ll be a president who pushes toward the future, not one who clings to the past. I’m ready to fight for you and for our nation every day, without exception, without reservation, with a full and devoted heart. We cannot, and will not, allow extremest and white supremacist to overturn the America of Lincoln and Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglas, to overturn the America that has welcomed immigrants from distant shores, to overturn the America that has been a Haven and a home for everyone, no matter their background.\nJoe Biden: (19:16)\nFrom Seneca falls to Selma, to Stonewall we’re at our best when the promise of America is available to all, we cannot, and we will not allow violence in the street to threaten the people of this nation. We cannot and will not walk away from our obligation to at long last, face the wrecking on race and racial justice in this country. We cannot and will not continue to be struck in the partisan politics that lets us, this virus, thrive, while the public health of this nation suffers.\nJoe Biden: (19:55)\nWe cannot and will not accept an economic equation that only favors those who have already got it made; everybody deserves a shot at prosperity. Folks, duty and history call presidents to provide for the common good, and I will. It won’t be easy. Won’t be easy. Our divisions today are long standing, economic and racial inequities have shaped us for generations, but I give you my word. I give you my word. If I’m elected president, I will Marshall the ingenuity and Goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together because I think people are looking for that. We can disagree about how as we move forward, we must take the first steps. It starts with how we treat one another. How we talk to one another. How we respect one another.\nJoe Biden: (21:04)\nIn the second inaugural Lincoln said, “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we’re in to build up the nation’s wounds, bind up the nation’s wounds.” Now, we have our work to reunite America. To bind up our nation’s wounds. To move past shadow and suspicion. And so we, you and I together, we press on, even now. After hearing the second inaugural address, Frederick Douglas told President Lincoln, “Mr. Lincoln, that was a sacred effort.” We have to be dedicated to our own sacred effort. The promise of Gettysburg and the new birth of freedom was in hand.\nJoe Biden: (22:04)\nI think it’s at risk. Every generation that’s followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment when it must answer this question, will they allow the sacrifices made here to be in vain, or be fulfilled? This is our moment to answer this essential American question, for ourselves and for our time. And my answer is this, it cannot be that after all this country has been through, after all that America’s accomplished, after all the years, we have stood as a beacon of light to the world.\nJoe Biden: (22:41)\nIt cannot be that here and now in 2020, we will allow the government of the people, by the people, and for the people to perish this earth. No, it cannot. And it must not. We have it in our hands, the ultimate power. The power to vote. Its the note instrument ever devised to register our will in a peaceable and productive fashion. And so we must. We must vote. We will vote. No matter how many obstacles are thrown in our way, because once America votes, America will be heard.\nJoe Biden: (23:24)\nLincoln said, “The nation is worth fighting for.” So it was. And so it is, together as one nation under God, indivisible. Let us join forces to fight the common foe of injustice and inequality, hate and fear. Let’s conduct ourselves as Americans who love each other, who love our country, who will not destroy, but will build. We owe it to the dead who were buried here at Gettysburg. We owe that to the living, and to future generations yet to be born.\nJoe Biden: (24:07)\nYou and I are part of a covenant, a common story of divisions overcome and hope renewed. If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other, then the divisions of our time will give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future. This is our work. This is our pledge. This is our mission. We can end this era of division. We can end the hate and the fear. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. We can do this.",

         "Michelle Obama: (02:12)\nBelieve it or not, the election is right around the corner. Votes are already being cast and if you’re still deciding who to vote for or whether to vote at all, I wanted to take a moment to remind you what’s at stake and to urge you to make a plan to vote today. Because let’s be honest, right now our country is in chaos because of a president who isn’t up to the job. If we want to regain any kind of stability, we’ve got to ensure that every eligible voter is informed and engaged in this election.\nMichelle Obama: (02:50)\nBecause the stakes are on display every day, not just in the headlines, but in our families. If you’re a parent like me, you’re feeling the consequences of this president’s failure to take this pandemic seriously. From his constant downplaying of the importance of masks and social distancing, to his relentless pressure on schools to open without offering a clear plan or meaningful support to keep students and teachers safe. Look, our daughters are in college now, and luckily, they’re taking classes from home this semester. But in just a few weeks since schools have resumed, many of their friends who returned to campus have either tested positive or are living with someone who has.\nMichelle Obama: (03:39)\nYes, it’s anecdotal, of course, and everybody wants their kids back in school as soon as it’s safe. But as a mom, it is frightening thinking about all these young people who were just our babies yesterday, quarantined alone in dorms or apartments with little or no support as the disease continues to spread, unable to come home if their symptoms get worse. Just imagine the toll that worry is taking on families across this country. Yes, thankfully there’s some relief in knowing that most cases in young people are mild and I pray every day that no one faces longer-term consequences to this disease, but the truth is we just don’t know yet and we simply cannot trust this president to tell us the truth about anything.\nMichelle Obama: (04:33)\nMeanwhile, parents with younger kids are dealing with another set of stresses, from grade-schoolers who want to learn but struggle to connect with their teacher through a screen, to schools that open and close with little advance notice, leaving everyone in an endless cycle of uncertainty. Too many parents are still juggling two jobs and multiple kids without any support, not to mention the millions of families anxious about making rent or getting internet access or affording childcare.\nMichelle Obama: (05:06)\nIt’s painful to think that months into this crisis, this is still where we are with no clear plan, no peace of mind and the worst part is it didn’t have to be like this. Look around the world. So many other countries aren’t experiencing this level of extended suffering and uncertainty. These countries were hit by the same viruses we were. They have the same kind of resources to contain it as we did, but what they didn’t have to contend with was this president. A man who had every resource at his disposal, the finest medical experts, our best intelligence, and yet ignored all the advice and failed to produce a plan to provide enough tests for worried families or protective equipment for our healthcare workers. A man who knew how deadly this virus is, but who lied to us and told us it would just disappear. Who in the greatest crisis of our lifetimes doubled down on division and resentment, railed against measures that could have mitigated the damage and continues to hold massive events without requiring masks or social distancing, knowingly exposing his own supporters to a dangerous virus.\nMichelle Obama: (06:35)\nToday, more Americans have died from this virus than died in the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and Korea combined. Take all those lives bravely sacrificed and double it. That is roughly the scale of this tragedy and our Commander-in-Chief, sadly, has been missing in action and his willful mismanagement of the COVID crisis is just one example of his negligence. When wildfires rage out west, he says nothing for weeks. When Americans of all backgrounds peacefully protest racism and police violence, he disparages them, yet eggs on heavily armed militias. When our heroic young men and women answer the call and give their lives for our country, he calls them suckers and losers and publicly mocks Gold Star families and prisoners of war. All this from someone who, as a wealthy, connected young man avoided military service. With millions and millions of Americans left reeling from the worst job losses in recent history, with small businesses closing their doors for good, he and his party dragged their feet to provide necessary relief for people whose lives have been decimated under his watch.\nMichelle Obama: (08:09)\nSeven months later, he still doesn’t have a plan for this virus. Seven months later, he still won’t wear a mask consistently and encourage others to do the same, even when those simple actions could save countless lives. Instead, he continues to gaslight the American people by acting like this pandemic is not a real threat. And yet, even in the face of all this incompetence, Americans keep digging deeper, finding new reserves of strength, doing whatever it takes to get through this. That’s one of the beautiful things that has given me hope over the past four years, our country’s resilience. From the essential workers keeping us safe, to the doctors and nurses caring for our loved ones, to the teachers and childcare workers doing everything they can for our kids. Americans have stepped up to answer the call. It’s not too much to ask our leaders to rise to the occasion as well.\nMichelle Obama: (09:23)\nThankfully, we have the chance to elect a president who can meet this moment, a leader who has the character and the experience to put an end to this chaos, start solving these problems and help lighten the load for families all across the country and that leader is Joe Biden. After seeing the presidency up close for eight years, maybe the most important thing I’ve learned about the job is this, how a president focuses their time and energy in office is a direct reflection of the life they’ve lived before entering the White House.\nMichelle Obama: (10:03)\nA president’s policies are a direct reflection of their values and we’re seeing that truth on display with our current president who has devoted his life to enriching himself, his family and other wealthy people he truly understands, cutting taxes for the rich and big corporations, cutting regulations that protect regular families from getting taken advantage of by people like him, cutting his friends loose from prison time. He boasts about gains in the stock market, but when you look at the lives of regular folks, whether it’s creating blue-collar jobs, making healthcare more affordable, protecting the environment, keeping our family safe from gun violence, let alone the coronavirus, there’s nothing much to brag about.\nMichelle Obama: (10:54)\nBy contrast, Joe Biden has lived his life guided by values and principles that mirror ones that most Americans can recognize. I know Joe. He is a good man who understands the struggles of everyday folks. When he was a kid, his dad lost his job. His family had to move to find work. As a young man, he quit his job at a lucrative law firm to serve as a public defender protecting the rights of those who couldn’t defend themselves.\nMichelle Obama: (11:31)\nHe continued to serve this country, even in the face of unimaginable tragedy, losing his wife and baby daughter, later in his life, his eldest son. Relying on his deep faith in God to carry him through, never growing cynical and always willing to see the humanity in us all. It is that spirit, that determination that will make Joe the kind of president we need right now, one who will continue to put the needs of the country before his own to ensure that all families can get back on their feet and our economy can get back on track.\nMichelle Obama: (12:18)\nHe’ll start by getting this virus under control, working with a broad coalition of leaders to develop a national strategy that will include mandatory mask wearing and free testing. He’ll get schools the resources they need to sort through this confusion. He will listen to doctors and scientists to make sure that any vaccine will be safe, effective and available to everyone. Joe Biden will also get back to work solving problems that this president has ignored or made worse these past four years. Joe will give working families a tax credit for childcare. He’ll roll back those tax cuts for the rich and instead help small businesses and working families. He’ll lower the cost of prescription drugs and give every American access to affordable health coverage. He’ll work to restore trust between police and communities of color and address the racial discrimination that has plagued us for far too long. He will protect our planet. He will invest in our schools and bring people together to get something done, even across our differences.\nMichelle Obama: (13:36)\nWe can trust Joe Biden to name Supreme Court justices who follow in the footsteps of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Judges who understand that justice and equality aren’t theoretical ideas, but concrete matters that affect our healthcare, our livelihoods and our bodies. This is the kind of leader our nation deserves, a leader who is tested and ready to dive right in, a leader who will lock arms with his terrific running mate, Kamala Harris, and bring us out of this downward spiral. A leader who will help heal this nation, and instead of tearing people apart, he will bring people together. It’s a simple choice, really. A chance for a fresh start or four more years of this.\nMichelle Obama: (14:37)\nBut let’s be very real, America is divided right now and a lot of people are being sold lies from those who want to get rich or stay in power or sometimes both. As I’ve said before, we must all empathize with those who might not look like us or vote like us. We have got to put ourselves in one another’s shoes. Look, think about it. You’ve worked hard all your life and for too long you’ve watched the rich get richer. You’ve lost your farms and your livelihoods to corporate greed. You’ve seen your beloved towns shattered by joblessness. You’ve watched families destroyed by drug addiction and mental health challenges, all of this long before this virus hit. It is frustrating to hear some folks say that you’ve been the beneficiary of privilege, that the color of your skin gives you a headstart. That is the reality for far too many hard working decent Americans.\nMichelle Obama: (15:45)\nBut right now, the President and his allies are trying to tap into that frustration and distract from his breathtaking failures by giving folks someone to blame other than them. They’re stoking fears about Black and Brown Americans, lying about how minorities will destroy the suburbs, whipping up violence and intimidation and they’re pinning it all on what’s been an overwhelmingly peaceful movement for racial solidarity. It’s true, research backs it up. Only a tiny fraction of demonstrations have had any violence at all.\nMichelle Obama: (16:28)\nSo, what the president is doing is, once again, patently false. It’s morally wrong and yes, it is racist, but that doesn’t mean it won’t work. Because this is it a difficult time, a confusing time and when people hear these lies and crazy conspiracies repeated over and over and over again, they don’t know what to think. With everything going on in their lives, they don’t have time to fact-check falsehoods being spread throughout the internet and even reasonable people might get scared. The one thing this president is really, really good at is using fear and confusion and spreading lies to win.\nMichelle Obama: (17:19)\nLook, I get it, but I also feel it. As a black woman who has, like the overwhelming majority of people of color in this nation, done everything in my power to live a life of dignity and service and honesty. The knowledge that any of my fellow Americans is more afraid of me than the chaos we are living through right now, well, that hurts. It hurts us all. It is a heaviness that sits on our hearts.\nMichelle Obama: (18:00)\nSo, I want to appeal for some empathy here too. I want everyone who is still undecided to think about all those folks like me and my ancestors, the moms and dads who worked their fingers to the bone to raise their kids right, the teenagers who wear hoodies while working hard to get their diplomas, the millions of folks who look like me and fought and died and toiled as slaves and soldiers and laborers to help build this country. Put yourselves in our shoes for just a moment. Imagine how it feels to wake up every day and do your very best to uphold the values that this country claims to hold dear, truth, honor, decency, only to have those efforts met by scorn, not just by your fellow citizens, but by a sitting president.\nMichelle Obama: (19:06)\nImagine how it feels to have suspicion cast on you from the day you were born, simply because of the hue of your skin, to walk around your own country scared that someone’s unjustified fear of you could put you in harm’s way, terrified of what four more years of this kind of division might mean for the safety of you and those you love. Living with the knowledge that no matter how hard we try, how much good we do in the world, there will be far too many who will never see our humanity, who will project on us their own fears of retribution for centuries of injustice and thus only see us as a threat to be restrained.\nMichelle Obama: (19:59)\nWe know what happens next, a racial slur from a passing car, a job promotion that never comes, a routine traffic stop gone wrong, maybe a knee to the neck. Racism, fear, division, these are powerful weapons and they can destroy this nation if we don’t deal with them head on. So, I want to ask every single American, no matter what party you normally vote for, to please take a moment to pause. Click off the news. Think about how you felt over these last four years, how quickly things have turned and then think about what next four years could mean for our country’s future, the message we will send to our children about who we are and what we truly value. Think about what would possibly compel you to accept this level of chaos, violence, and confusion under this president and be willing to watch our country continue to spiral out of control. Because we can no longer pretend that we don’t know exactly who and what this president stands for.\nMichelle Obama: (21:22)\nSearch your hearts and your conscience and then vote for Joe Biden like your lives depend on it. Look, you all know that politics has never been my thing, but to all the young people out there, to all the Black and Brown folks, to anyone who feels frustrated and alienated by this whole system, I get it. I really do. But in the face of all of the frustration and alienation I’ve experienced throughout my life, never once have I considered not voting as a viable option. Not once have I thought about foregoing a right and privilege that so many before me fought and died for. Not once have I let someone else’s ignorance and hatred keep me from doing my duty as a citizen, because I know we don’t have the luxury to assume that things are going to turn out okay. We cannot afford to withhold our votes or waste them on a protest candidate.\nMichelle Obama: (22:27)\nOne of these two men will be president and only if we vote for Joe Biden with power and with passion, will our voices even have a chance at being heard. Because folks who are perfectly content with the status quo, who are quite happy with what’s been going on these past four years, trust me, whether they say it out loud or not, they will vote too. So, we can expect that this election will be won by the slimmest of margins, just like four years ago. A handful of votes per precinct in Pennsylvania, or Arizona, or Wisconsin, or Florida, or anywhere else will make all the difference. So, we have got to make our plan to vote this instant. We’ve got to vote early so we have the peace of mind to know that our vote for Joe Biden is in the bank. We’ve got to go to IWillVote.com right now to request our absentee ballots and send them back immediately or take them to a drop-box or an election office.\nMichelle Obama: (23:34)\nIf we choose not to vote by mail, we’ve got to find out where and when we can vote early in-person and show up the minute they open their doors. We’ve got to set aside time to vote on Election Day so that we don’t get too busy and we’ve got to reach out to others, starting in our own backyard. As I like to say, we got to tend our own gardens. That means reaching out to all those folks who we might not be able to count on voting. You know who they are, the folks who might not be as tuned in as we are. Make sure they request their ballots too, make sure they know where their polling location is. Take them with you to vote if you need to and make sure you text BELIEVE to 30330 to get involved today.\nMichelle Obama: (24:25)\nWork like this may not feel as impactful as attending a protest, but trust me, it is absolutely the most important thing that we can do right now to save our democracy. It’s simply what needs to be done and that’s what we’ve been doing for months, just getting the job done, no matter the stress, no matter if something feels out of our control. Because that’s who we are as Americans. That is what we do.\nMichelle Obama: (24:59)\nRight now, we’ve got a chance to start getting things back under control, to restore some stability and integrity and soul in this country. It is within our grasp. That’s what keeps me going, thinking about a time not all that far off, with a new president in the Oval Office, a trustworthy, honest, stable leader with a clear plan for controlling this virus and getting our economy back on track. With meaningful support for families and schools, with competence and maturity instead of chaos and confusion. It is possible. It really is, but only if we vote for Joe Biden in this election. We have all been working so hard to keep ourselves and our families afloat and we deserve a president who will do the same.\nMichelle Obama: (26:02)\nThank you for listening. God bless.",

         "Speaker 1: (05:25)\nFrom NBC news, the Joe Biden town hall live from the Perez Art Museum in Miami here’s Lester Holt.\nLester Holt: (05:35)\nGood evening, everyone. Welcome to tonight’s town hall, where we are surrounded by dozens of undecided voters and where Democratic candidate Joe Biden will answer our questions and make his case tonight. Just under an hour ago, we saw the President return to the white house by helicopter after spending three days at nearby Walter Reed Military Hospital, where was treated for his coronavirus infection. Upon his return, the President removed his mask and pose for cameras of the white house balcony. We were in the midst of an extraordinary time with the election now just four weeks away and millions of Americans already voting. In just the past six days we’ve seen a contentious first Presidential debate followed by the stunning news that the President himself had fallen ill after testing positive for the virus. Tonight, we’ll talk to his opponent, Joe Biden about all this and much more in our exclusive town hall. We’ve got a lot to get to tonight so let’s start with a quick update from chief white house correspondent at Hallie Jackson. Hallie.\nHallie Jackson: (06:40)\nLester, good evening. The President’s returned to the white house was a moment that sent a message, but it’s not clear it’s the message the President had hoped to send. The news that he is now out of the hospital overshadowed by him landing on the South lawn of the white house, walking up to the blue room balcony and removing his mask, you can see it here, he then puts it in his pocket. It doesn’t look like anybody was around the President in his immediate vicinity, but already you’re hearing concerns about the signal this sends to Americans from the President of the United States, who is actively infected with the coronavirus after seven months in a pandemic, in which we were all told that wearing masks is a critical part of lowering risk. All of this Lester, following the President’s walk out of Walter Reed.\nHallie Jackson: (07:20)\nHe stepped out of that main entrance after about a 72 hour, stay at the medical center, came down the stairs and flashed a thumbs up. Through his hospitalization his white house has been focused on photo opportunities like these, trying to show Americans that the President is still in control, the President is still in charge. His physician, Dr. Sean Connolly says he is confident in the President’s progress, but acknowledges President Trump is not entirely out of the woods yet. And while Dr. Connolly says the President has no more fever, no more cough, we don’t have an answer on, for example, what the President’s lung scans show. There are some concerns that the President may have had pneumonia. [inaudible 00:07:58] President’s last negative test was either, that’s actually a really important point for figuring out who else may have been exposed and at risk. Lester.\nLester Holt: (08:05)\nAll right, Hallie Jackson, thank you. And we are joined by Vice President Biden, thank you for being here.\nJoe Biden: (08:10)\nThanks for having me Lester, I appreciate it.\nLester Holt: (08:13)\nWe had a lot to talk about it and I really want these folks to drive the conversation as much as we can, but I’ve got to ask you about some of the things that Hallie just mentioned there. The President got discharged from the hospital today, flown aboard Marine One back to the white house. At one point, it climbs the stairs and he takes his mask off with other people who appear to be somewhat nearby. Did you see it? Did you hear about it? What’s your reaction, sir?\nJoe Biden: (08:37)\nI would hope that the President having gone through what he went through and I’m glad he seems to be coming along pretty well, would communicate the right lesson to the American people, masks matter. These masks, they matter. It matters and saves lives, it prevents the spread of the disease, social distancing. The only thing I heard was one of the Tweets saying don’t be so concerned about all this, essentially. There’s a lot to be concerned about, 210,000 people have died. You have about 1,000 people a day getting the coronavirus, I mean, it’s a great concern. I hope no one walks away with a message thinking that it is not a problem, it’s a serious problem. It’s an international pandemic and we have 4% of the population and 20% of the deaths.\nLester Holt: (09:30)\nI know you offered your good wishes to the President and the first lady did you pick up the phone? Did you call the President?\nJoe Biden: (09:37)\nNo, I didn’t. I inquired whether I should do that. And the decision was that would probably be intrusive, but I’m truly happy if things are really moving along, like he said, and particularly the first lady as well, I’m very happy for that.\nLester Holt: (09:56)\nYou have built your campaign around the coronavirus has been your number one issue. So when you hear that this president was infected with COVID-19, were you surprised?\nJoe Biden: (10:08)\nQuite frankly, I wasn’t surprised. Look, for the last three months, three times a week I’m on the telephone and on Zoom with some of the leading immunologist in the nation and they go through everything that’s happening. And so, the idea that COVID does not spread in proximity when you don’t have a mask on, when you’re not socially distancing, when there’s large groups of people when you’re inside particularly, but even when you’re outside, that’s not surprising. And again, we keep forgetting, or we’re not talking about it. 210,000 people have died already and the expectation is if nothing changes, we’re going to have another 200,000 dead by the end of the year. That’s 400,000 dead, God forbid if that happens, that’s more of them were killed in one year in America than four years in World War II.\nLester Holt: (11:11)\nI want to ask you about the information we’ve been given on the President’s medical condition from his doctors at Walter Reed. Also, some of the information about his condition from the white house. Do you think that the doctors have been forthcoming, that they’ve been transparent? Do you trust the assessments we’ve been hearing?\nJoe Biden: (11:26)\nI’m not going to second guess his doctors, he has some of the best healthcare in the world and I’m happy it was available to him. It should be available the President of United States in America, but the vast majority of Americans, the vast majority of people here in this audience, your camera man, if God forbid, something happened to them, they don’t have that access to that care, so it’s comparing apples and oranges a little bit.\nLester Holt: (11:51)\nYou were on the debate stage with the President for 90 minutes, you were socially distant, but hearing that he was infected, did you have a moment of pause, of worry and concern for your own safety?\nJoe Biden: (12:01)\nNo, because look, I’ve been fastidious about the social distancing. I’ve been fastidious about wearing a mask when I’m not socially distanced and even then remaining socially distanced. And so, we never got closer than you and I are right now, as well as when Melania came up on the stage, she smiled and waved, I waved to her, but it was the same distance. It was a little disconcerting to look out and see that his whole section, no one had masks on when my wife was sitting further down had a mask on, the people with us had masks on. I didn’t quite get that.\nLester Holt: (12:38)\nYou were able to see that from where you were?\nJoe Biden: (12:39)\nYes. When they came in, yes, because I was standing backstage and you could see people coming in and a lot of people didn’t have masks on.\nLester Holt: (12:48)\nIf you become President, can you pledge transparency about your health if God forbid something like this happened, or some other health issue that you would be forthcoming to the American people?\nJoe Biden: (12:58)\nYes, but look, I can understand there could be certain circumstances relating to national security where every detail would not be made available in the middle of a particular crisis. But the overall question of whether or not I’d be transparent about whether or not I had a serious problem or what treatment I got. Yes, but sometimes for a President that would come after the fact. So I’m not being critical of the fact that every single detail was not released. There is the HIPAA rules, they even apply to the President but they have consequences for a President beyond the rules relating to what is able to be done and not done without a patient’s permission, they have national security implications as well.\nLester Holt: (13:39)\nSo that is to say some things you think would be okay to hold back.\nJoe Biden: (13:44)\nWell, only on the margins and only for the moment. In other words, other President’s have been through it. I was there when Ronald Reagan was shot, he was transparent, but they didn’t go into every single detail precisely. And that’s one of my buddies going up, but all kidding aside, so I think on balance, you have to tell the whole truth, what had happened, what was happening and what’s going on. But as moment to moment, I’m not sure that that is an absolute requirement, but you cannot mislead about certain things and I’m not saying they have. If in fact, the President had in fact contracted the virus and knew it before he went on into public encounters and was not wearing a mask that’s a different thing.\nLester Holt: (14:40)\nYeah. One more question on this before we move on and hear from some of the voters. A recent poll said that 65% of Americans think the President bears some responsibility for contracting this virus, do you agree?\nJoe Biden: (14:53)\nLook, anybody who contracts the virus by essentially saying masks don’t matter, social distancing doesn’t matter, I think is responsible for what happens to them. If these people took off their masks and they all have them on, I notice, and just all of a sudden gotten a gaggle and started talking to one another well, they’re taking responsibility that in fact they should be held responsible for. Because every major scientists and doctor and immunologist has said, “That’s a very dangerous thing to do.” The particles and droplets can stay in the air for a long time, longer than they thought, it can go beyond 10 feet. There’s all kinds of things they’ve learned and know and look, I view wearing this mask not so much protecting me, but as a patriotic responsibility. All the tough guys say, “Oh, I’m not wearing a mask, I’m not afraid.” Well, be afraid for your husband, your wife, your son, your daughter, your neighbor, your coworker, that’s who you’re protecting having this mask on and it should be viewed as a patriotic duty, to protect those around you.\nLester Holt: (16:04)\nYou ready to hear from some voters now?\nJoe Biden: (16:06)\nSure.\nLester Holt: (16:06)\nAll right. Let’s bring out first of all, Vanessa Tamariz. Vanessa, nice to see you.\nJoe Biden: (16:11)\nHi Vanessa.\nLester Holt: (16:12)\nThank you for being with us. What’s your question for the Vice President?\nVanessa Tamariz: (16:15)\nHi, Vice President Biden. I’m sorry, I’m a little nervous here.\nJoe Biden: (16:18)\nI’m having trouble hearing her.\nVanessa Tamariz: (16:19)\nThank you, sir. Vice President Biden, I work in Miami as a pediatric nurse and since the beginning of this pandemic, the government has been dysfunctional and disorganized in their response.\nJoe Biden: (16:36)\nI can’t hear her Lester.\nLester Holt: (16:36)\nYou can’t hear her?\nVanessa Tamariz: (16:36)\n[inaudible 00:16:36] leads the state of Florida in the number of COVID cases and deaths and Florida just ranked number two in the COVID cases of children. Another larger wave is expected this fall, sir. Can you tell us what the Biden-Harris federal response plan is that would unite our country in fighting this pandemic and also any other future pandemics that may arise?\nLester Holt: (17:03)\nWhere you able to hear okay?\nVanessa Tamariz: (17:03)\nThank you sir.\nVanessa Tamariz: (17:03)\n… also any other future pandemics that may arise?\nLester Holt: (17:03)\nAre we able to hear okay?\nVanessa Tamariz: (17:03)\nThank you, sir.\nJoe Biden: (17:04)\nI could hear part of it. I’m sorry. The television is in front of you and I didn’t catch the [crosstalk 00:17:09]\nLester Holt: (17:08)\nYeah, and we’ve got the traffic. The meat of her question is, another larger wave expected this Fall, can you tell us what the Biden-Harris federal response plan that would unite our country in fighting this pandemic and any other future pandemics that will arise?\nJoe Biden: (17:22)\nWell, first of all, as Present of the United States, I would make a federal mandate on federal property, federal buildings, you must wear a mask, period, and you must be socially distanced. Number one. Number two, I would make sure we move very rapidly to get testing available to everyone, that’s quickly available so people can, in fact, be in a position where they can open their businesses, they can test their employees, test people coming in. I would make sure that we’re in a situation … I don’t know whether you have children, if you have children and they’re not in school. Well, you have to make a tough decision, many people. Excuse my back, I apologize. But do you, in fact, stay home and not be able to pay your rent because you have to take care of your child? What do you do? Those very difficult decisions.\nJoe Biden: (18:08)\nAnd so the way we know how to open schools safety, I laid out a plan all the way back in the beginning of the Summer, we should provide them for the ventilation they need, all the needs that they have for a mask and social distancing and testing. For example, the President had committed and FEMA, the emergency management organization, said, “We’re going to give masks to teachers as well as to the students.” And then the administration said, “Well, no. Guess what? That’s not a national emergency.” Well, what in God’s name is a national emergency if that’s not a national emergency? So it costs money to deal with all of these things, and we should, in fact, be using the money passed by the Congress to see [inaudible 00:18:53] people go and open their businesses safely, be able to keep their employees on the payroll, making sure they can have the sanitation capacity and ability to sanitize their stores as well as their schools. All of those things we will do, and more, I know I’m going on too long, but there’s a lot here that relates to what’s totally within our wheelhouse.\nLester Holt: (19:14)\nWell, can I follow up with that a little bit?\nJoe Biden: (19:15)\nSure.\nLester Holt: (19:16)\nI heard you mention this idea of a national mandate.\nJoe Biden: (19:19)\nYes.\nLester Holt: (19:19)\nYou’ve mentioned that before for masks, but what power does a President have to make that happen?\nJoe Biden: (19:24)\nHe doesn’t, beyond the federal property. I would go out and I would talk. I would call all the Governors to the White House. Some probably wouldn’t come. And I’d call the governors and I’d say to the mayors as well as the county executives, “Take responsibility. Take responsibility and lay out the guidelines.” Look, folks, one of the problems is this President said, “I take no responsibility. Literally, it’s not my responsibility.” Well, if it’s not his responsibility … He talked about this being like a time of war. We are under attack, as I said earlier, 200,000, plus have died, 50,000 a day are getting the virus, 1000 a day thereabouts are dying. This is a national emergency. And so the President should take responsibility and the federal government has an obligation to lay out basic guidelines. And the science matters. Listen to the scientists.\nLester Holt: (20:20)\nAll right. Let’s get another question. Vanessa, thank you for your question. Our next one comes from Jonathan Pines. He’s the undecided voter from Hollywood, Florida, a registered Republican. I think he says he’s leaning toward you. What’s your question?\nJoe Biden: (20:32)\nI can’t see Jonathan, but I’ll back up here. Maybe I can see it from there.\nLester Holt: (20:34)\nHe’s over right here.\nJoe Biden: (20:35)\nThe camera blocks [crosstalk 00:20:35].\nJonathan: (20:35)\nThanks. Can you hear me?\nJoe Biden: (20:36)\nYou’re a good looking guy, that’s why they want to get the camera shot of you.\nJonathan: (20:39)\nOh thank you. I agree. In light of recent events, it’s obvious that the pandemic can reach anyone. While the health and lives of the American people should come first, there’s been a combination of fear, shutdowns, isolationism, conflicting data, and school closings. And these have long lasting effects which have taken both a psychological and financial toll on nearly all of us. How do you plan to balance these factors with the expectation that COVID will be with us for the foreseeable future?\nJoe Biden: (21:05)\nWell, first of all, again, I don’t want to repeat myself too much. Science matters. There’s overwhelming scientific consensus. The President’s own head of CDC, Dr. Redfield, held up a mask and said, “If you put this mask on between now and January, you’ll save 100.” He said, “It’s more important than a virus, excuse me, than a vaccine. You can save more lives.” They’ve laid out, the University of Washington, one of the great universities that lays out all these projections, they said there could be 200,000 people dead between now and January. And they said, “If you wear a mask, we can save 100,000 lives.” Now, what is this macho thing I’m not going to wear a mask? What’s the deal here? Big deal. Does it hurt you? Be patriotic, for God’s sake. Take care of yourself but take care of your neighbors.\nJoe Biden: (21:59)\nAnd so the one thing we have to do is we have to unite the country. One of the reasons when I said I was running, I had three objectives. One, to restore the soul of this country so we start acting with a decency that reflects who we are. Secondly, rebuild the middle class. And thirdly, unite the country. Remember I was roundly criticized at my primaries. “You can’t unite the country.” We must. It’s the only way we can move forward, and the country is ready to be united I believe. They’re ready to be United. And we have to just change the way we talk to one another. Politics has become so mean and so ugly that we’ve got to get rid of that. We’ve got to just start talking to each other like we respect each other, which we have to. Thank you, Jon.\nLester Holt: (22:44)\nOur next question comes from Brian Smith. He’s a recently unemployed flight attendant who started an online support group for laid off airline workers.\nBrian Smith: (22:53)\nThat’s correct. Hello. I want to thank you, sir, for having me here and taking my question. I am one of over 8,000 flight attendants that American Airlines had to furlough this past weekend. And my question to you is, if you’re elected President, what will you do to restore the travel and tourism industry to get it back on its feet and get it back up to pre-COVID levels so that we’re just not throwing more money at it?\nJoe Biden: (23:22)\nWell, look, my best friend … I’m a lucky man. I married into a family with five daughters. That means that one of them always loves you. Not the same one. Even when your wife’s mad, there’s always one with you. One of my sister-in-law is an attendant and she’s been for a long, long time facing the same kind of thing you’re facing. We could have, in fact, already solved that problem. The Congress passed the legislation to provide the money to keep the airlines up and running and to provide for the kinds of ways in which you can sanitize that aircraft, make sure everyone has on a mask. For example, recently, the Department of Transportation turned down a request from bus drivers and mass transit people and you guys, saying, “Everybody you get in the plane has to have a mask on. If they don’t have a mask on, then they can’t get in the plane.”\nJoe Biden: (24:14)\nWhat are we doing? Do you feel comfortable being an attendant and people getting on a crowded plane or not a crowded plane with no mask? You don’t. It’s just to protect you, protect one another. That’s within our power to do it. And look, one of the things we have to do is we have to provide funding for people who have been caught in the lurch. Look, the President, and he should, got great medical care, but that’s why I’m arguing from the very beginning of this, every one who contracts COVID should have their bills paid, paid for. People can’t afford this. And we’re in court right now, trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Already 10 million people have lost their employer based insurance, their COVID based insurance, 10 million. And they’re in court trying to do away with another 20 million who already get it through Obamacare. And, in addition to that, 100 million people with preexisting conditions.\nJoe Biden: (25:13)\nYou know people who have had COVID. It would be wonderful if you didn’t, but if you do, you know you end up with heart problems and lung scarring. They become pre-existing conditions. So there’s a lot of things we can do. But guess what, folks? If we can spend money giving tax breaks for a racehorse, we can get tax breaks for the kinds of things we’re out there doing, three martini lunch. God, all mighty, why can’t we, in fact, give a tax break for people, free access to healthcare if you’re in the middle of a COVID crisis?\nLester Holt: (25:44)\nAll right, thank you. We’re going to take a short break. We’ll be back with more questions from our voters to Vice President Joe Biden after this break. (music).\nSpeaker 2: (25:51)\nFirefighters have had more favorable conditions, allowing them to push the flames away from homes, but the wind can change all of this on a dime.\nSpeaker 3: (26:34)\nWe can continue to expect protests as people continue to call for more answers to what happened and continue to call for that accountability.\nSpeaker 4: (26:42)\nIt’s starting to feel like a typical general election, both candidates actually out on the campaign trail making their pitch to voters.\nSpeaker 5: (26:50)\nThe moment to truly understand who we are and who we say we are is right here at our feet.\nChris Hayes: (26:54)\nYou got to get a four year degree, but a four year degree is super expensive. We have created a system where the ticket to the middle-class is a thing that middle-class families have to stress about and borrow for and patched together.\nSpeaker 6: (27:12)\nWhy Is This Happening with Chris Hayes.

How did they really feel about returning to school?\nSpeaker 13: (27:43)\nWhat I miss is my teachers.\nSavannah Guthrie: (27:46)\nThey are resilient.\nLester Holt: (27:51)\nToday’s headlines can be hard to understand, and a lot of kids have questions. So we started a newscast for them. We hope your family will watch Nightly News Kids Edition.\nNicolle Wallace: (28:01)\nThe person leveling the accusations isn’t me. It’s John Bolton. I have heard from sources and you guys have reported that Dr. Fauci through Secretary Azar had been banging the pots and pans very early in the year. I worked on campaigns. If that was a campaign event, it was a crummy one.\nSpeaker 14: (28:24)\nDeadline White house is now two hours. Weekdays from 4:00 to 6:00 on MSNBC.\nLester Holt: (28:31)\nProtests broke out. The coronavirus pandemic.\nSpeaker 15: (28:33)\nThe story.\nLester Holt: (28:34)\nEmergency approval to treat COVID-19 with plasma. Many questions remain about how well it works.\nSpeaker 15: (28:40)\nFrom every angle.\nSpeaker 16: (28:41)\nHow much of the increased tension was due to the militias that came here?\nSpeaker 15: (28:44)\nOn the ground.\nSpeaker 17: (28:46)\nDeadly Western wildfires in California. Entire communities were also wiped off the map.\nSpeaker 15: (28:52)\nAnd in depth.\nSpeaker 18: (28:53)\nOne of the big concerns is indoor air quality. What are you doing to address that?\nSpeaker 15: (28:57)\nNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.\nLester Holt: (29:04)\nBack at our Town Hall Meeting in Miami with Democratic Presidential Candidate, Joe Biden and our questions from voters. Our next question comes from Ingrid Gilliam-Alexander, who is undecided but leaning toward Biden. What’s your question?\nIngrid Gilliam-Alexander: (29:20)\nGood evening, Mr. Biden.\nJoe Biden: (29:22)\nI can hear you.\nIngrid Gilliam-Alexander: (29:24)\nWatching the debate, I noticed that President Trump was bullying you and I’m worried that it knocked you off your game. How do I know that you’re able to forcefully lead this country moving forward when being faced with unforeseen challenges and other bullies?\nJoe Biden: (29:41)\nWell, I’m used to bullies. I used to stutter when I was a kid. I learned how to fight. I got a nickname. They called me Shoe Leather. I was little, but they could beat me up and I hurt them in the process. Look, I was surprised to learn that Chris Wallace said there were 158 interruptions in that debate we had. And it was just very difficult to … I didn’t want to further demean the process of the debate by getting in a shouting match with him. On the one hand, I tried very hard, if you noticed, to look in the camera and ask the questions directly. But they kept getting bang. I hope this next meeting we’re going to have, it’s called a debate, but a town meeting we’re going to have supposedly coming up, that I hope we at least have an opportunity to hear the question and answer the question directly before there’s an interruption. But as I said to the President, “Not here, not tonight, not me. I’m not putting up with it.”\nLester Holt: (30:43)\nLet me ask you this, Vice President Biden. It was an ugly debate and it hits some lows. You called him a clown, a fool. You told him to shut up. I think most people believe that the President was interrupting you, but it seemed to go against some of the language you’ve said about not being divisive. Do you regret any part, on your part?\nJoe Biden: (31:05)\nIt did, and I was trying to figure out how I could possibly have him respect the debate, respect the evening, respect the moderator, and get us an opportunity to speak. The one thing that became absolutely clear, he didn’t want to answer any questions. He did not want to talk about substance. If you noticed, not one single time that I can recall that he offered a substantive answer or criticism related to a policy matter. It was all invective. It was all personal. It was all things that have nothing to do with whether they’re going to change these people’s lives for the better. And I did get very frustrated. I did get frustrated, and I should have said, “This is a clownish undertaking,” instead of calling him a clown. But the fact is it was, I’ll be very honest with you, I think it was embarrassing for the nation to see the Present of the United States hectoring like he did and everything was about a personal attack.\nLester Holt: (32:05)\nBut to the point of the question, though, you’re going to be meeting with world leaders who are going to get under your skin.\nJoe Biden: (32:12)\nI’ve dealt with more world leaders than he has and went face to face over eight years. And they’ve got under my skin and we’ve had very quiet conversations. I told President Putin exactly what I think of him. He knows it. We looked eye to eye, and we know what’s going on. I’ve made the same assessment to Milosevic. I’ve had the same kinds of conversations across the board. You can look back on all those international meetings I have. You can’t think of a time when I’ve not handled it properly.\nLester Holt: (32:39)\nAll right.\nJoe Biden: (32:39)\nBut I don’t have somebody screaming at me at the next podium when I’m meeting with a world leader.\nLester Holt: (32:45)\nAll right, let’s get our next question from Michelle Cruz, is from Coral Gables. Used to be a registered Republican, but voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Her husband is in the crowd, I believe. What’s your question?\nMichelle Cruz Marrero: (32:57)\nGood evening, Mr. Vice President. As a mother of a police officer and the wife of a retired police officer who served 28 years, the term “defending the police” is up concern and troubling. I understand that police departments do need reform. We need to serve and protect safely and properly. With that being said, I would like to know what you and your administration’s policies in reforming the police, how those will come about, how they will be best handled to ensure police officers’ safety and the public and citizens’ safety as well?\nJoe Biden: (33:38)\nI grew up in a neighborhood where the guys I grew up with in my working class neighborhood either became cops, firefighters, or priests. I wasn’t qualified to be any one of them. I have had overwhelming support from police my whole career up until this year as your husband will tell. The vast, vast, vast majority of police are honorable, decent men and women who risk their lives every single day when they put on that …\nJoe Biden: (34:03)\n… women who risk their lives every single day when they put on that badge and walk out that door. They have a right to come home safely. But there’s bad apples in every profession. There are lousy commentators. There are lousy presidents. There’s lousy senators, docs. And they should be in fact … I can think of, I don’t know, any police department around that isn’t happy to get rid of a lousy cop, because it just reflects on them. And by the way, the same with the protestors. It’s a right to protest peacefully. But once you pick up a bat and start smashing windows, once in fact you light something on fire, once you engage in violence, you should be arrested and held accountable. And I’ve never had a position different than that from the very beginning.\nJoe Biden: (34:40)\nSo what I’m going to do, I’m going to do what I’ve done in the past. I’m going to bring all these interests together, peaceful protesters, police chiefs, police officers, and police unions, as well as the civil rights groups in the White House and sit down and decide what are the things that need to be done to improve and help police officers. I’m the only one who’s talked about increasing police budgets. When your husband goes on a call that in fact is a 911 call, it’s better if he or she has with them a psychologist or psychiatrist with them. Someone who knows how to deal with someone who is not all there. And so there’s a lot of things we should be doing.\nJoe Biden: (35:19)\nIn addition to that, I also am proposing that we spend significant more money on community policing. The reason it worked … My son used to be an attorney general in the state of Delaware. The idea is you get the police, you get the law enforcement together with the community, so they know one another. Because that kid walking across the street with a hoodie on may be the next poet laureate. It doesn’t mean that child is going to be in trouble. And so we got to make sure there’s more communication. That’s what I’m going to do as president, bring together a national commission sitting in the White House with me, with me and working this out.\nLester Holt: (35:57)\nAll right. Our next question is from Nicole Maddox. She is an undecided voter. Nicole, what’s your question?\nNicole Maddox: (36:04)\nHello, Vice President Biden. So as an African-American female, I have never lived through what I’m living through right now. And at times, I don’t feel safe in this country. And so my question to you is what would you do to stop extremists and white supremacist groups.\nJoe Biden: (36:21)\nStop what? I’m sorry.\nNicole Maddox: (36:22)\nWhite supremacist groups. And what would be your approach to police reform to ensure that people who look like me and my family feel safe in this country?\nJoe Biden: (36:33)\nNumber one, the president’s own FBI director has said the greatest domestic threat to terrorism are white supremacists. White supremacists. And when you have a president saying to one particular group of white supremacists that in fact stand down but stand by, that is like a clarying call to get ready. Get ready. It’s totally, totally inappropriate. These guys are driving me crazy. I love them, but I can’t see them when they walk by. But all kidding aside, here’s the deal, we got to make sure that when we interview police for the job, that there’s a more thorough interview process. There’s more background checking being done and attitudes. It matters.\nJoe Biden: (37:20)\nCops are kind of like school teachers. Everything lands on their desk, no matter what it is, whether it’s a child that’s in trouble on the street or whether it’s somebody who has a mental problem or someone who’s robbing a bank. And you can’t expect them to have all this broad knowledge to how to handle everything. They need more help. They need more money as a matter of fact.\nJoe Biden: (37:43)\nBut in the meantime, in the meantime, what we have to do is make sure there is quote … it sounds … all the tough guys are going to say it’s a silly word, sensitivity training. Understanding other cultures, know what people are like, what they’re thinking about, how they act, what is consistent with the culture that they’re from. It’s important we know that. We’re a nation of immigrants. We’re a nation that’s so diverse. And it’s very difficult to make sure police officers are trained enough to be able to know what to expect in a community.\nJoe Biden: (38:16)\nBut the biggest thing we have to do is make sure that they learn to deal with diminishing the kind of force that they use. What is the minimum force required in order to be able to deal with whatever the situation is? It’s about diminishing the prospect of use of excessive force. It’s about eliminating some things totally, like choke holds. It’s about making sure that no knock warrants are changed, so people know what’s going on. There’s a whole range of things we can do. The commission President Obama and I set up early on was in the process of doing that until this president got elected. What happened was, if you notice, there has been sort of a dog whistle out there that is that everything’s about division and hate.\nJoe Biden: (39:03)\nThe reason I decided to run for office … I hadn’t planned on running again. I gave you my word. After my son passed, I wasn’t going to run again. But when I saw those people coming out of the woods, literally the fields, carrying torches in Charlottesville, screeching that … If you close your eyes, remember what you saw, their veins bulgy, preaching anti-Semitic hate, the same exact language Jews in Germany in the thirties accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. And when a young woman was innocently killed, what was the question asked to the president? What do you think? He said they’re very fine people on both sides. No president has ever said anything remotely like that.\nLester Holt: (39:43)\nMr. Vice-\nJoe Biden: (39:43)\nSo there’s this constant dog whistle, and it bothers me a lot.\nLester Holt: (39:47)\nMr. Vice President, though, the critics and Donald Trump himself will say that you had almost 50 years working in government and legislation and as a vice president, and you weren’t able to accomplish those things then.\nJoe Biden: (40:00)\nYes, and I wasn’t president.\nLester Holt: (40:01)\nHe points out in a criminal justice reform bill. You and Barack Obama served at a time when you had both houses of Congress and still couldn’t get some of these things done.\nJoe Biden: (40:11)\nYeah, we did. We let 18,000 people got clemency. He got two or three where he’s talking about. The violent crime rate was down 15% in our administration. 15% down. You didn’t see these white supremacists rising up. Look, one thing I learned a long time, I got involved because of the civil rights movement when I was a kid. My state is the eighth largest black population. No great shakes, I’m not making myself out to be a great civil rights leader. But that’s how I got involved with politics. And one of the interesting things was that I came back to Wilmington after my city was burned. 20% of it was burned to the ground when Dr. King was assassinated. And I had a job with a very prestigious law firm. But we were only sitting in America since the civil war occupied by the national guard withdrawn bayonets for 10 months.\nJoe Biden: (41:04)\nAnd after I got admitted to the bar, I decided I couldn’t do this. I quit and became a public defendant. And I remember going down to … if you ride the Northeast Carter, you go from Washington to New York. You go by the Wilmington station. I used to have to interview my clients down there before their arraignment. And what would happen is that I found that I had not thought that black and whites would never get together again in Delaware.\nJoe Biden: (41:27)\nAnd here I was almost 40 years later to the month in January of 2009, waiting for a train to come from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, carrying a black man about to pick me up to take me 147 miles to Washington, DC to be sworn in as president vice-president. Honest to God’s truth, I called my three kids up. One’s a social worker. One was run running the World Food Program USA, the largest in the world. And my other son was the attorney general. And I was standing on a platform. I looked over the east side, which had just been leveled and what they call the third street bridge was burned. And I said, “Look, guys,” I said, “don’t tell me things can’t change. Look what’s happened. When I stood here 40 years ago to the month, that was burned to the ground. Now look at it. Look at it.”\nJoe Biden: (42:18)\nI talked about there’s hope, but I made a big mistake. I didn’t realize that you can’t defeat hate. Hate only hides. It hides under the rocks. And when you give it oxygen, when you breathe into it, you bring out the worst of people and you legitimize them. That’s what’s happened. We’ve legitimized these people who engaged in hate based on race and color and religion. And it’s wrong. And the way we have to deal with it is we have to make sure that we equip every agency, federal, state, and local agency with the tools that are going to be bringing people together.\nLester Holt: (42:55)\nVice President Biden, on that note, we’re going to have to take a short break. We’ve got more questions from our voters. And we’ll do that from Miami in just a moment.\nSpeaker 19: (43:35)\nFirefighters have had more favorable conditions, allowing them to push the flames away from homes. But the wind can change all of this on a dime.\nSpeaker 3: (43:42)\nWe can continue to expect protests as people continue to call for more answers to what happened and continue to call for that accountability.\nSpeaker 4: (43:50)\nStarting to feel like a typical general election. Both candidates actually out on the campaign trail, making a pitch to voters.\nSpeaker 3: (43:58)\nThe moment to truly understands who we are and who we say we are is right here at our feet.\nChris Hayes: (44:05)\nYou got to get a four-year degree, but a four year degree is super expensive.

Subscribe now.\nSpeaker 3: (46:36)\nWelcome back. Welcome back, Miami and the town hall meeting with former vice president, Joe Biden, taking questions about undecided voters. Our next question comes from Danny Lavandera. Danny, what’s your question?\nDanny Lavendera: (46:47)\nGood evening, Mr. Vice President. Teachers need to be in the classroom, but I believe that this needs to be done in a safe environment for all. What are your plans to ensure that schools are safe for teachers as well as students in the middle of this pandemic?\nJoe Biden: (47:02)\nNumber one, depending on the circumstance in terms of the transmission rate in your community that would have a lot to do whether the school should open at all, whether the chance should be taken. That’s what all of senior doctors and immunologists say. So if you have a high rate of the spread of the disease in your community, it’s better not to open that school. But if you’re at a place where it’s less than under one, then in fact it’s possible to open. But you have to open safely.\nJoe Biden: (47:31)\nAnd it requires four things. It requires making sure that you as a teacher, my wife is a teacher, has the PPE to be able to open safely, so your health is in good shape, because children can communicate the disease as well as contract it. Number one. Number two, you have to be in a position where the children are able to be in smaller modules. That requires more teachers or spreading out students in a way that you don’t have large groups … If you have a class of 25, you ended up having two classes of 12, for example. So you have smaller groups.\nJoe Biden: (48:05)\nNumber three, that the sanitation capacity in this school is upgraded, so you’re able to keep everything from the laboratories to the hallways, to the surfaces clean, and they’re able to be done. Fourthly to make sure that you’re in a situation where there is a circumstance that you know that there is not overcrowding in the school so that you have enough teachers, as I said, to make sure that you can spread them out, spread out the children.\nJoe Biden: (48:33)\nWhen that is done, then you can more safely open up. And I’d be happy to send you a copy of the actual plan. I wrote back in July based on the recommendations of the leading scientists in the country as to how to safely open. Safely open, because people are worried about the child going home with the disease, spreading it to their grandpop or grandmom or the older member of the family and them getting very sick.\nJoe Biden: (49:02)\nAnd right now we haven’t even done … In the vaccines, there’s not even been any experimentation done on testing children for a vaccine yet. That’s a different issue. But in the meantime, you can open safely, limit class size, make sure the hallways are open in ways that they’re not crowded, everybody wearing a mask, social distancing, ventilation taken care of in the schools so that you’re able to make sure that it is not lingering in the air. There are the kinds of things … And it’s estimated by the superintendents nationwide to open every school in America safely it’d be about $200 billion.\nLester Holt: (49:38)\nAll right, Danny, thank you for your question. Our next one comes from Cassidy Brown in Orlando. Voted for the first time in 2016. Nice to have a here.\nMichelle Cruz Marrero: (49:44)\nThank you.\nJoe Biden: (49:44)\nHey, Cassidy.\nMichelle Cruz Marrero: (49:46)\nHello, Mr. Biden. My youngest sister is in high school right now. And I knew whenever I was graduating high school and entering college that I wanted to obtain my degree and start a career before starting a family. Having access to birth control and safe reproductive health care was imperative in making that true for me. So considering the new Supreme court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, what are your particular plans to protect women’s reproductive rights in the US?\nJoe Biden: (50:19)\nNumber one, we don’t know exactly what she will do. Although, the expectation is that she may very well overrule Row. But the only responsible response to that would be to pass legislation making Row the law of the land. That’s what I would do.\nLester Holt: (50:41)\nAll right. We will take a short break. And we’ve got more questions for you, Mr. Vice President, when we continue our town hall meeting.\nSpeaker 19: (51:22)\nFirefighters have had more favorable conditions allowing them to push the flames away from homes, but the wind can change all of this on a dime.\nIsmael Illiano: (51:30)\nWe can continue to expect protests as people continue to call for more answers to what happened and continue to call for that accountability.\nNicolle Wallace: (51:37)\nIt’s starting to feel like a typical general election. Both candidates actually out on the campaign trail making their pitch to voters.\nSpeaker 5: (51:46)\nThe moment to truly understand who we are and who we say we are is right here at our feet.\nChris Hayes: (51:53)\nYou’ve got to get a four year degree, but a four year degree is super expensive.

What are you doing to address that?\nSpeaker 14: (53:53)\nNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.\nLester Holt: (54:04)\nAnd we are back at our town hall in Miami with Joe Biden, and we’ve got more questions from our voters. Let’s go to Ismael Illiano who voted for Hillary Clinton four years ago but has voted Republican in the past. What’s your question for Mr. Biden?\nIsmael Illiano: (54:16)\nHi, Mr. Vice President. You a lot about your unity and division, but it seems now more than ever there’s a divisiveness in the country that goes way beyond disagreeing with policy or whether you’ve made the right decision or not. It’s either, “You’re with me or you’re against me.” The role of president, in my opinion, should be to unify as much as possible, so what three actions will you take as president to get us back to being one country versus several little fiefdoms that are trying to outyell at each other about who’s wrong and right?\nJoe Biden: (54:49)\nWell, first of all there’s no reason why you should know, but I think I’m not Lester to confirm, but my entire career I’ve been able to bring Democrats and Republicans together. And people say, “Well, that was the old days, Joe. Things have changed.” Well, the only thing that’s changed is the way in which the politics that has been moved by some in the party have just gotten really ugly. I think what happens is, I think when people see if in fact I’m fortunate enough to win, I think the absence of the President’s willingness to go after and hold anyone accountable and disagrees with them like he did to his former attorney general down in Alabama when I campaigned against him, when he left the office, people are going to be less unwilling to compromise, number one. Number two, I think if you take a look at, what I learned a long time ago is that it’s always appropriate to question another man or woman’s judgment. It’s never appropriate to question their motive.\nJoe Biden: (55:52)\nI learned that lesson very early on. When I got elected the Senate I didn’t want to go because my wife and daughter were killed between the time I got elected and the time that I was sworn in. and a Senator named Mansfield was a majority leader, took me under his wing and insisted meeting with me every Tuesday at 2:00. I thought you got assignments from majority leaders. No Senator gets an assignment. Took him about five weeks, Lester, to realize just taking my pulse, to see how emotionally I was doing, because I agreed I’d come and stay for six months until they got organized.\nJoe Biden: (56:27)\nAnd what happened was I remember one day I walked into the Senate. If you look at C-SPAN, you know that big gold arch door you walk through to go down to the well? I walked in for my meeting and as I walked down to the floor of the Senate to find out when the last vote was going to be before I walked out the other side, because I went home every night to see my kids, there was a senator who was excoriating two people who became very close friends of mine, Bob Dole, and Teddy Kennedy.\nJoe Biden: (56:54)\nThey had introduced the precursor for the Americans With Disabilities Act, and I thought it was heartless. So anyway, I was more afraid of missing my meeting with the leaders so I went in and sat down in front of him. This was the last week in May, and I’d already figured out why I was seeing him. And he looked at me, said, “What’s the matter, Joe? And I went on and I said this particular Senator had no social redeeming value. How could he be so heartless? How could he not care about people? How could he say a curb cut was inappropriate to have? The buses had to have lifts, et cetera. He looked at me and said, “Joe, what would you say if I told you that same Senator and his wife two years ago were reading the paper in their hometown and there’s a picture of a young in braces from under his arms down to his ankles and two steel crutches? 14 years old saying, “All I want for Christmas is someone to love me and take me home.” So what would you say if I told you they adopted that young man?\nLester Holt: (57:51)\nBut I don’t think you got to the heart of Ismael’s question, which is something tangible, something you can do as a new president.\nJoe Biden: (57:59)\nI learned from him. He said, “It’s always appropriate to question another man’s judgment, but not their motive.” Once you question a senator’s motive you can never get anything done. I said, “You’re in the pocket of the cement industry. Let’s see if we can get a transportation bill passed.” It doesn’t work, and that’s why I put… Look, when President Trump had already been elected, I was Vice President. He had already been elected and I put together a group that came up with almost $9 billion to deal with cancer research. $ 9 billion. They said no would vote for it. We had a total of only, I think, 41 senators and something like 118 house members. 398 house members voted for it and 96 senators voted for it. My point is, you stop questioning motive. You go out and you debate the issues, because we’ve all gotten down to the point where everything is about attacking the integrity of the other person.\nJoe Biden: (58:55)\nAnd the last thing I would do is make sure that we in fact had… I reached out constantly, which I did as Vice President and as a chairman of a committees, Foreign Relations and the Judiciary Committee, reached out and brought the opposition in. Last point, for example, they said, “Joe, what are you going to do if you get to pick the next Supreme Court Justice?” It says advise and consent. You need the Senate to give advice and consent. Every president’s pulled us together has said, “This is who I’m thinking of,” and gone to Republican senators and Democratic senators and said, “What do you think?” You put together amendment, you put together coalitions. That’s how you deal in a democracy.\nLester Holt: (59:38)\nAll right, Peter Gonzalez has next question.\nPeter Gonzalez: (59:41)\nWelcome to Miami, Mr. Vice President. In fact, I was born in Hartford, Connecticut, I was raised in Hialeah, Florida, and I’ve been living in Coral Gables for the last 20 plus years. Cuban American and Venezuelan voters here in South Florida are being targeted with messages by the Trump campaign claiming that a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the radical left and socialism and even communism. What can you tell people in my family, my friends who are understandably concerned with that issue, that would make them feel comfortable voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?\nLester Holt: (01:00:14)\nLet me just point out, we have about three or four minutes left.\nJoe Biden: (01:00:16)\nI look like a socialist? Look, I’m the guy that ran against the socialist. Remember, I got in trouble through the whole campaign? 20 some candidates, Joe Biden was too centrist, too moderate, too straightforward? That was Joe Biden. I have taken on the very people that in fact we’re worried about. I’ve taken on the Castro’s of the world, I’ve taken on the Putin’s of the world. I’ve taken on all these dictators. I haven’t cozied up to them. I’m the guy that’s been straight forward with them. I’m the guy that let them know it stops here. It stops with me. It stops with me as president. I am no more socialist our communists than Donald Trump is… Well, I won’t say it. Anyway. So they need not worry. Just look at the record. There’s not one single syllable that I’ve ever said that could lead you to believe that I was a socialist or communist.\nLester Holt: (01:01:05)\nAll right. We’ve got time for I think for one more question. Mateo Gomez joins us now. First time voter. Came to the US from Columbia at age two. Welcome.\nJoe Biden: (01:01:12)\nSpent a lot of time in Columbia.\nMateo Gomez: (01:01:14)\nThank you, Lester, for the introduction. Vice President Biden, thank you so much for coming to Miami and speaking to us today. If you win in November there will be a 56 year age gap between you and myself. My generation, generation Z, is growing up with school shootings, police brutality, and protests, and the inability to earn a livable wage even when holding advanced degrees like myself. How can someone like yourself, an older white male, represent my generation over the next four years? And please Vice President Biden, can you guarantee me that the American dream still exists?\nLester Holt: (01:01:50)\nGot about 90 seconds.\nJoe Biden: (01:01:53)\nI’ll get the end. I guarantee you it still exists, number one. Look, with age comes wisdom, hopefully. I’ve been there. I’ve watched. I’m the guy that’s talked about the 9/11 generation getting so badly damaged. I’m the only one you’ve heard speak in the last five years about how your generation. My granddaughter just graduated with honors from Columbia Law School, in fact is having trouble. The fact that all my… I have two granddaughters that are in school in college, and two more children who are in high school. Your generation has been really put behind the eight ball. You get all these degrees, you end up with all this debt, and you’re in a position where you can’t get a job because no one’s hiring or they’re hiring and they’re hiring at very low wages. And so what we have to do is we have to make sure that you get the opportunity.\nJoe Biden: (01:02:41)\nThat’s why I’m going to eliminate a lot of your student debt if you come from a family less $1125,000 and you went to a public university. I’m going to make sure that everybody in this generation gets $10,000 knocked off of their student debt as we try to get out of this God awful pandemic. Going to make sure that the opportunities you have are consistent with… For example, if you’re a first home home buyer, you haven’t even had the opportunity to gain enough income to be able to have a down payment. The first term home buyers are going to get a $15,000 credit to be able to buy their first home, because that’s how people accumulate wealth. That’s how they get started. That’s how they move. We’re going to make sure we recognize you, advance you, and make sure that you…\nJoe Biden: (01:03:27)\nLook, my children, my grandchildren, you are the future. You are the future. I owe, as I said… For example, I made the comment that I view myself as a transitional president, as I want to transition to your generation. You’re the best educated, you’re the most open, you’re the least prejudice generation in American history. The future is yours, and I’m counting on you.\nLester Holt: (01:03:52)\nMr. Vice president, thank you. That is going to conclude tonight our town hall. Our thanks to former Vice President Joe Biden as well as to our participants here in Miami and all of you at home, we should note that well before the president’s stillness we extended an invitation to him to participate in a town hall with us as well. That invitation still stands. There’s a busy road ahead in the run up to election day, including the vice presidential debate just 48 hours from now with Mike Pence and Kamala Harris.

         "Joe Biden: (17:15)\nGood afternoon, everyone. It’s great to be back in Miami. And thank you, Esther. I told you our family has been, unfortunately, this considerable consumer of healthcare. Please all sit down. Of healthcare and I’ve learned from personal experience as my sons, my daughter, my wife, family has learned if there are any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses, male and female. Docs let you live and nurses make you want to live. I really mean it. They’re there at the tough times. And by the way, thank you for your service in the military, but also thank you for the beginning of this pandemic.\nJoe Biden: (18:10)\nBeing a surgical nurse wasn’t easy when there wasn’t the PPE available to all of you as you walked into those operating rooms and dealt with all the problems. I know my son-in-law’s a physician surgeon in Philadelphia and the stories at the beginning of this process, when we should have had everything available. So thank you not only for your skill and your courage, but your bravery and doing what you’ve done. And I want to thank you for the care dedication that you went on, all your fellow SEIU members, all your nurses that show up and struggle with illness or coping with the loss of a loved one in terrible times.\nJoe Biden: (18:56)\nSo many of you had to hold a phone to a patient’s ear to say goodbye to a family member because they couldn’t be there. They couldn’t see them in the hospital as they passed. Now, I want to thank Victoria, Victoria for sharing her family’s journey with us today. Victoria and I were talking a little bit earlier. I was in South Asia speaking with a president and he asked me what made America unique? And I said immigration because it’s the history of this country. And he looked at me funny. He said, why is that?\nJoe Biden: (19:37)\nAnd I said, because almost everybody who’s come here, other than those who came in chains 400 years ago came because they’re escaping something and it took enormous courage. I really mean this. Think about it, enormous courage to leave everything they knew, everything that was familiar, sometimes leaving family members to get on a boat, a plane, train, whatever the means was to be able to leave and start a new life. And to do that, you have to have optimism, courage. You have to be resilient. You have to be willing to believe you can make things change for the better.\nJoe Biden: (20:17)\nThat’s what’s built this country, immigration. We are, not figuratively, it’s a phrase used to not often fully appreciated, a nation of immigrants. That’s why we’re the most unique and strongest nation in the world. It’s family like yours and Esther’s that have made this country what it is through the hard work and faith and perseverance. The richness and beauty of Miami is built from the connections of family, culture, values that we share with our friends throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Earlier this afternoon, I visited Little Haiti.\nJoe Biden: (20:53)\nHad been some years since been there when the earthquake occurred and I came to deliver some assistance to the Haitian community, as well as making sure we had temporary protective status granted. It’s a cultural complex and now here at the site name for one of Cuba’s most celebrated poets and thinkers. This city is living proof of the incredible strength that we draw from families and communities from every culture choosing America. So thank you, Victoria, for choosing us and I’m really honored that you’re going to vote for me in your first election.\nJoe Biden: (21:33)\nI promise you I will not let you down. I promise you I will not let you down. And let me also say at the top, my prayers continue to be with the president and the first lady for their health and safety as they like so many American families are dealing with COVID-19. I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend. Now that he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this, listen to the scientists, support masks, support a mask mandate nationwide, require a mask in every federal building and facility and interstate travel, urge every governor, mayor to do the same.\nJoe Biden: (22:21)\nWe know it saves lives. His administration just rejected a mask mandate for public transportation on Friday. The CIA came along and said, we need to be protected and they said, no. I believe that was wrong and not very rational experts say that universal masking could say between now and January 100,000 lives. Let me say that again. Between now and January, mandatory masking could save 100,000 lives. I backed that mandate months ago. He should back it now. Since the president entered the hospital on Friday, since Friday, more than 100,000 more people have been diagnosed with COVID.\nJoe Biden: (23:19)\nAnd this week, at least 5,000 more will die. Cases and deaths are climbing in many states. I hope the president’s recovery is swift and successful, but our nation’s covered crisis is far, far from over. Today, my prayers are with the families of the 210,000 Americans who died from the virus. All those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair at the breakfast table, tonight, an empty chair at the dinner table where one should be, husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father. And nearly 7.5 million Americans-\nJoe Biden: (24:02)\nAnd nearly 7.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus to date. This pandemic and economic collapse has hit the Hispanic communities, particularly hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Hispanics is almost three times higher than white, non Hispanics. More than 40,000 Hispanics have died from COVID-19, devastating families and close knit communities of loved ones. And here in Florida, where Hispanics make up about one quarter of the population, they make up 37% of the COVID deaths.\nJoe Biden: (24:44)\nNearly 3 million Hispanics are unemployed. If you break that down, that last data, unemployment for Hispanic women and Hispanic youth actually went up last month. One in three Hispanic, small business owners have taken a hit and many are likely to have to close permanently. Some economists are calling this what they call a K shaped recovery. It means those at the top, they keep going up, their income. But everyone from the middle and lower-income, it keeps going down, keeps getting worse. Means that essential workers, so many of whom are Hispanic, have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern American history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a shocking statistic, but it’s true, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just since the COVID crisis they have made an additional $300 billion. The top 100 additional made an additional $300 billion. Everyone else though, they got the bottom half of that K, downward, a downward slide.\nJoe Biden: (26:09)\nYou’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay your bills, put food on the table, pay the rent, or if you’re lucky enough to own a home, will you have enough money to pay the mortgage? How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids, because their school has gone remote. You’re asked to risk your neck if you can’t work from home, while the risk of COVID are mostly kept outside, because you’re one of our first responders, a union nurse like Ester or on an assembly line, or working in a customer service or tourism industry or at a checkout counter or police office, firefighter. I know this isn’t an easy time, but I also think this pandemic has just helped us rip off the blinders in this country as how inequitable so many things are. People didn’t even realize, and so now they’ve seen it.\nJoe Biden: (27:16)\nI truly believe we have a tremendous opportunity to turn this moment of crisis in a moment of great progress for the country. That’s why I’ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to build them back, make bold investments in them so we can build back better than before the crisis.\nJoe Biden: (27:40)\nAn independent analysis, President talks about… he loves talking about Wall Street. He never talks about Moody’s on wall street that pointed out, they did a detailed assessment of my economic plan and his. And here’s what Moody’s concluded. They projected my economic plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more jobs in the president’s economic plan will in four years and $1 trillion more in growth than the president’s plan.\nJoe Biden: (28:14)\nAnd here’s how it works. I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. You won’t pay a penny more. I guarantee you. But I’m going to ask the big corporations and the super wealthy to begin to pay their fair share. It’s not punishment. It just about time you start paying your fair share. The money we raise from making sure they pay their fair share will allow me to invest it in working people on a growing middle class.\nJoe Biden: (28:50)\nWhen I announced I said I wanted to rebuild the backbone of this country. Working folks, the middle class. They weren’t built by wall street. It was built by labor. Advance racial equity across the economy to make sure everyone is included in the deal this time. We’re going to invest it in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs in manufacturing and technology, making sure our future is made in America. In infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, and airports like I was able to do when I ran the Recovery Act for our administration, putting billions of dollars in the Port of Miami, creating so good, hard working people with good decent union jobs, able to accommodate the new supertankers coming through the canal, generating some stability.\nJoe Biden: (29:50)\nMy plan will make sure Hispanic communities benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, to fill the cracks in the sidewalks, install broadband, close the digital divide, create spaces to live, work, and play in safely.\nJoe Biden: (30:07)\nAnd clean energy. We upgrade 4 million buildings, weatherize 2 million homes. We’ll create, at least, the estimates are at least 1 million good paying jobs and save us millions and millions of barrels of oil. We’re going to meet the threat of climate change and invest in strengthening climate resilience, where we are already dealing with an existential threat of climate change. I don’t have to tell you in Miami, don’t have to tell you in South Florida or in my state, which has the lowest sea level, lowest degree of height from sea level than any state in the nation. Stronger, more frequent hurricanes, rising tides, flooding. And no matter where the president says, maybe you should consider dropping an atomic weapon on a hurricane coming our way is not a good idea. It doesn’t work. Look, that’s not some distant future in Miami or South Florida. You’re dealing with it right now. What do you have to do to get knocked in the head to understand it?\nJoe Biden: (31:18)\nWe’re going to make sure the small businesses could come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. My plan will get $50 billion in capital flowing to small businesses, which would get repaid in employment and taxes, especially minority owned small businesses and make another $100 billion in low interest loans available to those businesses to get back on their feet and stay alive, because you know as well as I do, and ethnic communities, they are the heartbeat, they’re the center of a community. Whether it’s a grocery store, a beauty shop, the barbershop, the hardware store, the essence of a community. We’re going to make investments to increase incomes as well. It’s long past time. I’ve worked with Governor Cuomo to get it done in New York and other governors across the country. No one should have to work two jobs to be able to be 40 hours a week, so they’re above the poverty rate. $15 should be a minimum wage in the United States of America, period.\nJoe Biden: (32:29)\nAnd for our essential workers, we’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to begin to pay you a good wage, be sure you have strong benefits. We’re going to ease the burden of the major costs in your life. What are they? Healthcare. We’re going to build on the Affordable Care Act, which gave 4 million Hispanic people in this country health insurance, by adding a new health insurance option, a not for profit public option. We’re going to give private insurers a real competitor. We’re going to increase subsidies, so your premiums are lower and you can and afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses.\nJoe Biden: (33:10)\nWe’re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry, a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. You think I’m making these numbers up. If we just let Medicare negotiate independently for all the drugs they purchase, I promise you the rates are going to fall through the floor. Affordable and accessible.\nJoe Biden: (33:33)\nEvery three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. All the studies at great universities and all the ones around the country have shown that no matter what zip code a child comes from, no matter what background, if they go to preschool, not daycare, preschool in school at three, four, and five years old, they increase exponentially, over by over 50% a prospect they’ll go through all 12 years and many beyond.\nJoe Biden: (34:04)\nAnd we’ll make sure, sure that low and middle-income… and by the way, the total cost of that… it’s called Title 1 program. We now spend $15 billion for in school districts that don’t have high tax rates. Well, guess what? You change that to 45. You can put every one of these kids in school, pay the teachers legitimate rate and make sure that you have school psychologists and social workers in those schools. We’re going to make sure that for childcare, for someone under the age of five or six, no one ever has to pay more than 7% of their income for their young children to get quality childcare, because you truly want to reward work in this country. We have to ease the financial burden of the care that families are carrying. Even before the pandemic, and many of you know it and many of you are doing it, millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strains, trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability.\nJoe Biden: (35:04)\nIt’s going to sound strange, when I first got elected, when I was 29 years old to Senate, right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed. My two sons survived after hospitalized for a long time. I needed help do my job. I could not possibly afford childcare. Even though I was making a really good salary of $42,000 a year, more than I’d ever made. And I couldn’t afford it. Being a single mom or dad or a family that has two people working with young children, it’s incredibly costly. And by the way, and the professional caregivers out there, home health workers, childcare workers, were more often women, women of color and immigrants, and too often underpaid, unseen and undervalued. That’s why my build back better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiver-\nJoe Biden: (36:03)\n… Back Better Plan will elevate the compensation benefits and dignity of caregivers and workers and early childhood educators. That’s what we’re going to do. It’s also going to invest in education beyond high school. If you qualify to get into community college, you’ll automatically be able to go, and you’ll be able to go for free. If you are qualified to get into a four-year public school in your state public college, and your family makes less than $125, 000 a year, you get to go free. If you’re buying your first home, you’re going to have a tax credit up to $15,000 to get there. What happened after the Great Recession in this one? An awful lot of you range in age from the millennials have started off back after 9/11, all the way to the people graduating this year… Are not in a position to do that, because your jobs have been postponed or non-existent. But providing an opportunity, I can get you into the system.\nJoe Biden: (37:09)\nWe’re also going to protect Social Security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors. We’re going to do that all in a partnership and lockstep with the Hispanic community. And by the way, the President’s proposal to eliminate the tax you pay when you get your paycheck for Social Security, without any means by which to replace it, the actuary at social security said Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023. They’ve never liked it to begin with. So look, success and prosperity of the Hispanic Americans is indispensable to the success and prosperity of the United States, and of all America. It’s that simple. Hispanic families are responsible today for $2.6 trillion of our gross domestic product, and growing. If that was a standalone economy, a country all by itself, it would be the eighth largest economy in the world. Think of that.\nJoe Biden: (38:20)\nNow imagine how much more that would grow if everyone had access to the tools they need to succeed. By investing in Hispanic communities, we’re making the smartest possible investment with the greatest possible returns that our nation could make, period. We also need to rebuild our ability to work with our partners throughout the Western hemisphere to realize the enormous potential of this region in the world, to confront those leaders who continue to oppress the rights of their people. We should be leading the international effort to confront the massive humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. Maduro, who I’ve met, is a dictator, plain and simple, and he’s causing incredible suffering among the Venezuelan people to maintain his grip on power. The Venezuelan people need our support to recover or their democracy and rebuild their country.\nJoe Biden: (39:19)\nThat’s why I would immediately grant temporary protective status to Venezuelans as President. So the Republicans in the Senate can’t keep blocking it like they did again just last week. I’ll make sure we’re supporting neighboring countries that are being overrun with immigration because of Maduro, like Columbia, which are caring for millions of Venezuelans who’ve fled their country in desperation. I’ll use sanctions as one of the tools for a comprehensive strategy that includes humanitarian assistance, international pressure, and support for democratic actors in Venezuela to force the regime to embark on the road to a free and fair election. We also need a new Cuba policy. The administration’s approach is not working. Cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago. The fact there’s more political prisoners, the secret police are as brutal as ever, and Russia is once again a major presence in Cuba in Havana… For my entire career, I strived for democracy and human rights, for freedom of the press, assembly and religion against dictators of the left and the right. As President, my policy will be governed by two principles.\nJoe Biden: (40:40)\nFirst, Americans, especially Cuban-Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom in Cuba. Second, empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future is central to a national security interest in the United States. I think it’s unconscionable that the current administration is deporting hundreds of Cubans back to a dictatorship. There are almost 10,000 Cubans languishing in tent camps along the Mexican border because the administration’s anti-immigration agenda. That’s the administration actively separating Cuban families by not processing visas, through restrictions on family visits and remittances. I think we have to reverse that. The bottom line is that President Trump can not advance the democracy and human rights for the American people when he has embraced so many autocrats around the world, starting with Vladimir Putin.\nJoe Biden: (41:40)\nFolks, we can do this. We can reach for more as a nation. We can rebuild. We can rebuild the backbone of this country and finally bring everybody along. America’s always done best coming out of crisis. We’re the only nation it’s always come out of every crisis better than we went in. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, including Hispanic communities. And Hispanic voters, especially in Florida, can help put our nation on a new path forward. And here in Florida today as the deadline to register to vote ends today… If you haven’t registered, go out right now because it is an obligation. Every vote will make a difference. Check and make sure your family and friends are registered, and then make sure everyone has a plan to vote.\nJoe Biden: (42:44)\nIf you can vote by mail, vote by mail. If you can vote in person, vote in person, if you can vote early, vote early. You can vote early in person starting on October 19th in many places in Florida, including right here in Miami. Just make sure you vote. Together we can win. We can’t let this pandemic change everything. We’ve got to get it under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. We can come together as a nation. I’m running as a Democrat. Proud of it, but I will be an American President, not a democratic President with a capital D. I’ll fight as hard for you and your family whether you vote for me or whether you vote against me because there’s nothing we can’t do when we do it together.\nJoe Biden: (43:34)\nFolks, I’ve been other more optimistic about our chances as a nation in the 21st century than I’ve been my whole career. There’s not a single solitary thing that’s beyond our capacities as a nation. I mean that sincerely. The most talented workers in the world… We’re the most incredible system in the world. We have a people, who when they stand together, have never, ever, ever, ever failed. Every time I’d walk out of my grandpa’s house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” My grandma, when she was alive, would yell back, “No, Joey, spread it.” Let’s go spread the faith. Take back this country. We’re so much better than this. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you.\nJoe Biden: (44:34)\n(music)",

         "Bernie Sanders: (00:01)\nBut if these were normal times, and we were one month away from the general election, as we are today, we would have even more people out for a rally. That’s kind of what I think. But as you know, these are not normal times. We are struggling with the worst pandemic to hit this country in 100 years, a pandemic that has already cost us over 200,000 lives, and over 7,000 right here in the state of Michigan. And for that reason, the city of Ann Arbor correctly has established strong guidelines as to how many people can come together for an event, and those are guidelines which makes sense to me in which I support. So the result of that is, instead of having 10,000 people or more out today, we have, I’m guessing, 25 people here, all of them wearing masks, all of them social distancing themselves. And this event is essentially a virtual rally being live streamed throughout the state and throughout the country. And that is the world we are living in today.\nBernie Sanders: (01:33)\nWhat the last few days have told us is that if there was ever any doubt, it should now be clear that no one, no one is safe from this terrible pandemic. Doesn’t matter if you are a frontline worker in a hospital, and today we thank all of the doctors, and nurses, and medical personnel for the extraordinary sacrifices they have made, and in some cases given up their lives for us in this pandemic. And it doesn’t matter if you are an essential worker, critical worker at a supermarket helping us get the food that we need, or a bus driver, if you’re a worker in a meat packing plant. And it doesn’t matter if you are the President of the United States of America. Each and every one of us is vulnerable, and we will remain vulnerable until there is a vaccine or a perfected cure. That is the reality that we face, and there is no getting away from that.\nBernie Sanders: (02:54)\nNow, there are some who say that we have to make a choice between having a strong economy on one hand, and protecting the American people from this terrible disease on the other hand. I disagree. The truth is that we will never have a strong economy so long as this pandemic continues to surge. We will never have a strong economy if people are afraid to go to work, if people are afraid to go to school, if people are afraid to shop or go out to a restaurant, or afraid to do all of the things that have always been done. We will never have a strong economy unless we get this pandemic under control. Is the solution to this crisis to shut down the economy and lock everyone in their homes? No, it is not. We can keep our country moving forward. If we do so in a way that is disciplined, not dangerous, that is responsible, not reckless, and if we listen to the science.\nBernie Sanders: (04:40)\nAnd now, importantly, I want you to take a moment and to ask yourselves some very simple questions, and I really want you to think about your answers because there is probably no issue out there more important than this. Which candidate for president has shown that he will be disciplined, that he will be responsible, that he will do his best to protect the people around him as we deal with this pandemic? And the answer is Joe Biden. Which candidate for president has made it clear that he will develop policies which are based on science, not politics, and that he will seek the advice of the best scientists and doctors in our country and around the world in order to combat and defeat this pandemic? And the answer to that question is Joe Biden.\nBernie Sanders: (06:08)\nWhich candidate for president will develop strong national protocols and guidelines and model the behaviors we all need to engage in to keep our families, our coworkers, and our neighbors safe? And the answer is Joe Biden. Which candidate has the temperament to see us through this unprecedented moment, the worst public health crisis in over 100 years? Let me repeat that question. Which candidate has the temperament to see us through this difficult crisis? I don’t think there is any doubt that the answer to that question is Joe Biden. And my friends, that is why we need Joe Biden as our next president.\nBernie Sanders: (07:18)\nAnd now let me say, if I might, a special word to the young people of our country. During the last year and a half, I have had the extraordinary opportunity to travel all across this country in almost every state in the union. And what I have learned is that the young generation in our country today, Black and white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, is an extraordinarily beautiful group of people. It is the most progressive, the most compassionate, the most open minded young generation in the history of our country. It is a generation that thinks big, not small, and is prepared for a new vision as to what our country can and must become. And that vision is based on the principles of justice, economic justice, racial justice, social justice, environmental justice.\nBernie Sanders: (08:55)\nThis is a generation that is leading the fight against systemic racism and police brutality. It is a generation that is leading the fight against xenophobia, a generation that is leading the fight against sexism. A generation that is leading the fight against religious bigotry. A generation that is leading the fight against never ending wars, and a bloated military budget. And this is a generation, unlike the current President of the United States, that knows that climate change is real, that it is imperative that we stand up to the fossil fuel industry, and that we are going to need bold action in order to create a planet-\nBernie Sanders: (10:03)\n… in order to create a planet that will be healthy for our children and grandchildren. This generation, younger generation, understands all of that.\nBernie Sanders: (10:20)\nBut, and here is the but, as wonderful and idealistic as how a young generation is, it has one major political shortcoming. And that political shortcoming is that this young generation does not vote in large enough numbers. The voter turnout among young people has improved in the last few years, but it still has a very long way to go. So today, I say to the young people here in Michigan and around the country, if you are worried about the outrageous level of student debt that many of you are incurring, if you are upset about the high cost of college and graduate school, if you are concerned about the low paying jobs that many of you have, if you are concerned and worried about climate change, sexism, racism, homophobia, and religious bigotry, it is not enough to complain or to moan and groan. We’ve got to fight back and the first way is to vote. And not only to vote, but to vote in record breaking numbers. Let me say this again to the younger generation, that if you vote at the same percentages as older people in this country vote, not only will Biden win this election, we will transform this country. The future of America depends upon you. Now all over this country, as many of you know, in many Republican controlled states, and this makes me really very sad, officials in a variety of ways are trying to suppress the vote. They’re cowardly. They are trying to make it harder for working people, poor people, people of color, and young people to vote. They want a low voter turnout because they think that will help them politically.\nBernie Sanders: (12:55)\nFortunately, that is not the case here in Michigan. In Michigan, not only has early voting already begun in every township in the state, but you can still register to vote online until October 19th and in person until election day, same day registration. In other words, you can vote or register to vote right now, no matter where you live in the state. In addition, there are, opening today, new polling sites near three college campuses, East Lansing near MSU, as well as on campus at Western Michigan University and Northern Michigan University. Further, Detroit is opening 21 early voting sites across the city, which will be open seven days a week until election day.\nBernie Sanders: (14:20)\nMy friends, this is the most important election in the modern history of our country. It is imperative that Joe Biden wins, that we have a Democratic house, including Debbie Dingell, and that we have a Democratic Senate, including your Senator Gary Peters, who must be reelected.\nBernie Sanders: (14:50)\nNow, I don’t have to remind anyone here or in Michigan that in 2016, Donald Trump won this state and its 16 electoral votes by two tenths of 1%. Two tenths of 1%. The stakes are just too high. We cannot allow that to happen again. So if anybody has doubts about whether their vote matters, remember what happened in 2016. 10,000 votes in Michigan. So your vote matters. In fact, it can be decisive in determining the future, not only here in Michigan, but because you are a major battleground state, what happens here can well determine the future of the entire United States of America.\nBernie Sanders: (15:56)\nNow let me say a word as to why this election is so, so very important. And I don’t have to tell anyone that the young people in our country have been dealt some extraordinarily odd blows throughout their young lives. In fact, young Americans have now lived through the two worst economic crises since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 12 years ago, young people all over this country had to deal with the Wall Street crash that caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs, lose their homes, and lose their life savings. And many have never fully recovered from that crash of 12 years ago.\nBernie Sanders: (16:49)\nAnd today, right now, young people are being hit by the massive economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During this pandemic right now, 54% of young Americans under the age of 29, have either lost a job or had to take a pay cut more than any other age group. 52% of young Americans have been forced to move back home with their parents. 35% of young Americans have had problems finding enough money to pay for rent, medical bills, or other expenses. Unless we reverse course, everything being equal, the younger generation will for the first time in the modern history of our country have a lower standard of living than their parents because this country right now is experiencing massive downward mobility. We want to go up, not down.\nBernie Sanders: (18:09)\nYoung Americans today are making less money than their parents did when they entered the workforce. They have smaller savings accounts. They are less likely to own their own homes as the cost of housing has gone up and up and up. They are drowning in student debt for what reason? That they chose to do the right thing and get a college education. And even though young workers are more likely than ever to have a college degree, the jobs they have are not paying them the wages or salaries they need to have an adequate standard of living. And many of the jobs that they have have been hard hit by the pandemic. A majority of bartenders in America are young, half of all restaurant workers in America are young. A huge percentage of the retail sector is filled with young people. And these are precisely the industries that have been hit the hardest by the economic downturn.\nBernie Sanders: (19:22)\nIn other words, while many millions of young people are struggling to pay off outrageous high levels of student debt, many of them are forced to work for wages that are much too low if they are lucky enough to have a job at all. And if we do not get our act together soon, this very bad situation will become even worse because according to the Department of Labor, the occupations that will create the most jobs in America over the next decade are home healthcare aids, fast food work-\nBernie Sanders: (20:03)\n… decade, are home health care aides, fast food workers and cooks, jobs that pay low wages and don’t require a college degree. Let me be as clear as I can possibly be and that is, that in the richest country in the history of the world, we have got to do better than that. We need to create an economy and a government that work for all of us, not just the 1% and wealthy campaign contributors.\nBernie Sanders: (20:39)\nNow it is no secret, no great secret at all, that Joe Biden and I have differences of opinion. And as a United States Senator, make no mistake about it, I will continue to fight for the principles that I have advocated for a very long time, I ain’t going away. But I also want to tell you that in fairness to Joe, if his campaign proposals were to be implemented they would significantly improve the lives of tens of millions of working families and would make Joe Biden the most progressive president of the United States since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And frankly, I don’t think our campaign has done a good enough job in talking about what Joe is fighting for, so let me take a few minutes to do that.\nBernie Sanders: (21:51)\nWhen Joe Biden is president, this is what is clearly in his state of principles, when Joe is president, he will make public colleges, universities, and trade schools tuition free for working families, and he will substantially reduce student debt in America. Under Joe’s plan, if you attended a four year public college or university, and you earn less than $125,000 a year, he will cancel your student debt. Joe understands that every working class and middle class young person should be able to get a higher education regardless of the income of their families.\nBernie Sanders: (22:52)\nUnlike the current president, Joe Biden understands that climate change is real, that it is caused by human activity and that we have got to move aggressively to transform our energy system. And that is why Joe is proposing $2 trillion to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel towards energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And by the way, when we make that investment, we create millions of good paying jobs in this country.\nBernie Sanders: (23:34)\nAnd when we talk about the need to raise wages in America, let’s be clear, when Joe Biden is president, we are going to raise the federal minimum wage from the starvation wage of seven and a quarter an hour to a living wage of at least $15 an hour. Joe understands that if you work 40 hours a week, you should not be living in poverty. And Joe also understands that it is absurd that women in America are earning 80 cents on the dollar compared to men. Joe believes, you believe and I believe, equal pay for equal work.\nBernie Sanders: (24:40)\nAnd Joe also knows that if we are going to expand the middle class in this country, we must make it easier for workers to join unions to engage in collective bargaining and to end the heavy handed corporate tactics that make it so hard for workers to unionize in our country. And Joe Biden also understands that we have got to stop providing corporate welfare to companies that are throwing American workers out on the street and moving to low wage countries around the world. When Joe is president, he will sign an executive order to prevent companies that ship American jobs overseas from receiving a nickel in corporate welfare.\nBernie Sanders: (25:40)\nAnd I’ll tell you what Joe Biden also understands and what all of you know to be true, and that is we have got to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid medical and family leave. How absurd is it? How absurd is it that the wealthiest country in the world cannot guarantee paid family and medical leave to its workers? When a woman in this country gives birth, she should not be forced to go back to work after one or two weeks. When a child gets sick, mom or dad should be able to stay home and not lose a day’s pay, and that is why Joe Biden has proposed at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for working families in our country.\nBernie Sanders: (26:55)\nAnd when we talk about little kids and young children, we all know that our current childcare system is a disgrace and is totally inadequate. Our children and their parents deserve high quality, reliable and affordable childcare. And that is why Joe has proposed universal pre-K education for every three and four year old in the country.\nBernie Sanders: (27:37)\nAnd some of you may recall, early in this campaign, I traveled to Canada with a group of diabetics to buy insulin, a life and death drug for more than 30 million Americans. And in fact, that trip with diabetics began in Detroit, Michigan, and here is what we found on that trip, and it’s something I will never forget. And that is you can go 15 miles into Canada and you can buy insulin there for 1/10th of the price that it is sold here in the United States. No, you didn’t miss hear me. I said, you can buy insulin in Canada for 1/10th of the price that it is sold here. Same company, same product, 1/10th of the price. And it’s not just Canada and it’s not just insulin.\nBernie Sanders: (28:48)\nWhile the drug companies through their collusion, through their price fixing and through their greed make obscene profits every year, we end up paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans who get a prescription from a doctor cannot afford to fill that prescription, how insane is that? Joe Biden understands that we finally must have the courage to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower the outrageous prices of prescription drugs in this country.\nBernie Sanders: (29:43)\nAs I think many of you know, the United States is the only major country on earth, not to guarantee healthcare for all people as a human right. Meanwhile, despite paying almost twice as much per capita for healthcare as the people of…\nBernie Sanders: (30:03)\n… much per capita for healthcare as the people of other countries. Over 90 million Americans today are uninsured or underinsured, and almost a half a million Americans go bankrupt because they cannot afford to pay their medical bills. And I’ll tell you something else, an outrage beyond belief, that because of the high cost of healthcare in America, some 60,000 of our people die every single year because they don’t get to a doctor when they’re sick. They just can’t afford to walk into a doctor’s office. How outrageous is that?\nBernie Sanders: (30:47)\nNow, Joe and I disagree in the best path to get to universal coverage. I believe in Medicare for all. But while Joe and I disagree, I know that he will greatly expand access to healthcare and make it more affordable for tens of millions of people across this country. He will make sure that everyone in America has access to a public option similar to Medicare. He will lower the eligibility age of Medicare from 65 to 60, no small thing. He will expand Medicare to cover dental care and eyeglasses and hearing aids, and he will substantially increase funding for community health centers to make sure that millions of Americans get the primary healthcare and mental health care that they desperately need. Joe understands, as you understand, as I understand, as Debbie Dingle understands, that when you talk about healthcare it’s not just cancer and a broken leg, it is mental health care as well. Joe Biden also understands that we must end systemic racism in this country, and that we cannot continue to have more people in jail than any other country on earth. And that is why Joe will end private prisons in America and private detention centers. And that is why we will make sure that no one in America sits in a jail cell because they are too poor to afford cash bail. Instead of more jails and incarceration, Joe understands that we need more jobs and more education.\nBernie Sanders: (33:10)\nJoe Biden also understands that we are a nation of immigrants. My dad came to this country at the age of 17, and that we cannot continue to terrorize and demonize over 11 million undocumented people in America. And that is why Joe has proposed a comprehensive immigration reform plan, and a path toward citizenship for the undocumented. That is why he will provide legal status for the 1.8 million young people eligible for the DOCA program, and that is why he will end the disastrous ICE raids and develop a humane border policy for those who seek asylum. No more snatching babies from the arms of their mothers.\nBernie Sanders: (34:14)\nMy friends, in this unprecedented moment in American history. Let us reject those who want to divide us up based on the color of our skin, or our religion, or our sexual orientation, or the country of our birth. Let us come together as never before, black and white, latino, Asian American, Native American, gay and straight, those of us who were born in this country, those of us who emigrated here. Let us come together to elect a democratic congress. Let us come together to enact the most progressive agenda in the modern history of this country. Let us come together to build an America that works for all and not just the billionaire class. And let us elect Joe Biden as the next president of the United States of America.\nBernie Sanders: (35:33)\nThank you all very much.",

         "Judi (Moderator): (00:15)\nBecause camera angles can be deceiving I want to assure our audience watching this evening that the candidate podiums are 13 feet apart this evening. Also, we are following all CDC protocols for tonight’s debate. A coin toss determined the order of opening statements. Mr. Harrison, you won that toss. The next minute on the floor is yours.\nJaime Harrison: (00:35)\nThank you. Thank you so much, Judi. And I want to thank everyone here on the campus of Allen University. While I breathe, I hope, that’s the motto of this great state South Carolina, but it might as well be the theme of my entire life. I’m a son of a teen mom. I was raised by grandparents with a fourth grade and eighth-grade education. I went to Yale, the first in my family. I went to Georgetown Law School. I worked on Capitol Hill. I worked for private sector and now I’m a candidate for the United States Senate. Excuse me, if I pinch myself a little bit. I’ve lived the American dream and I’ve spent my entire life fighting for others to make sure that they do the same thing.\nJaime Harrison: (01:15)\nWe’ve been divided for too long. Too many folks here in South Carolina lack the opportunity to live the American dream themselves. Tonight you will probably hear from Lindsey Graham and he will scare you to vote for him. I hope tonight to inspire you to support me.\nJudi (Moderator): (01:33)\nThank you, Sir. Senator Graham, one minute.\nLindsey Graham: (01:35)\nThank you. You have nothing to be afraid about when it comes to me. Thank you very much for tuning in. Thank you to Allen University. Thank you to everybody who’s gotten me here. We live in difficult times. 2020 is the most incredible year. We’ve been challenged like no other time. Coronavirus has turned our state and nation upside down. Mr. Harrison lost an aunt. The President of the United States is in the hospital as I speak. We’re going to get through this. When I was 21 my mom died of cancer, 15 months later, my dad died. I was in charge of a 13-year-old sister. My whole world came crashing down but I made it. We got drug therapies that are working, mortality rates are going down, a vaccine is around the corner. This is a big choice election between me and Mr. Harrison. Capitalism versus socialism. Conservative judges versus liberal judges. Law and order versus chaos.\nJudi (Moderator): (02:35)\nThank you, sir.\nLindsey Graham: (02:36)\nYou know where I stand.\nJudi (Moderator): (02:37)\nThank you very much. Gentlemen, thank you both again for being here this evening. It is our hope and our expectation to give our nation and our children an example of what civil discourse looks like and how to engage in passionate but respectful debate. So we’ll thank you for that in advance.\nJudi (Moderator): (02:53)\nSenator Graham, the first question to you and will have Mr. Harrison answer as well. In the last 24 hours, the list of public officials infected by COVID-19 has grown exponentially. People of faith are and goodwill across our country are certainly praying for everyone infected to make a full recovery, but it cannot be ignored that many people who are infected attended large gatherings and completely disregarded the protocols put out by the CDC. The question is how has politicization of the virus damaged our response federally and here in our state?\nLindsey Graham: (03:29)\nWell, here’s what I would say, that President Wilson got the Spanish flu right after World War I, and we live in such unusual times I doubt if anybody yet attacked him. All I can say is that the virus is a problem that came out of China, not Trump Tower, that we’re getting vaccines ready I think any months now, hopefully even sooner. The drug therapies are working. The one thing I want people to know is that the virus is serious, but we have to move on as a nation. When a military member gets infected, you don’t shut down the whole unit.\nLindsey Graham: (04:03)\nWe’re going to have a hearing for Amy Barrett, the nominee to the Supreme Court. It will be done safely. But I’ve got a job to do and I’m pressing on. And the one thing I find odd, nobody asked me, how are you doing Senator Graham, when 200 people showed up at my house and broke my window. My liberal democratic friends never mention the virus when people roaming around the streets rioting and burning down cop cars and breaking windows. It is a problem. It’s a problem for the nation. It is something we’re going to get through. But I promise you, we’re not going to stop doing our job in Washington. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I promise you we’re going to get Judge Barrett on the court safely.\nJudi (Moderator): (04:45)\nThank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Mr. Harrison, the same question to you.\nJaime Harrison: (04:48)\nThis question is about the coronavirus, not Judge Barrett, not the Supreme Court. This has impacted me personally, Judi. My grand aunt, Gladys passed away this July in a nursing home by herself. That is the story that so many Americans are experiencing right now. And part of why we’re experiencing … No, we’re not going to blame the president. We shouldn’t blame the president. We shouldn’t blame anybody for the inception of this disease. But where blame should come is how we handled this disease, whether or not we take it seriously. Tonight, I am taking it seriously. That’s why I put this plexiglass up because it’s not just about me, it’s about the people in my life that I have to take care of as well, my two boys, my wife, my grandmother. We need to make sure we are addressing the issue here in South Carolina. We have had 750,000 people unemployed here in South Carolina because of the COVID. We’ve had 3,000 people to die. We’ve had over a hundred thousand to be infected. Let’s take this issue seriously and do all that we can to not only take care of ourselves but each other.\nJudi (Moderator): (05:58)\nI want to ask the next question, a follow-up about the coronavirus and the impact specifically here in South Carolina. Governor Henry McMaster has asked South Carolina schools to resume five days to face instruction. And quite frankly, I have talked to many teachers and parents who want to do the very same if it’s done safely. Here’s the concern, Senator Graham, you and your colleagues, I know you had a coronavirus test either yesterday or today and the other officials that we’re hearing about. You get your results in a matter of hours. Here in South Carolina, people are waiting for days, sometimes more than a week to get results. And we know how critical that is in terms of containing the virus. The question is, should we ask our teachers to return to class for five day face-to-face instruction without having access to widespread, rapid testing, to quickly identify and contain those cases in schools?\nLindsey Graham: (06:49)\nI think we should allow our parents to make a decision about what’s best for their children. And if a teacher doesn’t want to go back to the classroom, I won’t make them. I’ve supported legislation that increased unemployment benefits because people lost their job at no fault of their own. I’ve been trying to get our PPP, the mask, gloves that were all in China, back in America, and let American textile companies make it here at home so we’re not so dependent.\nLindsey Graham: (07:15)\nBut the one thing we’re not going to do if I’m your Senator is shut the country down. We’re going to open up safely. We’re now getting back to business here in South Carolina. Shutting the country down has a effect of its own, alcoholism up, domestic violence. So we’re going to handle this virus. But this issue about how to rebuild America, who do you trust Donald Trump who gave you the best economy before the virus? Or do you trust liberal Democrats? And let me tell you the nightmare scenario for our state. If they keep the House, take over the Senate and Biden’s president, God help us all. And Mr. Harrison’s a Democratic Senator. The most liberal agenda in the history of American politics is coming out of the House to the Senate. Medicare for all takes away your private healthcare. They’re going to stack the Supreme Court. You got to understand what’s at stake here.\nJudi (Moderator): (08:07)\nThank you, sir. Your time has expired. Thank you very much. Mr. Harrison, the same question to you. Should we ask our teachers to return to five day face-to-face instruction without first having access to widespread rapid testing?\nJaime Harrison: (08:18)\nAs a father of two boys and one that is in first grade for the first time, it’s hard. Teaching your kids from home is very, very difficult. If nobody has an appreciation of teachers or didn’t before the coronavirus, they’d better have an appreciation right now. We need a strategy, a 50-state strategy. And the failure of leadership, again, we’re not blaming anybody for the inception of this, but the failure of leadership of addressing us. We failed to act. The Senate failed to act. The White House failed to that. The governors failed to act. We need leaders who are going to step up and act. We need testing here in South Carolina. We need to make sure that we have a mandate that said, “Folks, please just wear your mask so that we can bring down the transmission of this virus and then open our economy back up.”\nJaime Harrison: (09:09)\nRight now so many families have so many issues that they’re dealing with, Judi. Again, 750,000 people unemployed. And Senator Graham said over our dead bodies will we allow a federal extension of the unemployment benefit. Folks need that money. The small businesses need that money, but we need leadership in order to get the things that are so necessary for our families to open back up.\nJudi (Moderator): (09:32)\nThank you, sir. We want to bring-\nLindsey Graham: (09:33)\n[inaudible 00:09:33].\nJudi (Moderator): (09:34)\nHe did mention your name. You have 45 seconds if you’d like to provide a rebuttal.\nLindsey Graham: (09:37)\nNumber one, I supported the phase three, but I said then that if you pay people more not to work than the work, you’re going to have a problem. And it turned out to be true. Joe Cunningham understands, the Democrat in Charleston. It’s been really hard on hotels and restaurants to get back in business when you’re paying people more to be unemployed than to be employed. I want to help people. I want to be responsible. I want us to go back to school. We’ve passed a very robust package. I’m willing to do more. But ladies and gentlemen, this virus is going to pass. What kind of country are you going to have if liberal Democrats run the House, the Senate, and take over the White House? They’re going to do over the electoral college, where New York and California pick your president. They’re going to pack the Supreme Court with liberals. That’s what’s at stake in this election. Don’t be fooled.\nJudi (Moderator): (10:25)\nYour time has expired, sir. But let me ask you a quick follow-up because you say that the issue is about paying people more when they’re not working versus what they earn by going to their job. But Governor McMaster has said that protocols are being put in place at the Department of Employment and Workforce to make sure that benefits are terminated for anyone who refuses to turn to work. So a lot of people that we’ve heard from want to understand why you’re taking that position if we are putting protocols in to prevent your concern.\nLindsey Graham: (10:50)\nWell, it helps to have actually run a business. My family ran a restaurant, a bar, and a liquor store. And here’s what I can tell you, when you’re paying $23 an hour not to work, it’s pretty hard to get people to come back and they get mad when you ask them to come back to work for $18 an hour. I saw this coming. Joe Cunningham understands that what we’ve done is you’ve paid people more not to work than work. I’ve run a business. I know what it’s like to compete with your own government. The one thing I can tell you for small businesses in South Carolina, we’ve got to be generous to people who’ve been unemployed to no fault of their own, but you can’t pay them more not to work than the work. I’m for making you whole not giving you a pay raise and unemployment. And my liberal Democratic friends don’t understand that. I do. My family ran a business.\nJudi (Moderator): (11:35)\nThank you, sir. Our next question comes-\nJaime Harrison: (11:37)\nJudi, can-\nJudi (Moderator): (11:38)\nHe didn’t mention you directly, but if you’d like to respond on our next answer, we’ll come back to it in your response. I need to get to our panelists. My colleague Bill Sharpe, head anchor at WCSC in Charleston. Bill.\nBill Sharpe: (11:48)\nThank you, Judi. Gentlemen, good to have both of you with us here live across the state. Mr. Harrison, Senator Graham, good to see both of you again. Senator, your judiciary committee will hold hearings on Amy Coney Barrett, the present judge, Judge Barrett, the president’s nominee for the United States Supreme Court. And there’s a good chance that she will be a confirmed on the High Court, which would give the Supreme Court a definite tilt toward the conservative side. If she’s confirmed, and it seems as if she will be, that conservative tilt, there is talk, could do away with Roe versus Wade, the 1973 law, Mr. Harrison, which gave as you know, women the right to an abortion, and if not do away with it, overturn it completely, might chip away at a woman’s right to have an abortion. So Mr. Harrison, Senator Graham, my question for you is does a woman in this country have the right to control her own body even if she wants an abortion? Thank you gentlemen.\nJudi (Moderator): (12:54)\nMr. Harrison.\nJaime Harrison: (12:55)\nI believe she does. Men have rights to control their bodies and women should have equal rights to control their bodies as well. Listen, in the end of the day, this is an issue that is a hard issue, but I believe that it’s between a woman, her doctor, and her God. Politicians shouldn’t be anywhere in it. We need to make sure that abortions should be rare. We should look at how we expand adoptions, how we have contraception and educate our kids about all of that. But at the same time, it should be safe if it is the law of the land, which it is at this point in time.\nJaime Harrison: (13:32)\nBut what we need to do is look at healthcare and particularly healthcare for women. Here in South Carolina, we have some of the highest infant mortality rates in the country. I don’t know if you all know this, but two years ago here in South Carolina, 14 of our 46 counties had no, let me repeat that, zero OB/GYNs. Many of our hospitals in some of our rural communities are closing right now. What are we going to do to tackle these disparities in healthcare that women and particularly minority women are experiencing right now? Senator Graham has failed in his 25 years to properly address these issues.\nJudi (Moderator): (14:09)\nSenator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (14:10)\nWell, Amy Barrett is one of the most qualified people in the history of the nation to be nominated for the Supreme Court and she’s going to get on the Court. I’m the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I’ve tried to be fair when it comes to judges. When president Obama won, I recognized he won the election. I voted for Sotomayor and Kagan, knowing they would be liberal justices, but I understood they were qualified. And here’s what bothers me so much about this whole issue. My opponent supported the filibuster of Judge Gorsuch, one of the most qualified conservatives any Republican president could pick. And he cheered on the crowd that was trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh’s life. Amy Barrett’s going onto the Court. She will decide Roe v. Wade based on the merits. I am proudly pro-life. I’m sponsoring a bill that would eliminate abortion on-demand at 20 weeks. We’re one of seven nations in the entire world to allow a baby to be aborted at 20 weeks.\nLindsey Graham: (15:03)\n… nations in the entire world, that would allow a baby to be aborted at 20 weeks, the fifth month in pregnancy, and my opponent opposes that. This a radical Democratic Party we’re dealing with. Amy Barret, will be a buffer to liberalism, she will decide cases based on what the statute says, what the constitution says, and she won’t make things up. If you want conservative judges, I’m your only bet in this race.\nJudi (Moderator): (15:25)\nOur next panelist is Joe Bustos, from the State Newspaper, the state and government politics reporter there. Joe.\nJoe Bustos: (15:32)\nEven gentlemen. Senator Graham, you say you’re moving forward with Amy Coney Barrett is confirmation, because of how Democrats treated Justice Kavanaugh. Mr. Harrison, you said, “Filling the Supreme Court seat shouldn’t be rushed before the election.” Now that previous norms for confirming judicial appointments have been eliminated, what should the new rules be, for filling this Supreme Court seat?\nJudi (Moderator): (15:52)\nSenator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (15:53)\nI think the new rule should be, following the Constitution. When a vacancy is available, the sitting president can fill it, you get a four year term, not three and a half. 19 judges had been confirmed in an election year, where the president of one party was of the same party as the Senate. That’s nothing unusual. We’ll have a hearing beginning October the 12th, it will be done safely. And again, we can conduct the hearing safely, but no Democrat seems to say anything about a mob coming up into my yard or attacking Republicans, after president Obama accepts the nomination in Washington. It seems like a riot can’t spread the virus. Amy Barrett, will be treated respectfully, I hope. We’re following the norms of the Committee in terms of, opportunity to question her.\nLindsey Graham: (16:37)\nI want to compliment President Trump, for sending over this fine woman. I hope she’s not treated like Kavanaugh. Yes, she’s religious. Yes, she’s a devout Catholic. Yes, she has seven children. And all of that to me, doesn’t matter. What matters, will she apply the law to the facts, and I’m looking forward to it. And one of my legacies as a United States Senator is that, I’ve tried to be fair, not only to Democrats when they appoint judges, but I’ve been a leader on getting conservative judges on the Supreme Court, and the best is yet to come in Amy Barrett.\nJudi (Moderator): (17:09)\nThank you sir. Mr. Harrison.\nJaime Harrison: (17:11)\nSometimes listening to Senator Graham, it reminds me of playing monopoly with my son, you change the rules. He changes the rules every time he gets. Senator, you said, “Use my words against me,” and you said it after the Kavanaugh meetings, not before the Kavanaugh hearings, after the Kavanaugh hearings. And your words, your promise was, that no judicial nominee should be considered or approved or what have you, in the last year of an election, and you even named president Trump when you said it.\nJaime Harrison: (17:43)\nAnd so this is my thing. My grandfather always taught me, he said, “Jaime, a man is only as good as his word.” Well, Senator, how good is your word, when you made a promise to the American people, and even more, you made a promise to the folks in South Carolina, that you wouldn’t be doing what you’re doing right now. And that’s the problem that I have. I think the greatest errors that you could do as a public servant, is to betray the trust of the people that you took an oath to serve, and that’s what you have done. Now just be a man of it, and stand up and say, “You know what? I changed my mind. I’m going to do something else.” But don’t go back and blame it on somebody else for something… a flip-flop that you’re making yourself.\nLindsey Graham: (18:23)\nIf I may, I said in August, if an opening comes about, we’ll see what the market will bear. Ms. Barrett, is going to get confirmed because the president has the constitutional authority to do it. And here is what can say about judges, when president Obama was president, I honored the fact that he won the election, and I voted for two people I wouldn’t have chosen. And I’ve watched the Democratic party, try to destroy one conservative judge after another. Mr. Harrison, encouraged the filibuster of Judge Gorsuch, the first partisan filibuster in the United States Senate. He cheered on the destruction of Brett Kavanaugh.\nLindsey Graham: (18:57)\nAll I can say is that, Amy Barrett is highly qualified. I’m the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The president has every right to do this, and if you’re counting on Mr. Harrison to ever vote for a conservative judge, you’re making a mistake of high proportion. You can count on me for conservative judges.\nJudi (Moderator): (19:13)\nThank Sir. Thank you very much.\nJaime Harrison: (19:14)\nJudy.\nJudi (Moderator): (19:14)\nEric Weisfeld. Well, he did make direct… well he did actually [Crosstalk 00:19:19], 45 seconds sir. I want to get as many questions [inaudible 00:19:22], go ahead.\nJaime Harrison: (19:22)\nI understand. I understand.\nJaime Harrison: (19:23)\nListen, in the end of the day, this is not about Democrats versus Republicans, it’s about what’s right versus wrong. If you have established a precedence, if you have established a standard, then you should stick by it. Now, the one thing that we have not seen with Senator Graham right now and in the Senate Republicans who are in control, is this type of urgency to address the Corona virus, COVID. Right now, there is a bill sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk, in order to take up. This state is suffering. Our businesses are shuttering. People are dying, as you mentioned earlier, there are not enough tests. But the urgency is to push the Supreme Court Justice, even when they have two members of the Judiciary Committee, who have COVID. But they have not moved at all, on addressing COVID, which is the number one issue right now.\nJudi (Moderator): (20:07)\nThank you, sir. Now to our next panelist, Eric Weisfeld. Primary anchor at WMBF in Myrtle Beach. Eric.\nEric Weisfeld: (20:12)\nGentlemen. Good evening. I want to continue to talk about Corona virus. Tourism is the number one industry where I’m from, Myrtle Beach and the Grand Strand. And the truth is, we are coming off a very bleak summer season and going into what looks to be weak, fall, and winter seasons, as well. Bottom line is, COVID- 19 has paralyzed our community, restaurants, businesses, hotels have closed, some of them permanently. My question to you is, as Senator, what would you do to bring back our number one moneymaker?\nJudi (Moderator): (20:45)\nMr. Harrison.\nJaime Harrison: (20:46)\nOne, we can’t take a piecemeal approach. Take a look at countries like New Zealand. Right now New Zealand, is almost COVID free, and that is because the leader there along with the local leaders, took a direct approach to address this issue. Yes, there was a difficulty initially, but what they have now, you don’t see the spread of COVID. In addition to that, when we think about while we’re in the situation we’re in, because we had feckless leadership, so how do we make it better? How do we make sure that we address the issues that folks in Myrtle Beach are dealing with? Well, you don’t do it by blocking the unemployment relief, because there’s a dignity of work in this thing. It is not that people are sitting on their butts, eating bon bons, while they wait for the federal benefit to come into their doors.\nJaime Harrison: (21:31)\nWhen 750,000 of those folks lost their jobs Judy, 400,000 of them also lost their health insurance, because they had employer based health insurance. So now, not only do they have to take care of their kids who are at home, not only do they have to pay for their internet, to pay for their education, but they also have to dig deeper now, to figure out how they pay their rent and how to pay their health insurance. That’s why we need a Senator who is going to fight for us in our hard times, not fight against us.\nJudi (Moderator): (21:58)\nSenator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (21:59)\nI think it’d be good to have a Senator who’s family ran a restaurant, a bar, understands the service industry. I was in Myrtle Beach yesterday, I want to help people who have lost their job, no fault of their own, but the unemployment benefit packages is deterring people going back to the work. We’ll come up with a benefit package, it doesn’t pay you more not to work than to work, will make it whole, but not give you a pay raise. There’s a $2.2 trillion bill, coming out of the House of Representatives, that has $900 billion to bail out, all of the blue States. I want to help the States, but not bail them out for things unrelated to COVID.\nLindsey Graham: (22:35)\nWe need another round of PPP. 67,000 businesses received a PPP loan. Let’s do it again for businesses, 300 and under, who’ve lost 25% of their revenue. The people at Myrtle Beach are suffering, the best way to get back to work and back to a good life is to get a vaccine. President Trump, is doing warp speed, vaccines are coming forward at a lightening rate. The world has been affected by COVID, the drug therapies are working, the mortality rate is down. I’m encouraged, I’m optimistic. And the best way to get Myrtle Beach back up and running, is to have a president and his Senate, that won’t tax them into oblivion, and regulate them to death.\nJudi (Moderator): (23:15)\nThank you Sir. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Mike Cihla. He’s an anchor at WTOC in Savannah. Take a listen.\nMike Cihla: (23:21)\nPresident Trump signed an executive order, deferring payroll taxes for Americans earning less than $100,000 a year, until the end of this year. He says, he wants to make it permanent if reelected. Now the payroll tax pays for things like Medicare and Social Security. The Social Security chief actuary says, “That would mean Social Security, would be depleted if that went forth three years from now. These are called entitlement programs, which can give the perception that people feel they deserve these programs without doing much for it. But the truth is, the American people have paid into these programs with every pay check, over the course of their lifetime.” What would be your plan moving forward?\nJudi (Moderator): (24:00)\nSenator Graham, first to you.\nLindsey Graham: (24:01)\nWell, number one, let me tell you about me and Social Security. I’m the first in my family to go to college. Mr. Harrison has a great story. But neither one of my parents finished high school. My dad was a World War II veteran. We owned a liquor store and a bar, and you can’t afford to get sick. You go to work every day because if you don’t open up, you don’t get paid. My mom was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease, we were under insured and we got wiped out. 15 months later, my dad dies, if it wasn’t for Social Security Survivor Benefits, my sister Darlene who was 13, we wouldn’t have made it. We moved in with an aunt and uncle that worked in the Textile Mills, up in Oakland County, she got Pell Grants. We’re all one car wreck away from needing help. I’m a Republican, but I get that. I really do.\nLindsey Graham: (24:43)\nWhat would I do to save Social Security? Whatever it takes. I make $175,000 a year, as a Senator. I have a military retirement. I have a congressional retirement. I’ll take less than benefits, to make sure somebody like my aunt who worked in the textile plants, who can’t afford to get less… I think Cola, for upper income people like me, you shouldn’t get the same Cola, as somebody on a fixed income. We’ve got to work together. We got to save Social Security. And the way you save it, is if you can afford to take a little bit less, do it. I can now, when I was 21, I couldn’t. I would never ask anybody to give up any benefits they couldn’t afford.\nJudi (Moderator): (25:18)\nThank you very much Sir. Mr. Harrison.\nJaime Harrison: (25:20)\nWell, one way that you save Social Security, is not by eliminating the payroll tax right now, and during this time period, because as the actuary mentioned, it would wreck this program. And again, Social Security is important to me. I remember when my grandfather passed away in 2004, my grandparents were on an unlimited income, they didn’t have a pension, they didn’t have a 401k, all they had was their Social Security. I remember sitting there the Social Security Office with my grandma, because our thought was that she would get both her check, and my grandfather’s check. The woman said, “Ms. Harrison you’ll get a death benefit,” which was about $200, $300. And my grandma said, “Well, when will I start getting Willie’s check?” And the woman said, “You won’t. You’ll get the higher of the two.” And it was like, somebody punched my grandma in the gut because she was thinking, “Oh my God, how do I pay for all of these things?”\nJaime Harrison: (26:10)\nFolks deserve the money that they have put into the system. Lindsey Graham said, “That Social Security and Medicare, were promises that we can’t keep.” Senator, I’m sorry, but they are not promises. People have paid into these systems and they deserve to get the money back that they put into it, because that is the livelihood that they have.\nJudi (Moderator): (26:32)\nThank you, sir.\nLindsey Graham: (26:32)\nMy I.\nJudi (Moderator): (26:32)\nAbsolutely, Senator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (26:34)\nNumber one, you want a Senator who can fix a problem, you got to acknowledge, you got a problem before you can fix it.\nLindsey Graham: (26:39)\nIn 1950, there were 16 workers for every Social Security recipient, we’re down to three, in 20 years there’ll be two. My aunt’s on Social Security, most of my family worked in the Cotton Mills, and that’s all they’ve got. I’m of an income where I could take a little bit more and I would to save Social Security.\nLindsey Graham: (26:57)\nLadies and gentlemen, is going to take Bipartisanship. Ronald Reagan, working with Tip O’Neill’s, saved Social Security back in 1983. Something like Simpson [inaudible 00:00:27:05], I’m ready to work with Democrats to save Social Security and Medicare. I’m willing to pay more for my prescription drugs because I can, and there’s people out there that can’t. But I’m not going to turn America into a socialist nation, and that’s their agenda for your health care.\nJudi (Moderator): (27:21)\nOur next question is about campaign ads. This question comes from my colleague, Richard Rogers at WRDW in Augusta. Take a listen.\nRichard Rogers: (27:29)\nGood evening. I think it’s safe to say people have been hammered by negative ads in this race. First of all, why did you feel the need to go negative? And would you like to set the record straight on anything that might be a false claim in those ads.\nJudi (Moderator): (27:43)\nMr. Harrison, first to you.\nJaime Harrison: (27:45)\nWell, thank you for it. Well, listen, I haven’t gone negative, I’ve just been informing people and educating people about Senator Graham’s record. Now in terms of negative and not true, Senator Graham is running something right now that talks about me working for a company that foreclosed on folks in Katrina, and implies that I actually did that.\nJaime Harrison: (28:04)\nWell, first of all, when hurricane Katrina hit was 2005, I was working for Congressman Jim Clobber, and I worked for Mr. Clobber until the end of 2008. In 2006, I led the delegation, I put together a delegation of members of Congress to actually go down to New Orleans and to Mississippi, in order to work to rebuild those areas, because the Bush administration had failed to properly help the rebuilding effort. And that was part of the agenda that Jim Clobber and others had, in order to get the majority back, in 2006 election.\nJaime Harrison: (28:35)\nAnd then, as someone who personally has been homeless for a while, I took personal offense to this idea. Now, as Senator Graham wants to talk about foreclosures, we can talk about how he voted for the guy who’s called the King of foreclosures, and that’s treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who foreclosed on 17,000 homes, over the course of a five-year period.\nJudi (Moderator): (28:56)\nSenator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (28:56)\nYeah. Richard, your question was about ads and money. Let’s talk about money in politics, where the hell is all this money coming from? What is it about South Carolina’s has attracted, almost a hundred million dollars into a Jaime Harrison, Mr. Harrison’s coffers. They hate me. This is not about Mr. Harrison, this is about liberals hating my guts because I stood up for Kavanough, when they tried to destroy his life, this is about me helping Donald Trump. The only good Republican as waned it tries to undercut Trump.\nLindsey Graham: (29:29)\nI lost a president Trump, when I ran for president, if you don’t remember me running for president, it’s not your fault, it didn’t last that long. I accepted the fact that he won. I think he’s done a good job as president. He’s rebuilt the military. He’s cut our taxes. He’s getting trade deals and he’s securing the border. So the bottom line, the reason you’re seeing all these ads, is they’re trying to take me out. They want the house. They want the Senate. They want Pelosi, Schumer and Biden. They want Harrison in the Senate. They’re going to change the Electoral College. They’re going to do away with private healthcare, Medicare for all, take your health care away from you. They’re going to be…\nLindsey Graham: (30:03)\nMedicare for all, take your healthcare away from you. They’re going to decriminalize coming into the country. They’re going to give illegal immigrants free healthcare. That’s what they say. They mean it. This is election is about taking me out.\nJudi (Moderator): (30:13)\nThank you, sir.\nLindsey Graham: (30:14)\n-Because I’m standing in their way.\nJudi (Moderator): (30:15)\nMy colleague, Adam mentor has our next question. Our political reporter from WYS Adam.\nSpeaker 2: (30:19)\nThank you. Both. Many of the protests in South Carolina had been ignited by calls for law enforcement to confront systematic racism and policies and procedures. Do you believe there is systematic racism within law enforcement? And what do you believe is the best way to address that?\nJudi (Moderator): (30:35)\nSenator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (30:35)\nI know, I do not believe that our re… Our police are systematically racist. I do believe in police reform my best mate, Senator Scott had a proposal to reform policing, more transparency, more people of color, more people from minority communities in the police force.\nLindsey Graham: (30:51)\nIt was blocked by my democratic colleagues because they want the issue, not a solution. So here’s what I think the cops need our support now more than ever. I’ve never known it this difficult to be a police officer yesterday, the paternal order of police in South Carolina endorsed my candidacy because it’s chairman of the judiciary committee.\nLindsey Graham: (31:10)\nI’ve had the cops back reformed the cops yesterday, fund him. No, he was asked mr. Harrison twice. “Would you define the place?” He dodged it now he’s for not defunding the place cause I made him. Most South Carolinians want police reform, but we respect the cops. Cops are under siege. They’re being assassinated. I will never ever defund the police. If you need more money for social programs, I’ll work with you. But cutting the cops budget puts poor people at risk more than anything else, and Tim Scott is tried his best to find a solution. And unfortunately my democratic colleagues stopped him because they want the issue not to solve the problem.\nJudi (Moderator): (31:51)\nMr. Harrison.\nJaime Harrison: (31:51)\nYeah, let me be clear on this because again, Senator Graham sometimes exaggerates. I have said clearly, and I’m going to say it clearly here. I do not believe in defunding the police. Why do I not believe in doing that? Well, Sarah Graham, my grandpa, my grandpa, Ron, served in police force for over 30 years.\nJaime Harrison: (32:10)\nHe served in homicides, risking his life in day in and day out. And so I understand that there are good police out there that they’re working in order to protect and serve. But at the same time, we also understand that there’s some bad apples because there’s an entire community that is fearful when sometimes a blue light comes behind them because they don’t know whether or not their lives are going.\nJaime Harrison: (32:32)\nThey’re going to have their lives after the interaction. And so we have to admit that there are some problems in some of our policing right now. And we have to work with our police and the community members to bring folks together in order to do that, not to divide them, not to, not to scare them, but to work on addressing this problem. Now, Sarah, one question that I have for you, and you said that you’re not forward the funding and police in president Trump’s budget, this budget, it cuts community policing by almost $500 million. Do you support that Senator grant?\nLindsey Graham: (33:05)\nNo. I’ve been a really good supportive community policing. And I would say that Senator Scott above all others understands this issue in the Senate. He’s African-American Republican. He goes through great grief. He tried to fix the problem, but Mr. Harrison’s campaign, this a hundred million dollars is coming from the most liberal people in the country. Move on.org.\nLindsey Graham: (33:28)\nTheir main agenda item is to defund the police planned Parenthood who supports this campaign, wants the police to apologize to African-American communities. What I want to do is make policing better for African-American communities of all the people in the nation that need good cops is poor people in minority neighborhoods. So I’m with the cops. If you got any doubt about where I’m going to be, I’m going to be with the cops.\nJudi (Moderator): (33:53)\nOur next question, we didn’t… He didn’t- mention it regularly.\nJaime Harrison: (33:56)\nHe did, you can ask him, he did.\nJudi (Moderator): (33:59)\nGo ahead quickly, 45 seconds.\nJaime Harrison: (34:01)\nWe’ll listen. You know, Senator Graham is talking. He loves talking about all of this money and all, when he was raising a ton of money, he, it was okay, but anytime anybody else’s raising money, that’s problematic. Well, Senator, let me just say this Senator Scott is not the only black person who understands the interactions with police. I’ve had my interactions as well, and I’ve always tried my best to follow the law because that’s what my grandma taught me, dude.\nJaime Harrison: (34:24)\nThat’s what my grandpa taught me to do. And so there are problems right now. There are families who have lost loved ones as a result of it. And so all I am saying is we should have had, you should have had you were a chairman of the judiciary committee I hearing on the bill, but you didn’t even have that Senator.\nJudi (Moderator): (34:42)\nSenator Graham [crosstalk 00:34:43] the next question?\nLindsey Graham: (34:44)\nI’d like and say is that Senator Scott has got a proposal that he tried to take the floor of the Senate. I had a hearing that lasted all day. I do care the first step that this is an effort to get African-American males and Hispanic males out of jail that were sentenced alone. Jail terms for nonviolent offenses. I was one of the leading sponsors of that working with Senator Berker from New Jersey, Tim Scott’s done everything I know anybody could do to try to found common ground. His efforts were filibustered is sad. It’s a shame, but this whole issue about the cops law and orders on the ballot. I just talked to the cops yesterday. They feel abandoned. They feel like people don’t care anymore. If you’re a police officer out there, I’ll always have your back.\nJudi (Moderator): (35:27)\nThank you both. Let’s move on now to our next question. It comes from Alonzo Julian, the 96th student government association president here at Allen university. Alonzo.\nAlonzo Julian: (35:36)\nHello. I just would like to say Senator Graham and Mr. Harrison, thank you so much for attending Avenue University.\nAlonzo Julian: (35:41)\nWe welcome you here. My question is Ellen University recently signed an MOU with Savannah nuclear river solutions that will strengthen relationships and opportunities for minority students with the company. If elected, what is your to champion Qualified minority, homegrown talent emerging from institutions other than large state support at schools?\nJudi (Moderator): (36:05)\nThis question first to you first Mr. Harrison.\nJaime Harrison: (36:07)\nWell thank you for doing that and thank you so much for your leadership. It was so great to meet you. You know, a few weeks ago, I announced my rule hope agenda. It is an agenda to rebuild and revitalize rural communities here in South Carolina, bring hope back to these communities that have just lost all sense of hope.\nJaime Harrison: (36:24)\nIt’s a five-part plan that talks about healthcare, education, infrastructure, economic opportunities, and an includes a farmer’s bill of rights. Part of my education initiative talks about a partnership specifically with historically black colleges and universities that focuses on creating a new stream of revenue for those Universities, but focuses on having those universities partner with rural communities and to provide them with technical assistance to make sure that they are incubators for new businesses, particularly for communities where young folks have not… Young folks in minorities have not been represented. And so we have an agenda robust one to make sure that we rebuild the schools and that there’s a pipeline of young talent, particularly from our HBC use that have been left out historically, but giving them opportunities so that the rest of the country can see them shine.\nJudi (Moderator): (37:20)\nSenator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (37:20)\nSo HBC use are a blessing to our state. A lot of students who go to the historical black colleges and universities, sort of the first in their family to ever go to college, I can relate that the goal is to make sure our best and brightest don’t lead the state. Nobody has been more supportive of Santa river… Savannah Riverside than I have is a crown jewel of one of our employers in the state.\nLindsey Graham: (37:42)\nI’ve done job fairs for HBCU graduates, with the military, with the FBI, with Boeing, with Michelin, to make sure that that talent doesn’t leave our state. The bottom line here is these schools have been a blessing. This program you’re talking about is very exciting. South Carolina state has an engineering program.\nLindsey Graham: (38:02)\nThey have one of the best asphalt management programs in the entire country. My sister has a master’s degree from South Carolina state. Go Bulldogs. So count me. And I’m so glad that president Trump made HBC U funding permanent, not temporary. And I can tell everybody in South Carolina, these schools are a blessing and what I want to do as a senator, what I’ve done in the past, make sure that the graduates of these universities don’t have to leave our state the best and the brightest stay here. And I’m fully committed to that. God bless you.\nJudi (Moderator): (38:33)\nThank you very much. The next question is one that I’ve received from a number of your constituents and our viewers. And I promised them, I would ask it tonight, Senator Graham, the question goes to you first. They want to know if you support term limits and what would be an appropriate one for a Senator and a representative?\nLindsey Graham: (38:50)\nWell, I’ll leave that up to the voters. You can limit my term November the third if you’d like. We have a history in South Carolina and strong Thermo is around for a while. So it was Fritz Ali, Jim clever. And I think I’m on the top of my game, but it’s up to you to decide. I think my voice is the strongest it’s ever been. I’ve been to Iraq and Afghanistan, 56, 57 times to make sure the war stays over there and never comes back here. I’ve got the military members back. I think I know more about national security than most people in the Senate.\nLindsey Graham: (39:20)\nWe got the strong department of defense footprint in this state understand the needs of our bases. And I want them to grow, not to shrink. I understand what the military needs in terms of modern weapons. I want them to come here. So quite frankly, I think I’m in a good position to help our state. And it’s up to you to see if you want me. I will always be conservative, but I’ll reach across the aisle to fix a broken immigration system, but I’m not for illegal immigrants getting free healthcare and open borders. It will ruin our country. Bottom line here is I’ve been leading the charge for 250 conservative judges when it comes to Lindsey Graham, the best is yet to come.\nJudi (Moderator): (40:02)\nMr. Harrison.\nJaime Harrison: (40:03)\nI think the question was about term limits. I mentioned what my grandpa said, and I’m going to repeat that a man is only as good as his word. Now this is another example of Senator Graham going back on his word to the people here in South Carolina, because when the center was there in the congressmen and he ran for Congress, he said, and he ran on a pledge, have term limits. He said that he would turn limit himself. And if you don’t don’t believe me, Google it, Google Lindsey Graham and term limits.\nJaime Harrison: (40:33)\nHe said he would term limit himself. It is now you said 12 years, 13 years later. And Senator Graham is still running and listen. I do believe that the ultimate term limit is in the power of the people here in South Carolina. But I also believe it is incumbent upon us to keep our promises. And if we change our minds, just admit, I changed my mind. Don’t duck and Dodge. And this is a thing that I promise the folks of South Carolina. I will never, never, never lie to you. Now. You may not agree with everything I say all the time, but you will always know where I stand and I’m not going to go back on my word.\nJudi (Moderator): (41:13)\nOur next question from Bill Sharp.\nBill Sharpe: (41:15)\nThank you Judy, gentlemen, I think neither of you has to worry about health care coverage. Goodness knows Senator. You’ve got the Cadillac of healthcare coverage as a us Senator and Mr. Harrison, I suspect you don’t have to worry about healthcare coverage either, but thousands of people in South Carolina do. And guess what? They’re on the affordable care act called Obama care and they get pre-existing conditions covered. Senator Mr. Harrison, where the affordable care act. Now we have an opportunity in South Carolina to expand Medicaid as part of the affordable care act. But have we done it? No, no, no. We’re one of 14 States in the entire country that refuses to expand Medicaid. So Mr. Harrison, Senator Graham, my question to you is, is the affordable care act worth it? Do you want to do away with the affordable care act or do you want to keep it and expand Medicaid to help poor people in South Carolina? Thank you gentlemen.\nJudi (Moderator): (42:22)\nThis is posed to you Mr.Harrison\nJaime Harrison: (42:23)\nWell, thank you for this question. And this is yet another personal one. You know, my grandfather who worked all of his life ended up 50 hours a week. Working the construction on a road here in South Carolina, never had healthcare until we found out he had undiagnosed diabetes and then eventually had to lose his leg and some toes. And eventually he died because of complications for diabetes.\nJaime Harrison: (42:47)\nThere are so many people in South Carolina right now, suffering in silence and I actually a correction South Carolina is now one of 12 States that still have refused to expand Medicaid and they haven’t done it because we can’t pay for it. The government, the federal government was going to pay for the first five years of this thing, a hundred percent. And then the state had to pick up 10% after that.\nJaime Harrison: (43:08)\nIt is because it was tied to a Barrack Obama. Let me tell you something. Part of the reason why we have had four rural hospitals to close in South Carolina over a few years. And if you live in one of those communities and you have diabetes or complications with your pregnancy and all, and now it takes you instead of 10 minutes to go to the hospital, 50 minutes to go to a hospital that is a death sentence. We need a Senator who understands, put politics aside and put the people first. Senator Graham has a horrible bill. Graham Cassidy, that the ARP condemned.\nJudi (Moderator): (43:42)\nThank you, sir. Your time is up. Senator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (43:42)\nHear the word health care and you hear a Democrat talk about it. They want to put all healthcare under government control. They want eliminate your ability to have keep healthcare at the work site. About 60% of the people below 65, get the healthcare at work of Obamacare as a placeholder for Bernie care. They’re believing in socialized medicine. Obamacare, Ms. Sharp was a disaster per South Carolina.\nLindsey Graham: (44:10)\nIt started with five choices. We’re down to one. Premiums have gone up 30%. You’re getting less coverage. Your co-payments are going up and your premiums are going up if you’re working so somebody else can get it free.\nLindsey Graham: (44:24)\nThree States under Obamacare get 35% of all the money, California, New York and Maryland that Graham Cassidy bill would block grant send that money back to South Carolina with a formula that would allow us to get 60% more than Obamacare would give us because we stopped sending money to New York, California, and Maryland. And here’s my belief of healthcare. Let’s get it out of Washington. Put it in the hands of doctors, close to you. Put it in the control of politicians. You can vote for, have accountability to ballot box. This bureaucrat run healthcare is a disaster for you- socialized medicine.\nJudi (Moderator): (44:59)\nThank you, sir, your time has expired. Our next question is from Joe Bustos\nLindsey Graham: (45:02)\n… a disaster for America.\nSpeaker 3: (45:02)\nI’m sorry, our time has expired. Our next question is from Joe Bustos.\nJoe Bustos: (45:04)\nYou both have said you agree that humans have contributed to climate change and you both oppose the Green New Deal. Why do you oppose it, and what concrete policies should the US pursue to curb global warming while not leading to job losses?\nSpeaker 3: (45:16)\nSenator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (45:17)\nI oppose the Green New Deal, because it’s crazy. You’re trying to eliminate all carbon fuels by 2035. It’s multiple trillions of dollars. You’re going to do away with cars. You’re going to do away with cows in the name of saving the environment. You’re going to destroy the economy. Climate change is real. I do believe in private sector solutions. I believe in the government working with the private sector. We’ve lowered our carbon emissions. I believe more electric cars are coming. But my solution to the environment is not to destroy the economy. My solution to the healthcare is not take it away from you at work and give it free to illegal immigrant.\nLindsey Graham: (45:50)\nThis agenda coming out of the House, and they’ll change the rules of the Senate if they get in charge, is going to be a disaster for us. You’re going to crush our economy, because the Green New Deal and Medicare for all are hundreds of trillions of dollars of new spending that we can’t afford. So this is a reshaping of America that I think is incredibly dangerous. Climate change is real. We’re on the path to lower emissions, but I will never ever destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment. It’s a problem, but not a religion. And I can tell you that AOC, who endorsed my opponent last week, has a plan for our nation you can’t afford and will destroy our economy and not save our environment.\nSpeaker 3: (46:32)\nMr. Harrison.\nJaime Harrison: (46:33)\nThe greatest gift that the Lord gave us is this planet, and the legacy that we have for our kids is the planet that we hand over to them in the next generation. Now, Senator Graham has mentioned that he believes climate change is real. Well, that ain’t good enough, if we don’t do something affirmatively in order to address the issue of the climate. I agree with the senator. I think the Green New Deal is too expensive. It’s become too partisan. We’ve got to figure a way, though, because we have to dramatically reduce carbon emissions. That is something that all of the scientists have said.\nJaime Harrison: (47:05)\nWe are seeing bigger storms. We know a big storm. We’ve seen Hurricane Hugo. We’ve seen these storms that have hit other places. We also know that the greatest threat to cities like Charleston and Hilton Head is the sea level rise. What are we going to do about it? Well, we can’t do the South Carolina offshore drilling, which Senator Graham proposed, which is to allow drilling off of the coast of South Carolina, again, threatening our economy and threatening the environment. We have to be affirmative in terms of focusing on this issue, because again, it is the legacy that we pass on to our kids.\nSpeaker 3: (47:43)\nThank you very much. Our next question from Eric Weisfeld.\nEric Weisfeld: (47:45)\nLet’s talk about I-73. It is an idea that would bring a direct link to the Grand Strand. Many are convinced the businesses, the industry it would bring would transform our area, but the problem is, at this point, it’s just that; it’s an idea. It’s been coined the road to nowhere. Senator Graham, Mr. Harrison, as senator, first of all, do you support… do you understand the significance of I-73, and if so, what would you do to finally give it the green light?\nSpeaker 3: (48:15)\nMr. Harrison, you first.\nJaime Harrison: (48:16)\nWell, listen, I support I-73. I support infrastructure here in South Carolina. One of the things, I have friends who sometimes come to South Carolina because it’s a beautiful place with beautiful people. And they say, “Jamie, I love South Carolina. The food is amazing. I love going to Myrtle Beach. I love going to Charleston. But, dude, what is wrong with your roads?” And that is a problem, my friends. Our infrastructure in this state, and I’m going to use a technical word, sucks. And it’s because we’ve had leaders who’ve been feckless for 20-some-odd years, and Senator Graham is one of them.\nJaime Harrison: (48:50)\nIn listening to debates over the years, every debate, Senator Graham gets this question about I-73, and every time he says, “Oh, I’m for it.” Well, you know what? There’s something that the kids in my classroom used to tell me. They said, “Mr. Harrison, the most powerful way that you can do and persuade somebody is to show and not tell.” People are tired of hearing politicians, time after time after time, say that they’re going to do something, and actually go to Washington DC, and all of a sudden they get some type of amnesia. I think Senator Graham is suffering from that amnesia. He has said that he’s going to be for I-73, and we still have not seen I-73 happen yet.\nSpeaker 3: (49:28)\nSenator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (49:29)\nWell, let’s talk about what I-73 is. It’s going to be an interstate highway that comes off 95, goes to the Grand Strand. It’d be great for Dillon and Marlboro County. I have secured funding from the Department of Transportation, through the South Carolina Department of Transportation to do the environmental impact study. People in [inaudible 00:49:47] County have increased taxes to widen 22. This thing’s going to happen, but me and infrastructure, who was it that came to the port, say, when we’re going to lose the Port of Charleston? I, working with the delegation, made sure that the Port of Charleston had the funding it needed to get to 52 feet, to be the premier port on the East Coast.\nLindsey Graham: (50:07)\nWhen our back was against the wall, I went to Harry Reed to get $150,000 to do a study so that we wouldn’t miss a year. I’ll put my record up against anybody working for the people of South Carolina. Got $35 million from the Federal Department of Transportation to get the Panthers headquarters located in York County, out of Charlotte. Great jobs. I-73, working with Tom Rice, we’re going to get there. So, billion dollar project, stay tuned. I’m for an infrastructure bill of multiple trillions. Roads, bridges. But when it comes to infrastructure, Senator Graham has been there and will be there for you.\nSpeaker 3: (50:44)\nOur next panelist, Adam [Mencer 00:05:45],\nAdam Mencer: (50:46)\nThank you. Both of you have been attacked as being extensions of your party’s leaderships. You’ve both said you will represent the people of South Carolina. What national issues, if any, will you dissent with your party when taking votes?\nSpeaker 3: (50:58)\nSenator Graham, first you.\nLindsey Graham: (50:59)\nHow long do you have? Lindsey Graham [inaudible 00:51:03] my name on talk radio. I’ve worked with Democrats for over a decade to get a comprehensive immigration solution, to give the 11 million here illegally a chance to stay on our terms, learn our language, pay a fine, get in the back of the line. Secure our border. Increase legal immigration so people don’t have to cheat. I’ve been the climate change solutions caucus with Democrats and Republicans. I voted for Sotomayer and Kagan and got the crap beat out of me here at home by Republicans. I thought that’s the way we’re supposed to do it.\nLindsey Graham: (51:35)\nI want to solve problems. I want to save social security. When it’s talking about working with the other side, it’s not just talk with me, and I’ve got the political scars to prove it, but I want you to understand that your grandparent’s Democratic Party is no longer around. The people running the Democratic Party today are nuts. They want to give illegal immigrants free healthcare and have open borders. That’s not solving our immigration problem. They want socialized medicine. Medicare for all means Medicare for nobody. They want to take your healthcare away at the work site. They want to do it electoral college. They want to expand the Supreme Court beyond nine justices to pack it with liberals. There’s a lot at stake here.\nSpeaker 3: (52:17)\nThank you, sir. Thank you. Mr. Harrison.\nJaime Harrison: (52:18)\nThe first step in terms of working with the other side is not to call the other side nuts. This is the thing, Senator Graham. I have a six-year-old who I often teach in terms of how to conduct himself. And I said, “You know, son, that sometimes people come from different backgrounds and they see the world a little differently, but that doesn’t make them bad because of it.” Even though Democrats and Republicans may take the different paths, hopefully our destination is the same. How can we make South Carolina a better place for all of us? Not just Democrats or Republicans, or progressives versus conservatives, or liberals and whatever other term you want to come up with. We’re South Carolinians first. We’re Americans first. How are we going to work together? When I was the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, my best friend in politics was the Republican chair, Matt Moore. Matt and I, I think there was even a story written about how we were the odd couple, because we worked together. We respected each other. That’s the foundation for how you get things done. You’ve been in Washington for 25 years. Yes, you listed climate change and immigration. Those are issues that still have not been addressed. You’ve only passed three bills, three laws that you sponsored originally in 25 years. We can do better, but we’ve got to change the leadership to do so.\nSpeaker 3: (53:35)\nThank you, sir. Our question now from Alonzo… we’re running tight on time, Senator, so let me get this last question in… Alonzo Julian.\nAlonzo Julian: (53:42)\nYes. As the coronavirus pandemic has exposed, educational equity has room for improvement in our state. What are your plans to bridge the gaps and create equitable education opportunities for minority K through 12 students and students living in rural areas throughout the state, to further ensure that college is a viable option for them, should they choose to pursue it?\nSpeaker 3: (54:08)\nMr. Harrison.\nJaime Harrison: (54:09)\nCollege has to be affordable and accessible. Listen, one of the jobs that I had was running a nonprofit called College Summit that worked to help low-income kids get an opportunity to go to college, to live the American dream. I’m a Testament that that works. That is powerful. Education is the gateway to the American dream, and we need to make sure that we can do everything possible in order to do that. First of all, we are seeing and witnessing something that we have never witnessed here in America before. Young people have $1.6 trillion of debt. There is more student loan debt in this country than there is credit card debt, and that’s the first time that it has ever happened.\nJaime Harrison: (54:48)\nWhen you’re a young person and you are saddled with 200 and $250,000 of debt to start off life, no other generation had that type of burden, but this generation does. I’m still paying off… 20 years after graduating from college, my wife and I are still paying off our student loan debt. That’s a burden for so many young folks. And so I want to work to make sure that we reduce tuition costs for our kids so that they don’t have to be saddled and that we work on the student loan debt crisis here so they don’t have to be burdened with such debt to start off their lives.\nSpeaker 3: (55:19)\nSenator Graham.\nLindsey Graham: (55:20)\nWell, number one, Mr. Harrison, pay off your student loans so somebody else can go to school. You’re a multimillionaire. You worked for Pelosi for three years and Congressman Clyburn, and then you went to work for the Podesta Group. I’ve given you 11 years of my tax returns. You’ve given seven years. The last year you made almost a half a million dollars. How much money did you make as a lobbyist? Why are you still paying on your student loans? Why can’t you pay them off? You’re a multimillionaire. You cashed in on politics.\nLindsey Graham: (55:47)\nLet me talk a little bit about broadband for rural South Carolina. If you’re in a poor area, in a rural area, we need to have high speed internet so your schools can get the best and brightest minds of our time. You want to help rural South Carolina? Pass my bill with Senator Warner from Virginia. That’s a $10 billion grant to wire up rural South Carolina, rural America, with high speed internet.\nLindsey Graham: (56:09)\nBut a little bit about tone here. He’s running an ad accusing me of darkening him. He’s calling me a racist. That’s the worst thing that’s ever been said about me in politics. All I can tell you is that’s not who we are, Mr. Harrison. An African American male can be a senator. Just ask Tim Scott. You’ve just got to have the right ideas. A daughter of immigrants from India can be our governor, just ask Nikki Haley. This is a wonderful state and we can do better than this, Mr. Harrison.\nSpeaker 3: (56:39)\nYour time is up. Thank you, sir. Mr. Harrison, to respond.\nJaime Harrison: (56:39)\nYes. What you saw there folks is Lindsey’s taken all these talking points and trying to dump it all to you. Let me just say this, Senator, you are worried about everybody else’s paycheck other than your own. When you said, “Over our dead bodies will we allow an extension of the unemployment benefits for folks who are desperate right now just to make ends meet,” what about the fact that you have raised your salary three times, Senator? I wish many of us could raise our salaries like that, but you raised yours three times. And you are worried more about my bills than I am. Senator, in addition to my household, I have two boys that I have to take care of, along with my wife, but I also have a grandmother who’s elderly, who I help pay bills. I also have a mom who was foreclosed on her home before, and I help her as well. And so I appreciate the thoughtfulness that you are so concerned about my student loans-\nSpeaker 3: (57:28)\nYour time’s up, sir.\nJaime Harrison: (57:29)\n… but Senator, let me tell you, I pay them on time.\nSpeaker 3: (57:31)\nThank you, sir. Thank you. Senator Graham, we have less than a minute left. I’ll give you 20 seconds to respond.\nLindsey Graham: (57:35)\n[crosstalk 00:57:35] thank you for the job I have. I make 175,000 plus as a senator. I never thought I’d make this much money. I pay my aunt’s house payment. I helped my niece with her student loans. That’s what we’re supposed to be doing.\nSpeaker 3: (57:48)\nSenator. I’m sorry. We’re out of time. That is our time for tonight-",

         "Bernie Sanders: (00:11)\nI have participated in many rallies in my life. This is clearly the most unusual. So, I want to thank everybody for being here for this limited audience event. It means a lot to me, and I know it means a lot to the Vice President. And let me begin by wishing the President and the First Lady a full and speedy recovery from the COVID-19 illness that they are now dealing with. And of course, we wish the same for my colleagues in the Congress, as well as the many, many millions of Americans who are struggling with this terrible disease.\nBernie Sanders: (01:03)\nWhat the last few days have told us is, if there was ever any doubts, it should now be clear that no one, no one, is safe from this pandemic. It doesn’t matter if you are a frontline worker in a hospital. And I want to take a moment to thank all of the doctors and the nurses and the medical personnel who have put their lives on the line to protect all of us. And it doesn’t matter if you are an essential worker in a supermarket, if you are a packing house worker, if you are a bus driver, and it doesn’t matter if you are the President of the United States. Each and every one of us is vulnerable, and we will remain vulnerable until there is a vaccine or a perfected cure. That is the reality, and there is no way to get away from that. There are some who say that we have to make a choice between having a strong economy and protecting the American people from this terrible disease. I disagree. The truth is, we will never have a strong economy so long as this pandemic continues to surge as it is today.\nBernie Sanders: (02:46)\nWe will never have a strong economy if people are afraid to go to work, afraid to go to school, afraid to shop, or afraid to have dinner at a restaurant, or afraid to do all of the things that we normally do. We will never have a strong economy unless we get this pandemic under control. Is the solution to this crisis to shut down the economy and lock everybody in their homes? No, it is not. We can keep our country moving forward if we do so in a way that is disciplined, not dangerous, that is responsible, not reckless.\nBernie Sanders: (03:47)\nNow, I want to ask you and the American people some very simple questions. Which candidate for President has shown that he will be disciplined, that he will be responsible in dealing with this pandemic? Which candidate for President has made it clear that he will develop policies based on the advice of the best scientists in our country and the world? Which candidate for President will develop national protocols and guidelines and model the behaviors we all need to engage in to keep our families, our neighbors, and ourselves safe? Which candidate has the temperament to see us through this difficult crisis?\nBernie Sanders: (04:53)\nLet me repeat that point. Which candidate has the temperament to see us through this difficult crisis? I don’t think there is any doubt that the answer to those questions is that in the worst public health crisis of the last 100 years, we need Joe Biden as our president. Now, let me say a word about the economy. Let me be blunt, tell you the way it is. And that is that the working class of this country is in more desperation today than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s. That is a fact. It is a sad fact, but that is the truth. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens have lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic. They have lost their incomes. They have lost their health insurance. They have depleted their life savings. They cannot afford to pay their rent or their mortgages.\nBernie Sanders: (06:27)\nAnd in too many cases, in the richest country on Earth, they cannot afford to put food on the table for their kids. Today, the percentage of Americans who lack employment is at the highest level in 45 years, while tens of millions of Americans who do have jobs are often working part-time for starvation wages. And as bad as the economy is in general, it is far worse for the African American and Latino communities. During this pandemic, nearly 60% of Latino families and 55% of African-American families have either experienced a job loss or a pay cut. How devastating is that? Meanwhile, and it is important to make this point because it is not made often enough, while the working class of this country is being devastated as a result of the pandemic, not everybody in America is hurting. The truth is that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, over the last six months, that situation has gotten-\nBernie Sanders: (08:03)\nLast six months, that situation has gotten even more grotesque. In the last number of months, 643 billionaires, that’s not a lot of people, have seen their wealth go up by $845 billion.\nSpeaker 1: (08:21)\n[inaudible 00:00:24].\nBernie Sanders: (08:24)\nAnd let me just say that again. While 30 million Americans have lost their jobs, while 12 million Americans have lost their health insurance, while 29 million Americans do not have enough food to eat, while 40 million of our people face eviction, 643 billionaires increased their wealth by $845 billion over the last six months alone. So, that is the state of the economy today. Simple truth is that the very, very rich are getting much, much richer while nearly everybody else is struggling or getting poorer. And let us be very clear, despite what you may have heard over the past four years, the economy has not been very good for the working class of this country.\nBernie Sanders: (09:35)\nAnd sometimes we lose track of that, but here is the truth, you don’t have over the last four years, and I’m not now just talking about the last six months, but you don’t have a strong economy when half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. Do you all know what living paycheck to paycheck is about? I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck. Joe Biden grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck. Many of you are living paycheck to paycheck.\nSpeaker 2: (10:11)\nIf we got one.\nBernie Sanders: (10:13)\nIf you got one. It was not a good economy for the last four years when 87 million Americans were uninsured or under-insured, couldn’t get to a doctor when they were sick, and unbelievably and horrifically when 68,000 Americans were dying each year, because they could not go to the doctor when they got sick. Can you imagine that? Richest country in the history of the world, 68,000 of our people die each year, because they can’t get to a doctor when they get sick, because they lack the money and don’t have any health insurance. It is not and has not been a good economy when over 40 million workers were earning starvation wages of less than $15 an hour. And here, again, is the simple truth, nobody in America can make it on eight, or nine, or $10 an hour.\nBernie Sanders: (11:28)\nAnd over the last four years, it has not been a good economy. When a half of older workers, and we don’t talk about this enough, when half of older workers had no retirement savings. Imagine being 55, 60, 65, you don’t got a nickel in the bank and now you’re on retirement. And how do you do that with any shred of dignity? It is not a good economy when over half a million Americans are homeless! Half a million of our people are homeless, including many veterans who put their lives on the line to defend us. And as part of that housing crisis that we are experiencing some 18 million families are spending half of their incomes on housing or more! How do you take care of your basic needs if you’re spending half of your income on housing. But I must tell you, over the last four years, it was again a great economy for the billionaire class and it has become even better for them during this horrific pandemic. My friends, we need an economy that works for all of us, not just the few. And it’s not just in recent years, it’s not just over the last four years. Here is something else that we don’t talk about. Over the last 45 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth in America, but sadly, that redistribution has gone in the wrong direction. From the working class, from the middle class, from the poor to the very richest people in this country. Since 1990, while the top 1% saw their wealth go up by $22 trillion, you got that? Top 1% saw their wealth increase by $22 trillion, the bottom half of America saw their wealth actually go down. Today, the average worker in America, and this is really quite astounding when you consider the growth of technology and the explosion in productivity, the average American worker today is now making $34 a week less than he or she did 47 years ago after adjusting for inflation. Can you imagine that? Over a 47-year period, an explosion in technology, increase in worker productivity, and yet the average American is earning less than he or she did 47 years ago.\nBernie Sanders: (14:41)\nWhat I understand, and I believe you understand, and the American people know is that we are all becoming more and more outraged with the corporate greed that we are seeing every single day. The American people are sick and tired of large, profitable corporations shutting down here in America and then moving to low wage countries all over the world. They are sick and tired of seeing CEOs now make 300 times more than their average employees. While they give themselves huge bonuses, they cut back on their health care benefits of their workers. The American people are sick and tired of that corporate greed.\nSpeaker 3: (15:45)\nYeah, they are.\nBernie Sanders: (15:45)\nThey are sick and tired all of us paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. While at the same time, the pharmaceutical industry makes 10.\nBernie Sanders: (16:03)\n… the same time, the pharmaceutical industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit, year after year after year.\nBernie Sanders: (16:14)\nIn my view, the American people understand that we can no longer sustain an economy which has more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the 1920s. When three people own more wealth than the bottom half of this country; three people; that is not acceptable. Under Joe Biden and under a Democratic Congress, we’re going to change all of that.\nBernie Sanders: (16:57)\nTogether, we are going to end a rigged tax code that allows billionaires to pay a lower tax rate, an effective tax rate, than nurses, teachers, and truck drivers. While at the same time, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth.\nBernie Sanders: (17:28)\nSo together, what this campaign is about, and what we must do in the future, is bring our people together by the millions to create a government and an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1%.\nBernie Sanders: (17:53)\nNow, it is no great secret that Joe Biden and I disagree on a number of issues. That’s a fact. But there is also no question that the economic proposals that Joe Biden is supporting are strong, and will go a long, long way to improving life for working families.\nBernie Sanders: (18:20)\nI want to take a minute to talk about those proposals. Because of everything that’s going on in this crazy world today, I think there has not been enough focus on Joe’s economic proposals. Again, they’re not mine, but they are strong proposals. And I want you and the American people to know what they are.\nBernie Sanders: (18:41)\nJoe Biden, you, and I know that it is not acceptable that tens of millions of Americans work at starvation wages. People cannot make it on nine, 10 bucks an hour. Joe knows that, you know that, I know that. That is why Joe Biden is going to help us raise that minimum wage to at least 15 bucks an hour.\nBernie Sanders: (19:15)\nWhat Joe understands is that if you work 40 hours a week, you should not be living in poverty. Joe Biden also understands that it is absurd that women make 75 cents on the dollar compared to men. If you’re a minority woman, that’s even lower. That is why Joe is going to make sure that we have equal pay for equal work.\nBernie Sanders: (19:52)\nJoe also knows that the path toward a stronger middle class is strengthening trade unions in America. Right now, all across this country, there are millions of workers who want to join unions. But because of the heavy-handed corporate tactics that now exist, it’s impossible for them to do that.\nBernie Sanders: (20:21)\nJoe and I and the United States Congress are going to go forward and make it easier for workers to join unions, engage in collective bargaining.\nBernie Sanders: (20:38)\nJoe also understands that we have got to stop providing corporate welfare to companies that are throwing American workers out on the street and moving abroad.\nBernie Sanders: (20:52)\nIt’s absolutely insane that we provide welfare to these guys. Then they say thank you and they shut down factories and plants in America.\nBernie Sanders: (21:02)\nThere’s something else that Joe understands. And that is that in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes, we need to create millions and millions of good-paying union jobs.\nBernie Sanders: (21:20)\nThe fastest way to do that is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure; our roads, our bridges, our wastewater plants, our water systems; and to build millions of units of affordable housing.\nBernie Sanders: (21:42)\nI’ll tell you what else Joe understands. He understands that we have got to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid medical and family leave.\nBernie Sanders: (22:04)\nWhen a woman in America gives birth, she should not be forced to go back to work after one or two weeks. When a child gets sick, Mom or Dad should be able to stay home, take care of that kid, and not lose a day’s pay.\nBernie Sanders: (22:25)\nI want everybody to hear it because it’s not been talked about enough. That is why Joe Biden has proposed at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for working families.\nBernie Sanders: (22:45)\nWhen we talk about babies and we talk about young children, we all know that our current childcare system is dysfunctional, and it is totally inadequate. Our children and their parents deserve high-quality, reliable, and affordable childcare. That is why Joe has proposed universal pre-K education for every three- and four-year-old child in this country.\nBernie Sanders: (23:26)\nWhen we talk about having the best educated workforce in the world, Joe understands that we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition free for the working class of this country. And that we must substantially reduce student debt in America.\nBernie Sanders: (23:57)\nAnd at a time of massive income wealth inequality, Joe Biden understands that we must-\nBernie Sanders: (24:03)\n… Equality, Joe Biden understands that we must demand that the wealthiest people and the most profitable corporations in our country start paying their fair share of taxes. No more tax breaks for billionaires while half a million Americans sleep out on the street. No more tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas or shift their profits to the Cayman Islands. Joe also understands that one out of five Americans who walk into their doctor’s office and gets a prescription, they cannot afford to fill that prescription because of the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in this country. And what Joe Biden knows and what I know is that if anybody is serious about healthcare reform, we have finally got to summon the guts to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry.\nBernie Sanders: (25:21)\nDuring my campaign for the presidency I took a trip from the Midwest, a few miles into Canada to buy insulin for diabetics. And we’ve got millions of people who were dealing with diabetes and the need for insulin. We went 15 minutes away from Detroit, Michigan into Ontario, Canada. We bought the same damn insulin as sold in the United States for 1/10th the price that was charged in America, 1/10th the price. That is an outrage. And together, Joe knows, I know, and you know that we have to take on the collusion, the price-fixing and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, so that Americans no longer pay the highest prices in the world for the medicine we need.\nBernie Sanders: (26:18)\nNow, as many of you also know, the United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human, right. Meanwhile, despite paying almost twice as much per person for healthcare as the people of other countries, over 90 million Americans today are uninsured or under-insured. And unbelievably, over a half a million people go bankrupt every single year because they cannot afford to pay their medical bills. While Joe and disagree on the best path to get to universal coverage, his proposal will greatly expand access to healthcare and make it more affordable for tens of millions of people across this country.\nBernie Sanders: (27:17)\nAnd here’s an important point that has not been talked about enough during this campaign. He is going to lower the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60, meaning millions of more people will be eligible for Medicare. He will expand Medicare to cover dental core, eye glasses and hearing AIDS. And he will substantially increase funding for community health centers to make sure that millions of Americans get the primary health care and the mental health care that they desperately need. Joe knows that when you talk about healthcare, you’re talking about mental healthcare as well. And by the way, if the Democrats gain control of the Senate, you’re looking at the chairman of the subcommittee on health. And trust me that the healthcare industry and the drug companies will understand a very new reality when that happens.\nBernie Sanders: (28:38)\nLet me conclude by once again, thanking all of you for coming out today and for saying that in the wealthiest country, in the history of the world and I want everybody to remember that, sometimes we forget it. We’re not a poor country. We are the wealthiest country, not only in the world, but in the history of the world. We need to create an economy that works for all of us. That works for our children. That works for our seniors. That works for the middle class, for the working class. We need to have a government and an economy that works for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors and the 1%. There is no excuse, none whatsoever, that in our country we have millions of workers today who are unemployed. We can put those workers back to work. There is no reason why over 90 million people lack health insurance or are under-insured. We can provide healthcare to all as a human right.\nBernie Sanders: (29:51)\nThere Is no reason why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major on Earth. And a dysfunctional childcare system. If we love our country, we love our children and it’s high time we had the best educational system in the entire world. Brothers and sisters, at this critical and unprecedented moment in American history, it is absolutely imperative that we stand together, black and white, Latino, Asian, American, Native American, gay, and straight. Those of us born in the United States, those of us who are immigrants. Let us stand together and elect Joe Biden as the next president of the United States. Thank you all very much.",

         "John: (00:00)\n-offs and thousands of others could lose their jobs soon. Race relations are at an all time low. These are the dark days that we have ever experienced. But, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, a chance to turn things around and get our country back where it belongs. It will happen one month from today on November 3rd when we have a chance to elect a man who has always been with us, a working class guy from Scranton, Pennsylvania, who will restore decency and honesty to the White House. It is my great honor to introduce the next President of the United States of America, my friend, Joe Biden.\nJoe Biden: (00:46)\nWell, John, you are my friend, Mr. President. I want to say good afternoon to everyone, and it’s great to see you all. I’m here today above all else to say thank you. Thank you, President Costa and the entire executive board for the chance to speak with you all today. And thank you for being one of the first juniors to endorse me last year. You stepped up for me and I won’t forget it. And I thank you for the bravery and commitment you show to your jobs and to the people you serve every single day. A lot of people don’t get it. You’re in the front lines of this pandemic. And as we’ve all seen too clearly this week, COVID-19 is still a threat to our health, as well as our economic security. We have to do so much more to step up to get this virus under control.\nJoe Biden: (01:32)\nWe need to take science, the science of fighting this disease seriously if we’re going to save lives. That means making sure essential workers, and you all are that and more, folks like you get to, and the people who are doing all of the work on the buses, subway system, keeping the country moving every single day, you have to make sure you get all the PPE you need. You need it for job safety, and for our safety, to be able to continue to transport people. We need a nation-wide mask guidance so that no one gets on a public transportation unit without a mask. When they turned that request down, the Department of Transportation, they made a gigantic mistake. It’s everyone’s pay … It’s not something that has taken away someone’s freedom. It’s a patriotic duty to wear a mask. You do it not just to protect yourself, but to protect one another.\nJoe Biden: (02:27)\nIt’s essential. You should be worried about the person next to you, in front of you, your husband, wife, mother, father, friend, neighbor. It’s essential. And it can save, as the experts have told us, up to a hundred thousand lives just between now and the end of the year, where it’s estimated by the University of Washington, as many as 200,000 more people will die from COVID unless we do something. 89 ATO members, as you’ve already … We just had a moment of silence, lost their lives to this virus. It’s heartbreaking. Think of the families that get up this morning and there’s an empty chair at the table. It’s unacceptable. We all know. I know what it’s like to have that kind of loss. It’s unacceptable. Even before this pandemic, we knew that your jobs were dangerous. You face harassments and threats of violence and so much more.\nJoe Biden: (03:19)\nSo, we need to put in place the protections and precautions to keep you safe in your work. You’re there every single day for the people who depend on you. You deserve leadership in government who will be there for you, will fight for you, prioritize your health, your safety, and in the process, prioritizing everybody’s health and safety. You’re the ones who fight for the right to organize and bargain collective. And I promise you, the National Labor Relations Act way back in the ’30s, everybody thinks that said, okay, now we can have unions. If you go back and read it, it said we should encourage unions, encourage unions. That’s what it was intended to do. My dad used to have an expression. He said the only way to fight the abuse of power is with power. Power. And the only power we have to fight back is unions, unions who understand that Wall Street didn’t build this country.\nJoe Biden: (04:16)\nMiddle class built this country, and unions built the middle class. That’s not hyperbole. That’s a fact. And I’ll be a president who sees you, respects you, and that’s my promise to you. I’ve been running on support for public transit my entire career. Our transportation workers were with me since my first Senate campaign back a hundred years ago in 1972 when I was a 29 year old kid, and I won by 3,200 votes in no small part because you guys came out for me. Enhancing and upgrading our public transportation structures is an essential part of my build back better plan to get us out of this recession. But I also know that people need help right now. You need help right now. With so many fewer people riding public transit right now, we need to make sure that state and local governments have the funding they need to keep you running.\nJoe Biden: (05:11)\nThanks to your leadership, the Cares Act secured $25 billion in emergency operating aid for transit. But I think we need to do more. We need to do more than just thank you. We need to pay you. Excuse me. This pandemic has taken the blinders off so many Americans. It’s shown us so clearly just how much we depend on you and all essential workers and how much we owe you. I’m not just saying that. That’s a fact. So, I’m going to say thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for all you do for this country. And I know there’s so much more to say, but I know you have questions for me, John. And I’d just like to say again, thank you, and I’m happy to take a few questions.\nJohn: (05:57)\nThank you, Vice President. Yes, we have two questions. The first question is, for transit workers, the current President’s failure to manage COVID-19 crisis has cost our members their lives. As mentioned, we have lost 89 ATU brothers and sisters to this horrible virus. A recent ATU survey found that 50% of employers have not provided bus operators with the basic personal protection equipment, PPE like masks and gloves. Without federal government help, transit agencies have been forced to bid against each other for PPE. And as a result, securing the lifesaving equipment has been difficult.\nJohn: (06:40)\nThe President has said that the federal government is not a shipping clerk. It’s every state and every transit agency for themselves. Defying all common sense, the first few critical weeks of this pandemic, Trump’s Department of Transportation remarkably said on its website that PPE is not recommended at this time. Even now after the CDC recommended wearing face covering in a public setting where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, the DLT has still not mandated masks on transit vehicles. So my question is, as a result, passengers with Coronavirus keep getting on the bus, infecting other passengers and transit workers, and there is no end in sight. So, how would you handle things differently?\nJoe Biden: (07:44)\nFundamentally differently. And I’m in a little bit of a spot here because I don’t want to be attacking the President and the First Lady now because they now have contracted Coronavirus, and Jill and I pray for their quick and full recovery, but our thoughts are with the families and the members you’ve lost as well. We have to bear the grief of an empty chair, an empty kitchen table chair, of not being able to turn and … I find myself when I lost folks in my family, you just tend to go. And you realize, no, it’s never coming back. This isn’t about politics. More than 200,000 Americans have died from COVID. 7.3 million have been infected. 30 million have lost paychecks, hours, or their jobs entirely. And throughout it all, you’ve kept the nation running. You’ve kept people connected.\nJoe Biden: (08:50)\nYou put others before yourselves, and whether they understand it or not, and I think average Americans do now, we can’t thank you enough. It’s always been essential, even if the rest of the country is just learning what an essential worker really is. Now look, here’s what else is essential. Getting you the support you need to do your job. It’s not enough just to praise you. We have to protect and pay you. We have to work as hard as you, as hard work as you do for your communities. And here’s what I’ll do as President. Number one, call on every single American to wear a mask when they’re around other people outside their households. That includes when they ride public transportation, buses, trains airplanes. Yesterday, the transportation department, stupidly in my view, rejected a petition to require just that, wear a mask when you’re on public transportation.\nJoe Biden: (09:43)\nIf I can say something here, this is not about freedom. It’s about patriotism. You wear a mask to protect the person next to you. You wear a mask to protect the bus driver. You wear a mask to protect the person you’re sitting next to on the bus. And to reject the chance to do the easiest thing possible to save lives, I find it appalling. I promise you my Department of Transportation will insist on it. Two, get protective gear to every worker on the front lines. It’s unconscionable that for so long Washington left our states, cities, and transit agencies to bid against one another. If that’s not the President’s responsibility, what the heck is his responsibility? Not my fault. I have no responsibility. Go to your mayor, your governor, your employer. It’s unconscionable that seven months in so many transit employees still aren’t provided enough PPE to keep you safe on the job.\nJoe Biden: (10:42)\nBy the way paranthetically, it’s not just you guys he doesn’t care about. They don’t care about much of anybody. They started off promising they were going to give school teachers and school children masks to go back to school. Then, famous said, “No, it’s not an essential requirement.” Not essential. As President I’d use the full power of the Defense Production Act to get PPE out to every single transit worker, hospital, job site, and school in this country, and I’d appoint a supply commander to make sure it’s distributed fast and fairly. It’s within our power to do this, John. We can do this. And the idea that they’re kicking it off to the, “No, talk to your governor, not my responsibility,” come on. I don’t know. If that’s not a responsibility of a President in the middle of a crisis, I don’t know what in God’s name a responsibility is.\nJoe Biden: (11:40)\nThirdly, we’ve got to fix the testing fiasco. Surging tens of millions of test kits where they’re needed most provide free testing and treatment and vaccine when it’s available for everyone, and make sure politics plays no role in vaccine approval. Period. I’ve actually told some governors, John, I probably shouldn’t say this, but you know me, told some governors, “Don’t endorse me. Don’t endorse me because you’ll pay a penalty. You won’t get what you need from the federal government in terms of his covert crap.” Not a joke. My word. Not a joke. We aren’t blue states and red states. We’re the United States. United States. If you elect me President, I’m going to be President for all Americans. I’m running as a Democrat proudly, but I’m going to make sure I’m President for the people who voted against me as much as those who voted for me.\nJoe Biden: (12:38)\nThis division of our country is just devastating. Thirdly, or fourthly, I’m going to enforce tougher safety standards and get schools and businesses clean safety guidelines and resources, implement them. Tell people to stay healthy when they ride with you. And I’m going to fight to get you the hazard pay you deserve. And by the way, it’s not just about getting you masks. We also have to protect you. Look at the people. Look what’s happened to your drivers. A guy getting off a bus and says goodbye, and he slits the driver’s throat and kills him. Look what’s happening. We got to get you the protective gear. Not only that, we’ve got to get you separation. We’ve got to get plastic and coverings around the drivers. You’ve got to make sure that you have separation. There’s so much we can do.\nJoe Biden: (13:28)\nAnd it doesn’t cost that much. It doesn’t cost that much. But even if it did, it’s an obligation we have. I really mean it. I find this one of the most despicable things that I’ve encountered in my whole career. When the administration was told that there’s a thousand people a day dying of COVID, the response was, “It is what it is.” It is what it is? It is what it is because they are who they are. That’s why it is what it is. We can change this. I promise you on day one, I will.\nJohn: (14:09)\nThank you, Mr. President, Vice President. You kind of touched on, Joe, my second question. And that is, what is your plan to save transportation services in this country? Transit systems are running out of money. School bus contractors and motor coach companies are going out of business. Right now, we are facing layoffs all across the country. And the safety situation on the bus right now is terrible. Our members, they serve as mass police.\nJoe Biden: (14:44)\nThat’s right.\nJohn: (14:45)\n[inaudible 00:14:45] regulations while trying to drive a bus at the same time. Even before the pandemic, our ATU brothers and sisters had been getting attacked behind the wheel.\nJoe Biden: (14:57)\nYep.\nJohn: (14:58)\nSlapped. They get punched, spit on, held up at gunpoint, and stabbed. So Joe, I know you had brought a little bit of this up. We’ve been fighting for safe buses and the industry to make changes, but what are your thoughts on these transport … What are your thoughts on these, and transportation funding on safety issues?\nJoe Biden: (15:23)\nWell first of all, we have to come together to beat the virus. Every path forward starts there. That’s how we get people back on the train, back on the buses, back on the school buses, back to go. They’re getting their lives back. And it’s how we keep our transit system solid. But along the way, one of the most urgent things we have to do is get emergency fundings out to states, cities, and transit authorities now. Now. Because of the ATU working with the House, you were able to work hard to see the 25 billion in aid that was included in the so-called Cares Act, those first pieces of relief legislation. But I know it’s not enough. Tens of thousands of transit workers have already been laid off. Tens of thousands. And I said for months, the Republican Senate needs to step up and pass another economic relief package right away so painful cuts don’t make this crisis worse.\nJoe Biden: (16:18)\nYou may remember, John, when we went through this with the single-most significant recession in American history short of a depression, when Barack and I came into office and we were inherited the Bush recession. I was asked to manage the Recovery Act, which was $80 billion. Excuse me, $800 billion. And the first thing I was able to do is get over $140 billion to the states and localities so they didn’t have to lay off transit workers. They didn’t have to lay off school teachers. Didn’t have to lay off firefighters. They didn’t have to lay off police officers, because all the cities and counties have to work on balanced budgets. That’s why the founders said we didn’t have to balance budgets nationally to be able to compensate when things got bad. Well, House passed the package twice. It’s time for Mitch McConnell to do his job and save millions more hardworking Americans that don’t lose theirs.\nJoe Biden: (17:15)\nBy the way, we said, “The states are going to go bankrupt.” He said, “Let them go bankrupt.” Well, we need better protection to keep you safe as well during this COVID crisis, as we discussed, but go far beyond. I’m never going to forget the bravery of Thomas Dunn, who was so viciously attacked while driving his route in Tampa last year. But somehow, still steered his passengers safely to roadside before he died. He warned about driver’s safety months before, but was left unprotected. As President, I promise you I’ll fight to get past the Transit Worker and Pedestrian Protection Act to get barriers installed to stop that kind of assault, to reduce blind spots, to make so many other things possible for you. It’s ridiculous. Like I said, I just had my license to drive a school bus when I was in law school. I can tell you what. It was hard just working out what the kids were doing behind me.\nJoe Biden: (18:16)\nI can’t fathom today. I can’t fathom today driving a bus or running a subway without having more protection. I promise you I’ll invest a record amount in infrastructure, dramatically increasing the funding for public transit to help power our recovery. That includes improving transit bus lines, helping cities and towns and small new light rail networks, investing funds in low-income communities. Somewhere between 60 and 70% of the American people who live in inner cities, their jobs are outside the city and they don’t have vehicles. They need transportation to get to their work, to improve their neighborhoods, to improve their schools. Look, this is a crisis, and we have a real opportunity to build back better. And you all, your dedication is going to get us there. But here’s the thing. Can I go on another minute, John, because I think this is pretty important?\nJohn: (19:16)\nYes.\nJoe Biden: (19:16)\nLook. What people don’t get, you guys get it, is if we invest significantly in transit, I want to invest about three quarters of a trillion dollars in transit overall, because it does two things. One, it gets people off the highways. And if you know if you have long distance transit, if you can get there as fast in a train or on a rail as you can in a vehicle, people leave their cars and get in the rail. That will save billions of gallons of oil over time and deal with pollution. Light rail in cities. I’m going to say something. One of your executive vice-presidents from Detroit, one of the things I was able to do in addition to getting our 200 buses in Detroit, we put in a light rail system. Why? Because an awful lot of those people there worked in the hospitals outside of town. And then in town, they could get back and forth to work.\nJoe Biden: (20:21)\nIt saved the city, and has significantly increased the capacity to do more in the city and outside the city. We’re in a position that if we invest in rail, light rail, if we invest in buses, and we’re going to change the way buses run, we’re going to have buses that run. We’re going to get electric buses down the road. We’re going to own the electric market in vehicles, both in buses as well as automobiles, creating well over a million new jobs. Not a joke. And by the way, the Wall Street guys looked at my numbers and what I was talking about and acknowledged my plan will create seven million more jobs than the President’s, and increase by $1 trillion economic growth, because we have to start using our brain. We can both deal with climate, employment, and health if we in fact move in a direction to focus heavily on transit.\nJoe Biden: (21:17)\nIf I can give you one little example, and I know the folks who are … That’s a slightly different operation, but Amtrak. In order to build, if we eliminated Amtrak on the Northeast Carter, we’d have to build eight new lanes of I-95 from Washington to New York. One mile of I-95, the cement and all that’s needed, is $20 million. $20 million. Imagine what would happen if we didn’t have rail, and imagine what would happen if we had high-speed rail. Imagine what would happen if all these towns and cities had light rail that could get people to and from work. It would save them money, save them opportunities, provide more opportunities for them. I know I’m going on too long, but this transportation is such an incredible part of our economic recovery. And by the way, we’ve got to make sure you start to get paid what you deserve. Paid what you deserve.\nJoe Biden: (22:30)\nBut first and foremost, I promise you I’m going to get you all the PPE that’s necessary. That’s a promise. Secondly, we’re going to make sure you are safe on your transportation system where you are operating it. And that means plexiglass. That means mirrors. That means a whole range of things we can change in order to deal with this. And because I tell you what, you’re the guys and women I grew up with. You’re the people who make it run. Like I said, I’ll end where I began. I view things from Scranton, not from Wall Street. I view things from the folks I was raised with. A trolley line ran by my house. It was a great equalizer for everybody. We’re in a situation where we can change things drastically for the better and help everyone across the board. The wealthy will do just fine when we do better.\nJoe Biden: (23:21)\nEverybody does fine. Everybody does fine. But most important, your personal safety is critical. And I really mean it. I give you my word. So thank you, John. Thank you for your help. And thank all of you. In case you see me looking to my left here, that’s where all of you are up on the screen. There’s about 500 of you on a screen up here. So hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. And I’m looking at … Where was a beautiful little baby being held by a dad a moment ago? Anyway, that’s awful punishment to make a kid have to watch me on television here on a Zoom, but thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nJohn: (23:58)\nMr. Vice President, you didn’t go on too long. Actually, it was great to hear someone that gets it and someone that actually felt like they know our job. I haven’t heard that in a long time.\nJoe Biden: (24:11)\nWe can do so much, John. We are in position. If we win this thing, we’re in a position to change the country. I really mean it. I really mean it. There’s gigantic hope out there. I’m confident. There’s so much we can do. And transportation is such a critical part of it all. The overall infrastructure, the overall economic recovery, making sure people … Anyway, I am going on too much, but I love you guys. Thank you.\nJohn: (24:39)\nThank you, and I just wanted to say some closing remarks. Vice President Biden, thank you for joining us today. Our members learned a lot about your views on the key issues that matter most to them. We hope you will stay safe and healthy and go on to win back this country. Brothers and sisters, thank you for joining us today for this special event. Early voting has already begun in many states. If you’re going out to the polls, be safe. If you are voting by mail, get your ballot in. Despite what you are hearing from the other side, voting by mail is totally fine. However you do it, just vote. Vote as if your job is on a line because it is. Vote as if your health is on a line because it is. Vote as if our way of life is on the line because it is. Get out and vote for this courageous, honest, and decent man who will lead our country back from the brink, Joe Biden.\nJoe Biden: (25:55)\nWe can do this, folks. I promise you.\nJohn: (25:57)\nThank you. Thank you, Joe. And have a good evening.\nJoe Biden: (26:01)\nPutting on my mask.\nJohn: (26:03)\nThank you everybody. Be safe. Brothers and sisters, I hope you enjoyed. Please vote. We need to change this.",

         "Dina Titus: (00:00)\n… here on the campus where I’ve taught for 35 years. Thank you UNLV. Welcome to all of you. Thank you for being here. I want us to start first by wishing the president and the first lady a full and speedy recovery. Our thoughts are with them, but they are also with all the patients and their families who are tying to deal with this virus through no fault of their own. Now is a good time to remind all of us to wear these masks, do social distancing, wash your hands as much as possible, and we’ll come out stronger on the other side if we are in this together. So thank you for doing that. And thank you to the Biden-Harris campaign for following those kinds of rules for the good not of themselves, but for all of us. So that’s why we’re doing this.\nDina Titus: (01:05)\nI love the campaign season. I love going out there, shaking hands, kissing babies, seeing friends around the district. So this is a new approach, this drive-in rally. But I guess it just gives new meaning to the notion of riding with Biden. That’s what we’re doing. Riding with Biden all the way to the White House. It’s been a very difficult time in this community. Whenever the economy is hit nationally, Las Vegas gets the worst of it. We’ve seen just recently that more hotels and the airlines are laying off people, small businesses are closing. I get about a hundred calls in my office every day of people who want help with unemployment, where to get rent and mortgage assistance, what about food banks. People are suffering right now. But those of us who’ve lived here for a while know that in Las Vegas, we’re tough, we’re Vegas strong, and we are resilient. We have proven it before and we’ll prove it again.\nDina Titus: (02:24)\nSo thank you for all of you who are on the front lines helping us get through this. We’ll come out stronger on the other side because we’re going to have new leaders who will help us build back better, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Just think how many lives and jobs could have been saved if we’d have had a comprehensive plan from the beginning and wouldn’t have had to go through all of this for such a long time. Fortunately here in Nevada, we had Governor Steve Sisolak, who listened to the science. He had to make some very hard decisions, but because of his leadership, we are getting through this. And now he’s taken time to be with us today because he knows how important this election is. Thank you, Governor Sisolak. Thank you, Steve.\nDina Titus: (03:32)\nThis election is not just about getting the virus under control or bringing back our jobs, it’s about giving our essential employees the pay that they deserve and the protection that they need to be on the front lines for us. It’s about ensuring that the symbol of the United States is the Statue of Liberty and not some broken down wall that’s going to not keep people out anyway. This election is about honoring the people who we lost on October the 1st by taking action against gun violence, not just with empty thoughts and prayers. And this election is about confronting climate change because we just don’t have enough time to put this off and pretend like it doesn’t exist. And this election is about addressing systemic racism, not giving marching orders to white supremacist groups.\nDina Titus: (04:39)\nThat is what is at stake. I was one of the first members to endorse Joe Biden back when no votes had been cast and there were enough Democratic candidates, they couldn’t even get all on one stage. But I made that decision because of who Joe Biden is. I know Joe Biden and Joe Biden knows us. He has the depth of knowledge, the breadth of experience, and the strength of conviction to bring this country back together. He has a plan to address the virus and restore our economy. He knows what it’s like to suffer a personal hardship, and has the empathy for those of us who go through it too. And he agrees with me that being progressive means making progress and getting things done. And that’s what I see in him. And I think he is the man for the hour. And thank you for supporting him for president.\nDina Titus: (05:45)\nBut he can’t get there without your help. We’ve all got to pitch in. You keep hearing the most important election of your lifetime. Well, this time it really, really, really is the most important election. So we’ve got to all get out. However you want to vote, vote early, vote by mail, drop off your ballot, go on Election Day. However you want to do it, make a plan and go and vote. And take your neighbors, take your family, take your Sunday school teacher, take your hairdresser. Drag anybody you can to the polls because casting that vote is so important. And you can start right now by texting Joe, easy to spell, J-O-E, text Joe to 30330. Get out those cell phones and text Joe to 30330. That’s how we’re going to make a change and that’s how we’re going to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\nDina Titus: (06:52)\nAnd speaking of Kamala Harris, we have a very special, wonderful guest with us here in Nevada today. I want you to help me welcome her. Give her a warm, warm welcome, because she is exactly the kind of dynamic, exciting partner that Joe Biden needs to get this done, both in the election and in the government. She has never hesitated to take on powerful people or powerful interest. She is wicked smart, deeply compassionate, and has proven to be a force in the Senate. She comes from California and has a affectionately said we’re close by so Nevada’s like her first cousin. Doesn’t get any better than that. She’s already making history. She’s going to be an outstanding vice president. She is a friend of ours. She is a great partner to Joe Biden. Give her a warm welcome, Senator Kamala Harris.\nKamala Harris: (07:59)\nWhat’s up, Nevada? Oh, honk if you love Joe. Oh, it’s so good to be with you all. Congresswoman, thank you for that introduction and all you do. What a fighter we have in Congresswoman Titus. Thank you all. Thank you everybody. Oh wow. Okay. First of all, there are so many incredible leaders who are part of this afternoon and who have been a part of this campaign from the beginning. And we’re going to count on them to lead us through these next 32 days to victory, but I want to thank them. [Shelby Parks 00:00:09:08], our field organizer. The great Governor Steve Sisolak. I was just hanging out with him behind the stage. Of course, Congresswoman Titus for all that she does. She is just a fighter in Washington. Senators Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto. They were going to be here but they wanted to stay in D.C. because they’re fighting to bring home relief to Nevada. And they are waging a good fight. They are fighting to make sure we take care of working people in America.\nKamala Harris: (09:47)\nI want to thank UNLV for hosting us today, [Mariachi Tierra 00:00:09:51], [Jay Masino 00:09:53], everybody for the work that you do. All right, so here. Is this working? There we go. There is so much at stake in this election. There is so much at stake and we’ve got 32 days to get this done. And we’re going to get it done. And here’s the thing, this campaign, our campaign, as Joe says, is about fighting for the soul of our nation. And when we talk about, when Joe talks about fighting for the soul of our nation, it’s about fighting for working people. It’s about fighting for families. It’s about fighting for children. It’s about fighting for healthcare. It’s about fighting for good union jobs. It’s about fighting to preserve our climate and clean air and clean water. It’s about fighting for a pathway to citizenship for our brothers and sisters and renewing protections under DACA. There is so much on the line in this election and there is not a thing we can take for granted, not a thing we can take for granted.\nKamala Harris: (11:06)\nWe are here fighting for the soul of our nation, saying yes, we can get criminal justice reform and policing reform. Yes, we can do what is necessary to bring healthcare to everybody because we believe access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. These are the things that are on the line in this election, and we’ve got 32 days to get it done. And I don’t need to tell my cousins in Nevada about the change we see coming with the work we are doing. The change we see coming when we know here in Nevada, we have the highest unemployment of any state in the country. When there has been incredible devastation because of a failure of an administration to take seriously a public health crisis and then do what is necessary to support working people. But we see the change coming, but we know it will not come without our investment in this fight. We have a vision of the future.\nKamala Harris: (12:23)\nOur campaign and the work, the hard work, the sacrifice we will make over the next 32 days is born out of knowing what is possible. And that is so much bigger than fighting against something. It’s about the fight we’re in for something, for the people, all the people. That’s what our fight is about. And the thing about it, and this is what I love about Joe. You can talk about how you measure strength. Some people say, “Well, look at my muscles.” Yeah, that might be one way. But the thing that I love about Joe, he could also say, “Yeah, look at my muscles,” but the thing about Joe is that he understands the greatest strength that any of us, that any human being has is displayed when we lift up the condition of other people. That’s the strength of who we are. The strength of who we are. And therefore the power of the people is knowing then when we are together, when we are joined, when we are unified, when we don’t allow people to try and divide us and turn on each other, we are strong. We are strong.\nKamala Harris: (13:51)\nAnd so in spite of all we’ve been experiencing, folks, don’t let anybody make you feel alone. Don’t let any circumstance make you feel isolated because we are all in this together. We are all in this together. But to achieve the change we can see coming, we got to vote. We got to vote. And so what do we want to do? Honk if you’re going to vote early. Honk if you’re going to vote by mail. Honk if you’re going to make sure at least five people you know are going to vote. 10 people you know. And here’s the thing, none of us are immune. We’ve been reading it. We know what’s going on around the country. There’s some powerful people in our country that are trying to make it difficult for folks to vote. Did you guys see what happened in Texas yesterday? The governor of Texas, the Republican governor of Texas basically started getting rid of the drop boxes in Texas. Yeah. That’s what they’re doing.\nKamala Harris: (15:20)\nSo here’s the thing, the right to vote, the right to vote was a hard fought and a hard won right. In fact, one of the biggest events that I attended before the pandemic struck was to walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama with now the great ancestor, John Lewis, who shed his blood on that bridge for the right for folks to vote. We honor the ancestors when we vote. Just last month, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, when those suffragettes, those powerful women marched and fought for the right for women in America to vote. We also recognize that it wasn’t until 1965 that black women could vote. So we know there is still work to do in that we are a country of work in progress. But this is the history of our right to vote. Our right to vote was a hard fought and won right which we will never let anybody take from us.\nKamala Harris: (16:34)\nBut we know there are obstacles around the country being put in our way. We know there are powerful people trying to suggest that you can’t trust the process, trying to suggest it’s rigged or it’s this or it’s that, but we know better. We know better. And here’s the thing I want to also point out. At some point, in addition to voting, it’s got to be about honoring the ancestors. And in addition to voting, it has to be about knowing what’s at stake. And also we got to just sit back sometimes and ask, why are so many powerful people trying to mess with our right to vote? Just sit back and ask that for a minute. Why are so many powerful people going through such difficulty to try and mess with our right to vote? And here’s what I believe the answer is. Because they know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, things get better.\nKamala Harris: (17:41)\nAnd so Nevada, never let anybody take your power. We will not let anybody take our power. We will use our power. We will vote. We know our vote is our voice. We know what is at stake. And we know we are all in this together in this fight for the soul of our nation. And it is a fight born out of love of our country, knowing what can be unburdened by what has been. Thank you, Nevada. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: (18:15)\n(singing)\nSteve Sisolak: (18:15)\nBring this home. Let’s hear everybody.\nSpeaker 4: (18:15)\n(singing)",

         "Speaker 1: (01:16)\nEveryone please welcome our first speaker and essential worker at a grocery store and a UFCW local 876 member, Matt Hoffman.\nMatt Hoffman: (01:36)\nThank you, Mr. Vice President for the opportunity to speak about what essential grocery workers, including countless UFCW members like myself are dealing with. My name is Matt Hoffman and I’m a grocery store worker in Imlay City, Michigan, and I have been on the front lines of the pandemics since day one. Working around the clock to help make sure families in my community have the food they need during this crisis. I live in a small town and our community has been devastated by COVID-19 and the damage it has done to our economy. Over these many months, there is not a day that goes by where workers like me are not putting our lives on the line. In the beginning, we had no protective equipment and we were even told we would be sent home without pay if we wore masks or gloves on the job. The health risks we face are real. We interact with the public every day. We are vital to the food supply, but we cannot do our job if we are not protected. Essential workers like us deserve essential precautions like hazard pay.\nMatt Hoffman: (02:49)\nI am here today because we need to build a better America than one we see. We need to create good jobs. We need to make sure employers do the right and pay us for the risks we face. We can’t afford to listen to companies that make billions in profit and then cut hazard pay. We need a leader who puts hardworking men and women and their families first. This is why I’m supporting Joe Biden. Lastly, I would like to urge all my friends and family, regardless of their party to vote for Vice President Biden so we can have a president who prioritizes us in our jobs. From everything I’ve heard you say and the way you clearly care for others, I know you are the leader we need. Thank you again for listening to Michigan workers and welcome Mr. Vice President.\nJoe Biden: (03:43)\nHey folks. Good afternoon. Before I start, let me explain the delay. We wanted to make sure that we’re doing everything by the numbers. And so I got two COVID tests this morning, one in Delaware, and one by the former White House doc who came up and everything’s cleared. We want to make sure everything was clear before I came. We were supposed to have an event after this at a headquarters, but based on the crowd size and an indoor, it was concluded by the docs that best not to do it. But I want to thank all of you. I want to thank Matt. And Matt, you’re dead right. You were putting yourself on the line and a lot of other people did all across this country in your union. And I want to thank David way, Secretary-Treasurer of local 951, for having me here today.\nJoe Biden: (04:51)\nLook, I’d like to start by acknowledging which I sure all of you do as well. Sending my prayers for the health and safety of the first lady and president of the United States after they tested positive for COVID-19. My wife, Jill and I pray that they’ll make a quick and full recovery. This is not a matter of politics. It’s a bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It’s not going away automatically. We have to do our part to be responsible. It means following the science, listening to the experts, washing our hands, social distancing. It means wearing a mask in public and means encouraging others to do so as well. It means having masking mandates nationwide. The director of the CDC, Center for Disease Control, Dr. Red field said, and I quote, and he held up a mask. He said, “These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have.”\nJoe Biden: (05:56)\nThen he held the mask up again and said, “This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than a vaccine.” Leading scientist from the University of Washington tell us that we can save more than 100,000 American lives in the next 100 days alone if everyone wore a mask in public. So let me repeat that because it’s so important. We can save 100,000 lives in the next 100 days, according to the head of the CDC, if everyone wears a mask in public. So be patriotic. It’s not about being a tough guy. It’s about doing your part. Wearing a mask is not only going to protect you, but it also protects those around you. Your mom, your dad, your brother, your sister, husband, wife, neighbor, coworker. Don’t just do it for yourself, do it for the people you love, the people you work with. The seriousness of this virus also underscores that we need regular testing with results turned around rapidly and that’s available to everyone.\nJoe Biden: (07:08)\nIt’s not just the folks in the White House or who travel with me that deserved regular testing, it’s folks in the meatpacking and food processing plants, grocery store workers. Every single American deserves safety and peace of mind. And it means we need transparency. Those who test positive need to participate in contact tracing so that everyone who they may have exposed can get tested themselves. That’s how you stop transmission for any epidemic. Is basic. We need to take the science of fighting this disease seriously if we’re going to save lives. And above all the news is a reminder that we, as a nation, need to do better in dealing with this pandemic. Taking these steps is how we’ll protect ourselves. And just as important is how we will protect one another. Hope that all those who are fighting this virus, including the first family and so many Americans today recover and recover soon. My prayers are with the families of the more than 200. I think it’s seven now. 207,000 Americans who’ve died from this virus.\nJoe Biden: (08:29)\nMany haven’t got up this morning. The breakfast table with an the empty chair of someone they lost and they loved. We understand. And there’s more than 7 million Americans who are have been infected. That includes folks here in Grand Rapids and all across Michigan, especially all of you or that you have with UFCW who are on the front lines of this pandemic and on the front lines of this economic crisis. UFCW workers who have always been on the front lines of fighting for dignity and respect you deserve. I know it’s been tough. This morning, September jobs report came out. The last one before election day. I’m grateful for all those who were able to get their jobs back to work again, but it was fewer jobs than we had hoped for. Millions of families, millions are still wondering when it will be their turn to come back from the brink. And the signs according to national press are not encouraging. Once again, the pace of job gains is slowing down. Once again, we’re seeing temporary layoffs turn permanent.\nJoe Biden: (09:44)\nThis month marked the largest single month increase in long-term unemployment since we started keeping records in 1948. There are now an additional 781,000 Americans who have been trying to find work for at least six months. They’ve been looking for work for at least six months and haven’t found it. And in the past, that’s a sign for permanency for them. We’re still down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started. All told, we are now 30 million workers who have either lost hours, lost paychecks or lost their jobs entirely. Participating in labor force participation fell last month and remains sharply down since this crisis began, especially for women. There’s another roughly 700,000 people who have dropped out of the labor force. Stopped looking for a job. The vast majority were women demonstrating once again how this economic crisis has been especially tough on women and families in This country. This will be the first presidency in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when it came into office.\nJoe Biden: (11:06)\nMichigan has lost more than then 361,000 jobs since the beginning of 2017. In fact, factories were already closing before COVID like the Knoll plant here in Grand Rapids. They announced back in January, they were shutting down and cutting 210 local jobs. Manufacturing has already slipped into recession last year. The net loss of auto manufacturing jobs you saw here in Michigan. And that economic pain was only amplified by the pandemic. Your schools and local businesses are closed like all places around America. More than 26 million unemployment claims were filed by Americans last month. 46 million Americans have exhausted their emergency savings and essential workers here in Grand Rapids won’t forget how the UFCW members saw their jobs turned suddenly into a life and death task. Folks, today’s report reinforces another painful trend. A continuing of what economists call a K-shaped recovery. And K means that letter going up. That’s those who on the top, it keeps going up while everyone else in the middle is going down and below. We’re seeing things get worse.\nJoe Biden: (12:43)\nIt means essential workers, UFCW workers who sacrificed to keep us going through the pandemic and continuing are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a fact, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just the top 100 of them. They’ve made up more than $30 billion this year in the last nine months. And everyone else, though you keep hoping, you get the bottom of that K-shaped recovery. You get the downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay the bills and put food on the table. How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids because their school has gotten remote. You’re asked to risk your neck because you can’t work from home when the risks for COVID are kept outside because you work at a meat packing plant or an assembly line or the checkout counter. I do understand this is a scary time, an uncertain time.\nJoe Biden: (14:01)\nI understand it and I see you because I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. A lot like Grand Rapids. It’s filled with an awful lot of good people busting their neck every day, do the right thing for their families. In Scranton my mom used to have an expression. She said not just in Scranton, but from the time we left there. She said, “Joey, nobody’s better than you Joey, but everybody’s your equal.” My dad’s constant refrain after he lost a job in Scranton when there were no more work and he had to move to Delaware. He moved away for a little over a year and come back every weekend to see us. The time we finally, a couple years down the road in Delaware, got to finally be able to buy a home. My dad used to use this expression. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” These are the values that shaped my growing up and I suspect most you.\nJoe Biden: (15:03)\nIt shaped my whole life. So I know and understood from the very beginning of consciousness about this, that Wall Street and CEOs didn’t build this country, the middle-class built this country and unions built the middle class. That’s why I’ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to make bold investments so we can build back and bill back better. And independent analysis actually from Wall Street, Moody’s, projected that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs. 7 million more than the administration’s economic plan and $1 trillion more in economics growth than the president’s plan. That’s not coming from a liberal think tank, that’s coming from Moody’s. Here’s how my plan works. I’m going to raise taxes on people only making over 400. Anyone making less than $400,000 a year won’t pay a penny more. But I’m going to ask the very big corporations, the Fortune 500 and the wealthy to pay their fair share for a change. That means raising the corporate tax rate, which was in the mid 30s and now is 21% back to 28%.\nJoe Biden: (16:24)\nThat means making sure that no big company gets away with paying zero taxes as 91 Fortune 500 companies do today making billions of dollars. Zero taxes. How many of you pay zero taxes? Means making sure the wealthiest Americans don’t get to pay at a lower tax rate because they’re making money on their investments, but they pay at the same rate that they pay for their salary. These changes in the tax code will raise the money, it’ll allow me to invest in working people and growing the middle class. Which is when I announced I was running, I said, that’s the reason. To rebuild the backbone of this country. Hardworking folks in the middle class, we’re going to invest in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs. By the way, my plan has been thoroughly analyzed by a whole bunch of folks. Take infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports will put millions of people to work in good paying union jobs and create the foundation for growth in this country.\nJoe Biden: (17:33)\nClean energy. Just upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes will create at least 1 million good paying jobs. Leading in the world on electric vehicles and building 500,000 electric charging stations on our highways will create 1 million new auto jobs here in this state. The manufacturing and technology in those areas, making sure the future is made in America, made in Michigan with good union jobs. The federal government spends $600 billion a year of your tax dollars. 600 billion a year to purchase everything from military equipment to steel, to cars, to trucks, to federal fleets at $600 billion. When I’m president, we’re going to make sure we finally make good on a commitment made a long time ago that these products, all these contracts, that the president of United States and the federal government can award, make sure those products are made by Americans in America. Making sure that, that’s done.\nJoe Biden: (18:53)\nIt’s estimated that we’ll create 5 million new manufacturing jobs and technology jobs. For small businesses, we’re going to make sure small businesses come out on the other side of this terrible circumstance with access to capital and the ability to deal with the debts that have been accumulated during this pandemic. And we’ll make investments to increase incomes as well. $15 minimum wage. No one should be in a position to have to work two jobs just to get above the poverty line. We’re going to bring back jobs from overseas to America and direct billions of dollars in revitalization funds and competitive grants to help communities like those in Western Michigan compete for new business startups. For our essential workers, we’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to pay you a good wage to ensure you have a strong benefits.\nJoe Biden: (19:54)\nWe’re going to ease the burden of the major cost in your life. Healthcare. We’ll build on the Affordable Care Act through a new health insurance option, a not-for-profit public option which will give private insurers a real competitor. We’ll increase subsidies for your premiums so they’re lower. So you can afford the plans with lower deductions and lower out-of-pocket expenses. That plan alone will cost over $700 billion over 10 years, but it’s paid for by eliminating those tax cuts. For a 40 year old making $50,000 a year, your monthly premium will go down by a third. We’ll take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs for up to 60%. Medicare will be able to negotiate prices for drugs fundamentally lowering those prices. And childcare. A lot of you’re dealing with that now. How do you go to work if you have work and take care of your kids or an aging relative that’s in trouble?\nJoe Biden: (21:05)\nWe’re going to make high quality childcare affordable and accessible. Every three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. We’re going to make sure that low and middle-income families will never have to pay more than 7% of their income for caring for a young child. In education beyond high school. We’re going to make sure that four year college tuition of a state university is tuition free for any family making less than $125,000. Community college would be free and programs and training will be free as well. If you buying your first home, you’ll have a $15,000 help to get there. These are all things that people have been talking about for a while. We’re going to protect social security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors.\nJoe Biden: (22:00)\nThe president’s talking about eliminating the withholding tax. Well, that’s wonderful except for one thing, the actuary of social security said if that plan goes through social security will be bankrupt by 2023. Folks, I promise you, we can do this. Let me close by saying this. I know a lot of people around here are tired of feeling overlooked and disrespected. I get that. The people I met this week taking a train through Northeastern, Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. People like the dedicated elementary school teacher from Lordstown, Ohio, whose husband, when Lordstown shut down accepted a transfer to Kentucky eight hours away each direction in order to be able to keep his healthcare and his pension after the GM plant closed. Folks who worry about healthcare. Will the Affordable Care Act still be there for them? Why? Why they ask. Will I be among the 100 million Americans who could lose the protections for pre-existing conditions like asthma and diabetes?\nJoe Biden: (23:15)\nWhere once again, women will be able to charge a higher premium just simply because they’re a woman. Where insurers no longer have to allow you to be able to keep your kids on a healthcare plan until age 26. What will happen to your Medicare benefits, your social security? Will they still be there when you retire? I’m asked many times in recent years, how do we get to the place where people who stock our shelves, pack our food, teach our kids like my family, take care of my wife, take care of our sick, who race into burning buildings and pick up the garbage off our streets. Who did. How do we get to the place where you all don’t think we see you anymore or hear them and most importantly, respect them? That has to change. I know it can. I come from those neighborhoods. We can get this pandemic under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. But this cannot be a partisan moment, it must be an American moment.\nJoe Biden: (24:27)\nWe have to come together as a nation. I’m running as a Democrat, but I will run and govern as an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you. And those who see each other as fellow Americans who just don’t live in red states or blue states, but who live in and love the United States of America. That’s who we are. And there’s never been a single solitary thing America’s been unable to do. Think of this. Not once. Not a single thing we’ve not been able to overcome when we’ve done it together. So let’s get the heck up. Remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. I want to say, God bless you and God protect the first family and every family who’s dealing with this virus and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

         "Sean Hannity: (00:00)\nLet me ask you, we have a lot of ground to cover and very little time to do it, there’s an election in 33 days. I went through a lot of things, and I don’t know. We always say the words, this is the land of the free and the home of the brave, and Mark is right.\nSean Hannity: (00:19)\nIf you look at the debate with Paul Ryan years ago, Joe Biden interrupted a lot, fought a lot, but from all my interviews with you, you don’t apologize for fighting to take out the Caliphate or Soleimani or al-Baghdadi or the Al Qaeda leader in Yemen.\nSean Hannity: (00:37)\nYou don’t seem to mind to fight to get the money for the wall or fight for lower taxes or to go out and fight for energy independence, or fight for the justices you promised you’d put on the Supreme Court. Some people say, “Well, maybe the president shouldn’t have fought so hard in the debate.” How do you respond to them?\nDonald Trump: (01:03)\nIf you look at what he did, he was probably, or possibly losing that coherence that everybody talks about, because he’s a mess. Let’s face it. He’s a mess. Now I could have waited, but he was saying so many lies that I figured it was just better to bring it up as he’s saying them, because it was just lie after lie, after lie.\nDonald Trump: (01:22)\nAnd so I’d do it as he said it, I would criticize him. And I think it was effective. If you look at the polls, I mean, almost all the polls, the poll people, the polls say that I won. The Hispanics, they had me close to 70% at 28 because they’re strong people, smart people.\nSean Hannity: (01:39)\nThat was the Telemundo poll. There was a WGM poll that had you at 61%. But by the way, I want to just-\nDonald Trump: (01:47)\nI mean, I would have preferred letting him catch himself because he can’t issue a full statement practically, but at the same time, on the assumption that he does, he’s going on and on with lie after lie, so I had to correct those lies as they came up. Too many to go back and get. We didn’t have enough paper. Too many to go and get. And I don’t know. I think it was very effective. Frankly, I’d like to leave the same format. I like the format.\nSean Hannity: (02:14)\nWhat if they change, talking about the debate commission, talking about changing the rules. There are already rules agreed to. What is your reaction if they try to do that?\nDonald Trump: (02:25)\nWell, this is the rules that were agreed to, but I think it would be very bad. Do you remember with Hillary Clinton, they had modulated my mic, and they actually apologized for it, but they modulated my mic. So when I looked at her, they had my mic turned off or way down, and I said, “What’s going on over here?” They actually issued an apology. So we’re dealing with very tricky people here, but I think you remember that very well.\nDonald Trump: (02:49)\nThey modulated my mic and they say I won all of the debates. So I was in 16, 17 debates. They say I won all of the debates. I like this format, but at the same time, he’s got got to be truthful. And by the way, a number of people brought up today, Sean, that he was the one that interrupted me. He started off with three major interruptions long before I started doing it to him.\nSean Hannity: (03:13)\nBy the way, I want to point out tonight, I know the first lady, Melania Trump, the White House is pink tonight in honor of breast cancer awareness month, and she wrote that, “As one nation, we remember the precious lives lost. Pray to bring comfort and strength to those battling the disease.” By the way, my mom in life had very advanced stage breast cancer, double mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation. She survived it, but barely. So it is an important thing. One in seven women can get this. It’s very scary.\nSean Hannity: (03:51)\nLet me ask you about Joe Biden will not answer the question about packing the Court. Chuck Schumer said last night that everything is on the table. That means statehood for D.C., statehood for Puerto Rico, ending the legislative filibuster, and some Democrats have even talked about moving for a constitutional amendment to end the electoral college. Joe Biden says that it’s a trick, a Donald Trump trick, to tell the American people if he’ll stack the courts or do any of these things. Your response?\nDonald Trump: (04:26)\nWell, I went after him on that and I said, “Are you going to stack the Court?” I also said, “Are you going to say the words law and order?” He wouldn’t say them. He then said, “Law and order with safety and justice,” or something. But I said to him that, but we need law and order in our country. And the Democrats cities are falling to pieces with these people running them.\nDonald Trump: (04:45)\nBut stacking the courts. They can have many justices. They want to put many because we’ve been beating them, and we have the nine justices and we have a great new one going on. But now what they want to do is they want to put many additional justices on the Supreme Court. It’s sort of like you’re losing the game and you start cheating.\nDonald Trump: (05:07)\nThey are. I mean, they’re doing it with the ballots, they’re doing it with the Supreme Court, and it’s a very sad thing. But they are, they are looking to stack the court. And they are also going to add two or three new states. I heard Guam and two others that you mentioned, as you know. That would give them six automatic Senate seats, automatic, no chance. It would be very unfair. And 20 something congressional seats. So that’s what they want to do.\nDonald Trump: (05:39)\nSo if you give them what they want, we really have a one-party system. We can never catch up. So they’ll be talking about anywhere from four to six senators. Republicans can’t win those states, although I’ve been better to Puerto Rico than any other president. I’ve given them a lot of help. But if you take a look at what’s happening, they’re not good to Puerto Rico, but I’ve been good to Puerto Rico. I have a great relationship to Puerto Rico.\nDonald Trump: (06:04)\nBut they’re looking for statehood. A lot of Puerto Ricans don’t want statehood. They’re doing better the way it has now, frankly. And you’ve been seeing this. This has been taking place. They want to put two or three states. So they want to have 53, right? 53. What’s the flag going to look like? Right, Sean? What’s the flag going to look like? They want to have 53 or 52? Depending on what they do, I guess they could probably do even more than that. We have islands all over the place. What don’t they go for the whole ball game?\nDonald Trump: (06:36)\nSo it’s a very, very sad thing for our country. Very, very sad thing. And in all fairness to Mitch, he did not want to do the nuclear option. And I disagreed because I said, “They’re going to do it.” It turned out that they are, but he’s a legitimate guy. He wasn’t going to do the nuclear option because he thought it was bad for our country. So I understood that. I didn’t go wild.\nDonald Trump: (06:56)\nBut I did say, “It would be good to do it because they’re going to do it.” So it’s a very sad thing. So you’re going to have two or three more states added. You’re going to have four or six senators added, 100% Democrat, 100%. You’re going to have maybe 20 congressional candidates or districts added. And it’s really a horrible thing. It’s going to be very unfair. You’re going to end up having a one-party system in the United States. So if people want to stop that you got to vote against the Democrats.\nSean Hannity: (07:29)\nBy the way, some news broke earlier this evening. Hope Hicks, who’s worked for you for a long time has tested positive for coronavirus. Obviously, our prayers are with her, and by the way, everybody that has, as you call, gotten this invisible enemy. Do you have any update on her and where are we with therapeutics? Where we with the vaccine?\nDonald Trump: (07:50)\nSo she did test positive. I just heard about this. She tested positive. She’s a hard worker, a lot of masks. So she wears masks a lot, but she tested positive, and I just went out with a test, because we spend a lot of time and the first lady just went out with a test also.\nDonald Trump: (08:07)\nSo whether we quarantine or whether we have it, I don’t know. It’s very hard when you’re with soldiers, when you’re with airman, you’re with the Marines and the police officers, I’m with them so much. And when they come over to you it’s very hard to say, “Stay back, stay back.” It’s a tough kind of a situation. It’s a terrible thing.\nDonald Trump: (08:27)\nSo I just went for a test and we’ll see what happens. I mean, who knows? But you know Hope very well. She’s fantastic and she’s done a great job. But it’s very, very hard when you are with people from the military or from law enforcement and they come over to you and they want to hug you and they want to kiss you because we really have done a good job for them. And you get close and things happen.\nDonald Trump: (08:51)\nI was surprised to hear with Hope, but she’s a very warm person with them, and she knows there’s a risk, but she’s young. And I just went out for a test. They just do it. It’ll come back later, I guess. And the first lady also, because we spend a lot of time with Hope and others. So we’ll see what happens, but you have to treat our people great. You can’t just say, “Stay away, stay away.”\nDonald Trump: (09:18)\nThey come up to you. They have such love with what we’ve done for them. And there’s such love and you have to treat our people great. I think the vaccines are coming quickly. I do think it’s somewhat political. They’d like to do it, even the drug companies, they’ve dealt with these people a long time.\nDonald Trump: (09:34)\nI think they’d like to do it after the election, even if it’s a couple of days, but the fact is, the vaccines are coming out. The therapeutics are coming out, and they’re coming out really good. Regeneron and others, other companies, are great, Eli Lilly.\nDonald Trump: (09:50)\nAnd so, we’ll have to see. The survival rate is so much better now than it was. You’ve seen those numbers. I guess 95% or something like that, better. So we’ll have to see. I mean, I’ll get my test back either tonight or tomorrow morning, but I spend a lot of time with Hope and so does the first lady, and she’s tremendous.\nDonald Trump: (10:09)\nI was a little surprised, but she’s a very warm person. She has a hard time when soldiers and law enforcement comes up to her. She wants to treat them great, not say, “Stay away. I can’t get near you.” It’s a very, very tough disease.\nSean Hannity: (10:23)\nLet me ask you this question. You have talked a lot about the issue of voter fraud. And by the way, this was just breaking tonight as we’re coming on the air, that the Trump campaign is suing Philadelphia over mail-in voting offices. We had 100,000 ballots in trouble. The Heritage Foundation identified 1,285 cases of recent voter fraud, including nearly 1,000 convictions on the issues.\nSean Hannity: (10:54)\nWe saw the Trump ballots, military ballots, in a wastepaper basket in Pennsylvania. We had people being mailed absentee ballots, and we had a criminal conviction in New Jersey, attempted to bribe voters with mail-in ballots. Project Veritas came out with a tape. There was a case in Florida. There’s been cases all over Colorado, Florida, Texas.\nDonald Trump: (11:21)\nA scam and everyone knows it, Sean. It’s a scam and everyone knows it.\nSean Hannity: (11:26)\nHow do we have voter integrity, and this idea that Hillary Clinton talked about, you accepting the results of the election, and Hillary said under no circumstances should Joe Biden ever concede the election. Joe said the other night he would under the right circumstances. Do you really foresee a problem? And these last-minute changes that are being made, I mean, to me, it’s incalculable how that then impacts the election. What are your thoughts?\nDonald Trump: (11:56)\nWell, in New York they last 100,000 ballots were sent out wrong. The envelopes were wrong, the names were wrong, everything was wrong. So they said, “Oh, that’s okay. We’ll send out a new 100,000.” Okay, let’s assume they get it right. What happens to 100,000 that they sent out? They’re going to be sent back by somebody and it’s going to be a fraud.\nDonald Trump: (12:13)\nThis is a terrible thing that’s happening to our country. And the only one that knows it better than you and I and other people is the Democrats. They know it, they know it. They’re smart. But I’ll tell you the big hope is that we have great federal judges. And we have a lot of cases in front of these federal judges. And I think they’re really talented, very smart. And I think that we’re going to do very well.\nDonald Trump: (12:37)\nHow about this? The election ends on November 3rd, but they’re giving certain states the right to go another week. So that means we’re not going to know, because they’re big states, that means we’re not going to know the election for another week. Just take a look at New York. Take a look at the one city, the ballots that were thrown into a garbage can and they all had the Trump name on it.\nDonald Trump: (13:03)\nThey were military ballots. They were thrown into a garbage can. The ones that were on a tray and they were thrown into a creek or river, it’s a terrible thing. And if you look at Carolyn Maloney, what they did to that guy that ran against her is a disgrace. That’s in New York, and that’s only for a congressional race.\nDonald Trump: (13:20)\nThey have no idea where the votes are, where the ballots are. This is going to be all over. This is in Virginia. This is in New Jersey. It’s a very, very sad thing. And hopefully we can win by a lot because I have no doubt that they’re going to be doing a number. I have no doubt about it.\nDonald Trump: (13:36)\nAnd the press knows that too. They act so sacrosanct. They act so, “Oh, it’s so terrible. He’s talking about our democracy.” They know what’s going on. It’s really a shame. If the other side did this, you would see everybody would be arrested, put in jail. You have to see what’s going on.\nDonald Trump: (13:55)\nBut the good news is we just got a very good decision in Rhode Island, great decision. We have some great decisions coming down. You have to have the votes in by November 3rd. You have to have it signed. You have to have it certified. They have to guarantee the certification.\nDonald Trump: (14:11)\nI mean, in Nevada, Sean, they don’t want to have any certification of a signature, just do a signature and they don’t want to have certification. I think you don’t even have to sign it. And the governor is a very political person. It’s a ridiculous thing. And we’re going to win Nevada on a fair basis, but it’s very hard when they send millions of ballots out and then they cheat.\nSean Hannity: (14:37)\nLet me ask you, we learned this week, and this is something, we broke a lot of news in the last three and a half years, not really gotten a lot of credit for it, turns out we were right all along that the Obama administration knew in 2016, that they knew Hillary was attempting to tie you to Russia to get away and distract from her subpoenaed emails.\nSean Hannity: (15:01)\nWe also learned that now James Comey, along with Rod Rosenstein, along with Sally H, knowing what they know now, never would’ve signed the FISA applications that denied constitutional rights to Carter Page to spy on your campaign, your transition team, and your presidency. Comey had amnesia on the rest of it.\nSean Hannity: (15:22)\nBut we also learned that Christopher Steele’s source, and that was the bulk of data, Andrew McCabe said, “No Christopher Steele files and Hillary dossier, there would be no FISA warrants.” We now know that all of it was from a guy that our own FBI knew to be a Russian operative for 10 years. We don’t have a lot of time. Your reaction to all of this new news?\nDonald Trump: (15:49)\nWell, it’s a scam. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. The only sad thing is nothing’s happening with them and their a bunch of crooks. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. They tried to do a coup and they got caught. Now we get to see what’s going to happen. It’s time to move.\nDonald Trump: (16:07)\nThis is ridiculous, okay? This is ridiculous. It’s so sad. We caught them spying on our campaign. Never happened before. Spied before and after, and it never happened before. And I watched Comey. He couldn’t remember anything, but he’s writing all these books.\nDonald Trump: (16:22)\nThey’re guilty as hell. They should all be in jail, okay? You know it and I know it. They should all be in jail and it’s disgraceful. It’s a disgrace to our country if they don’t go to jail. Hillary Clinton got caught, Comey got caught, they all got caught. And Biden, by the way, mentioned the Logan Act. That was a big part of it, and Obama too. It’s a disgrace what’s happened, a disgrace. And they should do something about it. They can’t let this just go on ad infinitum. They should do something about it.\nSean Hannity: (16:52)\nLet me ask you very quickly here. This election is in 33 days. In the 45 seconds we have left, you’ve gone through things you want to do, the economy, law and order, safety, security, and a vaccine. Are those your three top things that you want to accomplish?\nDonald Trump: (17:10)\nWell, it is. I mean, it is, but we’ve already rebuilt the military, two and a half trillion dollars. It’s the strongest military in the world by far. We have weapons the likes of which nobody even comes close to. And so we’ve done that. We’ve cut taxes at a record level. If you look at regulations, we’ve cut more regulations than any president in history by far.\nSean Hannity: (17:32)\nWhere will the economy be by the end of this year in your view? You have 20 seconds.\nDonald Trump: (17:35)\nWell, I think better than that. I think you’re going to see some great numbers just two days before, because you’re going to have the third quarter come out just before the election, and I think you’re going to be up anywhere from 22 to 35% in GDP. And if that’s the case, that’s bigger than any economic rebound in history. So I think that’ll be good. Let’s see what happens, but those numbers are coming out sometime prior to November 3rd, which is the election.\nSean Hannity: (17:59)\nAll right, Mr. President. 33 days, the American people, the ultimate jury. Thank you for being with us.\nDonald Trump: (18:05)\nThank you very much, Sean. Thank you.",

         "Ben Carson: (00:01)\n… but a great friend of America, our Vice President, the 48th Vice President of the United States. And I’ll tell you something interesting about him in terms of how much of an influence he’s already been in what’s going on. He has cast as the President of the Senate more tie-breaking votes than the four Vice Presidents before him combined. So he is at the right place at the right time. He served in Congress from 2001 till 2003. He was the 50th Governor of Iowa. And as if that wasn’t enough, he practiced law, was a talk show host on the radio, and has served as a spectacular Vice President so far, providing tremendous leadership on foreign affairs, but also on domestic issues.\nBen Carson: (01:04)\nAs you know, he’s the Chairman of the Coronavirus Task Force. I’m a member of that. I can tell you, he has so rapidly picked up the scientific and medical concepts, I mean, he should have been a doctor. He is really, really good. And being able to coordinate so many things and take diverse points of view and make everybody feel like they’re important. And what’s really interesting, if you think back to March, when about a third of elderly people who were contracting the virus were dying and now 94.7% of them are surviving, so that tells you that he has been very successful on the task force. It has been very successful. He also is a man of great wisdom and perspective who I believe the good Lord has placed here for a time such as this. And this is a very troubling time. I remember when I first took office, a senior government official came to me and said, “You have to stop all this God stuff. You cannot keep talking about God.” And I just told him to take a hike. I said, “Because I’m going to talk about God. I am always going to.” That’s like saying, “Cut your heart out and continue to work.” That really doesn’t work very well. But where did all this no God stuff come from? I don’t think people really know the history of our country and how vital God was to those who started our country. Take George Washington, he was acting as a courier for one of the generals. Back and forth, across dangerous territories, being shot at. And some years later, still before he was President, he came back to the area and one of the Indian chiefs who was very elderly and close to death, had his people carry him to where Washington was.\nBen Carson: (03:37)\nAnd he said, “I just wanted to meet you, sir, because I shot you four times and you’re still here.” And there were, in fact, four bullet holes and Washington’s coat, but no flesh wounds. He was being protected. And many people know the story of the battle of Long Island when Washington was down to his last battalion. We’d been wiped out. It was looking very grim. They were surrounded on land and on sea. And it looked like it was going to be the end of our Revolutionary War. But the meteorologic records, which are still available today, demonstrate that, that evening a very strange, dense fog fell over the area. It lasted through the night and into the next day, providing cover for Washington so that they could escape. And some people want to say that it’s a coincidence. I don’t think that that’s a coincidence.\nBen Carson: (04:44)\nI think God has been involved from the beginning because our founders honored God. A lot of people who want to rewrite our history try to tell you that, “Our founders didn’t believe in God.” All you have to do is go back and look at their writings and I think you’ll be very convinced that they very much did believe in God. And then you have all of the people talking about separation of church and state. You’ll never hear that coming out of Vice President Pence’s mouth. Separation of church and state is not in the U.S. Constitution. It is not there. Nowhere. And there was a Supreme Court ruling a few decades ago where it was mentioned but only in the context that the state should not rule the church and the church should not rule the state. That’s all it meant. It didn’t mean that people who work in government cannot speak and act upon their faith.\nBen Carson: (05:49)\nAnd when Alexis de Tocqueville came to America to study it, because Americans were doing so well, this young fledgling nation, and no one could explain it. And he said, “I’m going to go there and I’m going to study them in depth.” And in the last chapter of that two volumes that he talked about the influence of the church. The fiery pulpits, which gave the people, their courage and their moral rectitude enough to be able to defeat the most powerful military force in the world. So faith is a big part of us. It’s a big part of us as individuals too if we stop and examine our lives. I remember when I was a young attending neurosurgeon and I thought I was pretty hot stuff. And there came this young child from Georgia who was four years old. He was a child prodigy. At age two, he was already quoting Bible verses. But when he was four, he started stumbling. He started slobbering. He had double vision and he was diagnosed with malignant brainstem tumor.\nBen Carson: (07:05)\nAnd they saw many people. Everybody gave him the same diagnosis, told them to take the boy home, keep them comfortable and let them die. And they ended up at Johns Hopkins. And I remember seeing that boy come in to the ward rolled on a stretcher and his eyes were looking in different directions, foaming at the mouth, barely moving, barely breathing. I was saying, “What am I supposed to do with him?” I looked at the CAT scan. There was this big, ugly brainstem tumor. And the parents said, “Doctor, we were directed here by God because we would find a Christian neurosurgeon who could heal our son.” And I said, “But this is a malignant brainstem tumor. There’s nothing I or anyone else can do about this.” And they said, “But doctor, the Lord sent us here to see you.” I said, “Okay, I tell you what.” I said, “Let’s do an MRI.” MRIs were new at that time. I said, “Maybe it’ll show something the CAT scan doesn’t show.”\nBen Carson: (08:16)\nWe did the MRI. All the neuroradiologists looked at it. They said, “It’s a malignant brainstem tumor. Nothing to do.” I came back and told them. And they said, “But doctor, the Lord.” I said, ” Okay.” I said, “Look, one in 1000 times the scans are wrong. So maybe this is some kind of inflammatory reaction. So I’ll go in and I’ll do a biopsy.” And they said, “Oh, thank you, doctor. Thank you.” And I went in and there was this big, ugly grayish red mass, and I took a frozen section biopsy, sent it off. It came back high grade glioma, a very malignant tumor. And I took out as much as I dared until I started running across vital structures. I said, “I better stop.” Closed him up, went out to talk to the parents. And I said, “Unfortunately, it looks like it is what we thought. And only God knows how long a person is supposed to be here. Maybe he’s already served his purpose and we’ll understand it better by and by,” and all the things we tell people.\nBen Carson: (09:27)\nAnd they said, “Thank you, doctor. But the Lord is going to heal her son.” As I walked away, I was thinking, I’ve never seen people with that kind of faith fully expecting over the next few days he would deteriorate and die. But instead, his eyes started looking in the same direction. He started handling his secretions. I said, “What’s going on?” I said, “Let’s do another MRI.” And we did and there was still a big early tumor. But there was a little ribbon of tissue way up in the corner, and I said, “Is it possible that maybe this was not in the brainstem, it just crushed and displaced the brainstem. Maybe I should go back in.” And they said, “By all means.” And I went back in and the nature of that tumor was different. And as I peeled it away layer by layer under the microscope, I got to the last layer and pulled it away. And there was a brainstem glistening white, intact, smashed, and displaced. Long story short, that boy walked out of the hospital and today he’s a minister.\nBen Carson: (10:44)\nThose are the kinds of things that build faith. And one of the oncologists told me after that, he said, “Ben, I’ve always been an atheist. I’m not anymore.” But the fact of the matter was really for me because I thought I was doing all this stuff. And I came to realize, as Vice President Pence fully realizes, that it is God, that he uses us as instruments if we are willing to allow him to use us. And Vice President Pence recognizes that the election that we’re facing, it’s not about Democrats or Republicans. It’s about people who believe that this country is of, for, and by the people and people who believe it’s of, for, and by the government. And people who believe in our Judeo-Christian foundation and those who think that that’s a bunch of silliness. And it is so important for people to recognize that this is about not a person or a personality, this is about concepts.\nBen Carson: (11:51)\nThis is about the future for our children and our grandchildren. We cannot be thrown off because we don’t like somebody or the way that they say something. That’s really taking the small view. And that’s something that our Vice President does not do. He is a man who lives by Godly principles of loving your fellow man, caring about your neighbor, developing your God given talents to the utmost so that you become valuable to the people around you, having values and principles that govern his life. And we are very, very fortunate to have with us today, the 48th Vice President of the United States, Michael Richard Pence.\nVice President Mike Pence: (12:44)\nWell, hello Iowa. To Bob Vanderplatz, his wife, Darla, all of my fellow Americans, it’s great to be back in the Hawkeye State with all of the amazing men and women of The Family Leader. Give yourselves a round of applause. What a great organization. It’s great to be here today just 33 days from what I believe will be a great victory for faith and family all across Iowa and all across America. And I want to thank Dr. Ben Carson for those inspiring words and for his friendship. Abraham Lincoln said his only ambition in life was to be esteemed.\nVice President Mike Pence: (14:02)\nAbraham Lincoln said his only ambition in life was to be esteemed by people he esteemed. And I have to tell you, America is blessed by the steady, principled, faith filled leadership of Dr. Ben Carson. Would you join me in thanking Ben Carson for all that he means to the life of this nation? We cherish you and Candy so much. Ben and I have gotten to know each other over the last several years, serving shoulder to shoulder and a better man I’ve never known, but Ben does know that the introduction I prefer is a little bit shorter. I’m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican in that order. And it is wonderful to be here with The Family Leader. And I want to say, thanks also to Bob Vander Plaats and his amazing wife Darla, for all they’ve done for the cause of conservative and pro family values here in Iowa. And in more than a dozen states across the country, Bob and Darla for all you’ve done strengthening families. For all you’ve done to promote faith and leadership and revival. Can we hear it for Bob and Darla and The Family Leader team for all they’ve done? Thank you all for being a part of this vital ministry in the life of the nation. We’re so grateful.\nVice President Mike Pence: (15:28)\nYou know, Bob and The Family Leader, are really emblematic of a very rich tradition in the United States of America. Even a casual study of the history of this nation shows that people of faith have made the difference throughout our country’s history. From the very founding of the nation, the Robed Regiments of the American revolution, the preachers of revival in our great awakenings, the way that the pulpits of America thundered for abolition of slavery and led the Civil Rights Movement. It has been people of faith, I believe with all of my heart who have led us toward a more perfect union. And I want to congratulate and thank each and every one of you for being a part of continuing that great American tradition.\nVice President Mike Pence: (16:24)\nBut it’s so good to be here with so many friends, including a man, who I thought he was from Minnesota. But he is a man of faith who’s been a champion of everything that we hold dear. And he actually was kind enough to bring my sister and my niece down from Minnesota. Would you join me in thanking Mike Lindell and the whole team that’s down from My Pillow. Thanks for all you do for people of faith and the conservative cause, Mike.\nVice President Mike Pence: (16:59)\nSo thanks to all the friends who are here and speaking of friends, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. A man who I can tell you firsthand, has fought to keep the promises that he’s made to people of faith. People dedicated to family, people who believe in freedom, every single day. The last three and a half years, I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. I don’t know if y’all had a chance to see that debate night before last. I’ll tell you what, if you ever doubted that we had a fighter in the White house, you don’t doubt it anymore. President Donald Trump took our case to the American people, and he took the fight to Joe Biden. And, case you didn’t know it. I’m headed to Salt Lake City next week to debate with his running mate. And I promise you, President Trump and I are going to keep on fighting for faith, and family, and freedom. And we’re going to fight 33 days to earn four more years in the White House.\nVice President Mike Pence: (18:08)\nAnd we’re going to tell our story and I challenge each and every one of you to do the same. Because we’ve got an incredible story to tell about what we’ve accomplished for this country. I mean, the truth is President Trump has literally kept the promises that he’s made to the people of Iowa and all the states so well-represented here at The Family Leader, but think about it. Four years ago, we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts. An economy, struggling to break out of the slowest economic recovery since the great depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world. And worst of all, we had this eight years of a steady assault on our most cherished values and liberties.\nVice President Mike Pence: (18:57)\nAnd I’m here to tell you three and a half years on, from when the people of Iowa said, “Yes” to President Donald Trump, I couldn’t can be more proud to report, not just as your vice president, but as the father of a Marine and the proud father-in-law of a United States Navy pilot, we rebuilt our military. We restored the arsenal of democracy. President Donald Trump has signed the largest increases in our National Defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And we’re finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and space force, the resources and the support that they need to defend this land of freedom.\nVice President Mike Pence: (19:46)\nAnd with that renewed American strength, under the president it’s leadership, our armed forces have taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms, on their soil. Where Joe sent pallets of cash to the mullahs in Iran, president Donald Trump got us out of the Iranian nuclear deal. And I was there, when president Donald Trump, without hesitation gave the order to take out the world’s most dangerous terrorists and Qasem Soleimani is gone.\nVice President Mike Pence: (20:17)\nThe President Donald Trump has put the security of America first. And in our first three years, our president also took decisive action to revive the American economy. Where Joe Biden has plans to raise taxes across the board. President Donald Trump has cut taxes for small businesses and large, cut taxes for working families. We rolled back in those first three years, more federal red tape already than any president in American history. We unleashed American energy. We fought for free and fair trade. And in just three short years, businesses, large and small, created more than 7 million good paying jobs, including nearly 12,000 jobs right here in Iowa.\nVice President Mike Pence: (21:09)\nSo it’s been about security. It’s been about prosperity, in these first three years. And every step of the way your president, and our administration have stood for the rule of law and the principles we cherish. So I stand before you today, we’ve seen confirmed more than 230 conservative judges to our federal courts at every level. And I can tell you, they are all men and women who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our constitution. Like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms\nVice President Mike Pence: (21:49)\nLast week, we paused as a nation to honor the life of service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But after the memorials were over, President Donald Trump did his duty. The Constitution provides that the president shall nominate judges to the Supreme Court in the event of a vacancy. And president Donald Trump did just that when he nominated a remarkable, principled, conservative woman of amazing intellect and a beautiful family who will uphold the constitution of the United States to our Supreme Court. He nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Two days ago, I had the privilege of escorting Judge Barrett to the United States Senate. And she’s on Capitol Hill all this week. Meeting with members of the Senate. We challenged Democrats in the Senate to provide Judge Barrett with a respectful and dignified hearing, and to give America the kind of confirmation process American people deserve. But we have reason to be concerned. You all remember her last confirmation hearing just a few short years ago, when she was nominated to the court of appeals. During Judge Barrett’s confirmation hearing the Democrat chairman of the judiciary committee, criticized her Catholic faith. Saying that “The dogma lives loudly within you.” And Hollywood elites have already begun to criticize her and her family for their commitment to their faith. Well, I got news for the Democrats and the Hollywood elites that dogma lives loudly in me, that dogma lives loudly in hundreds of millions of Americans. And every American who cherishes faith has the right to live and work and worship according to the dictates of our faith and conscience enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. The American people cherish the freedom of religion of every American and every faith. And these attacks on Judge Barrett’s faith must stop.\nVice President Mike Pence: (24:18)\nThe Senate has a job to do, to discharge their duty, to advise and consent. And we’ll work with any willing member of the Senate to do just that. But I tell you, we’re going to fill that seat. And Judge Amy Coney Barrett is going to be Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court of the United States. So president Trump has stood for the rule of law. He kept his word to the people of Iowa and all the great states represented here and all of our country. He appointed those principled conservatives to our courts at every level, all the way through Judges Barrett’s nomination. And every single day of this administration, President Donald Trump and I have stood without apology for the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement.\nVice President Mike Pence: (25:18)\nI think people in The Family Leader know, men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in it in this country. President Trump and I, like all of you, will always support and defend the Constitutional right of every American to engage in peaceful protest. But rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech. Violence against innocent civilians or property, or law enforcement, will not be tolerated. And those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. For months, all Joe Biden talked about was peaceful protests. Remember that? An entire summer. As Americans living in our major cities, literally watched businesses in their communities burn. Mike, I was just in Minneapolis, just a few short days ago. And I traveled into the heart of the city that had been beset by the rioting, and the looting, and the violence that followed the killing of George Floyd. I spent some time with Flora Westborough, an extraordinary African-American woman. She started a Flora’s Salon, 35 years ago, and yet she watched in horror just days after that terrible event, as looters moved closer and closer and closer, and burned her and her son’s business to the ground. But I told Flora, we are with you, the American people are with you. And we’re going to rebuild Flora’s Salon and Minneapolis.\nVice President Mike Pence: (27:07)\nAnd so we are. The truth is, Joe Biden would actually double down on the policies that have led to violence in America’s cities. When you withdraw support for those who serve and protect, I believe that you embolden those who threaten our families, and our peace in the streets. Joe Biden actually says that America is in his words, systemically racist. And that law enforcement has, and I quote, “An implicit bias against minorities.” When Joe Biden was asked if he’d support cutting funding for law enforcement, he replied. “Yes, absolutely.”\nVice President Mike Pence: (27:50)\nAnd his running mate said again, earlier this week, that it was time to quote, “Re-imagine law enforcement.” Well, let me make you a promise, under President Donald Trump-\nVice President Mike Pence: (28:03)\nWell, let me make you a promise, under President Donald Trump we’re not going to re-imagine anything, we’re going to back the blue, and we’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. President Trump and I know you don’t have to make a choice between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors or other minorities in our communities, we have done both and we’ll continue to do both with four more years in the White House. Under this president, we’ve provided resources to hire 4,000 more police officers, this summer in the wake of violence in our cities we launched Operation Legend and we’ve already seen to the arrest of more than 2,500 violent offenders in our major cities. The program itself was named after a four year old boy who was shot and killed in gang violence while he slept in the pillow fort that he and his dad constructed.\nVice President Mike Pence: (28:58)\nSo, we’ve supported law enforcement, but I couldn’t be more proud to be vice president to a president whose policies saw in our first three years the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African-Americans, the highest investment in historically Black colleges and universities, 8,000 opportunity zones in every major city attracting investment and jobs, and a president who has fought to let parents in our inner cities choose where their children go to school regardless of their income or area code. So we’re going to continue to support law enforcement, we’re going to continue to support our African-American families with better opportunities, better education, and more public safety. And under President Donald Trump, we’re going to have law and order in every city, in every state in this nation, for every American of every race, and creed, and color, so help us, God. So we’ve made incredible progress.\nVice President Mike Pence: (30:05)\nBut as supporters and friends of The Family Leader know, in President Donald Trump you’ve had a leader whose kept his promises to people of faith like no other in my lifetime. It’s remarkable to think that four previous presidents in both political parties had promised the American people and our most cherished ally to take action, but it was President Donald Trump who kept that promise when he moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. And I was alongside the president when the phone started to ring and he was preparing to keep that promise, Bob, and to say that virtually every leader in the world and every foreign policy elite in Washington, DC was against, would be an understatement. I mean, one called after another, didn’t they, Ben? They said, “Don’t do it.” They said that it would make peace less possible, but President Donald Trump believed that it would make peace more possible.\nVice President Mike Pence: (31:15)\nThe man who wrote The Art of the Deal had the view that if you want to negotiate peace, the first thing you do is you take off the table what’s not negotiable, and Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish State of Israel. And confirming the president since, I don’t know if you all saw just a couple short weeks ago, for the first time in 26 years two Arab nations formally recognized the Jewish State of Israel and we believe there are more on the way. Beyond the strong stand and the keeping of promises, I will tell you, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history, it’s true. On just our fourth day in office, the president re-instated what’s known as the Mexico City policy, ending taxpayer funding of foreign programs that provide or promote abortion around the world.\nVice President Mike Pence: (32:51)\nAnd it was this president who earlier this year became the first president since Roe v. Wade to go to the National Mall and address the March for Life in person, we stand with those who stand for life. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and the radical left support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, they’re calling for historic increases in funding for Planned Parenthood of America. And after spending an entire career since Roe vs. Wade, supporting what came to be known as the Hyde Amendment, a great piece of legislation by the late Henry Hyde that prevented taxpayer dollars from being used to pay for abortions in America, last year Joe Biden reversed his historic position in support of the Hyde Amendment and now supports taxpayer funding of abortion. I must tell you, and Ben mentioned how many tie-breaking votes I’ve cast as vice president, but I got to tell you, the one I’m proudest of was the day I was able to cast the tie-breaking vote in the United States Senate to allow states to defund planned parenthood, and President Donald Trump signed it into law. So, we’ve stood for life. And from day one, this president has also stood strong for what’s come to be known as our first freedom, that is religious freedom enshrined in our constitution. Early on in our administration, the president took steps to free up the pulpits of America. We believe that the freedom of speech should not end at the front doors of our churches, and synagogues, and houses of worship, and President Donald Trump stopped enforcement of the Johnson Amendment and restored the freedom of speech, the leaders of faith. We’ve also taken steps to respect the conscience rights of doctors, and nurses, and teachers, and religious charities all across America. And it was this president and this administration that ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor, and the Supreme Court made it permanent just weeks ago. It’s remarkable to think that a group of nuns who had taken a lifetime vow of poverty to support and help the underserved community, were hauled into court when Joe Biden was vice president for the sole purpose of requiring them to compromise their faith to live under the strictures of Obamacare.\nVice President Mike Pence: (36:05)\nThe Supreme Court actually voted by seven to two to make permanent the efforts to conform the Little Sisters of the Poor to Obamacare, but Joe Biden has already announced that if elected president he’ll reimpose the Obamacare mandates on the Little Sisters of the Poor and on religious institutions, and his own running mate actually attacked one of our judicial nominees for being a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. So let me just say, these attacks on the freedom of religion must stop in America, and with four more years we will stand for the religious freedom of every American of every faith. So we accomplished so much in our first three years, we rebuilt our military, revived our economy, stood for life, and our liberties, and law and order, and the faith and freedom of every American. In three short years, as I like to say, we made America great again, we did. But then, as Ben shared, and he’s a valued member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, then the coronavirus struck from China. But I want you all to know that before the very first documented case of community transmission within the United States, our president did what no American president had ever done before. Before the month of January was out, he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Joe Biden called it hysterical, he called it xenophobic. But I can tell you as the head of the task force, that action alone saved untold American lives and it bought us invaluable time to stand up the largest national mobilization since World War II. We’ve reinvented testing, more than 100 million tests performed today, 150 million new point of care tests that are being distributed to states all across the country as we speak. We worked with manufacturing here in Iowa and all across the country to see to the production and the distribution of literally billions of medical supplies for our doctors, and nurses, and healthcare workers.\nVice President Mike Pence: (38:39)\nOur FDA worked to make new medicines available like remdesivir and convalescent plasma. And I’m proud to report to you that with American innovation, our dedicated researchers, we believe, are just literally weeks away from the first coronavirus vaccine for the American people, and we’ll have tens of millions of doses available the moment that it’s approved. We’ve demonstrated as a nation that we can slow the spread, we’re going to continue to protect the vulnerable, continue to save lives, and we’re opening up America again. Thanks to the strong foundation poured by our president, supported by all of you, that foundation of less taxes, less regulation, more American energy, after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, we’ve already seen 10.6 million Americans go back to work including 97,000 people right here in Iowa.\nVice President Mike Pence: (39:49)\nAnd we’re not just opening up America, we’re opening up American schools. And I’m proud to report to you that my wife of 35 years is already back in the classroom at the Christian School, outside Washington, DC, where she teaches every day. We’ve been there for our doctors, our nurses, our healthcare workers, and we’re going to make sure our teachers and administrators have everything they need to safely reopen as we strive for that day with a vaccine that we put the coronavirus in the past. It’s remarkable to think what we’ve been through over the course of this year, we’ve gone through a time of testing, but I came here today, as all of you know at The Family Leader, because we’re coming to a time for choosing. The choice in this election has never been clear, the stakes have never been higher. I believe that when you look at their agenda, it’s clear that Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left.\nVice President Mike Pence: (40:49)\nI mean, Joe Biden has said that democracy is on the ballot, and certainly our economic recovery is on the ballot, law and order are on the ballot, but I also believe that there are things much more foundational and fundamental that are on the ballot as well. I think between now and November 3rd, it’s not going to be so much whether we end up more Republican or more Democrat, more liberal or more conservative, more red or more blue, I think the choice we face in this nation, in this year, is whether America remains America. It’s whether we are going to chart a course for our children and grandchildren and a future that’s based on the timeless ideals enshrined in our constitution, our belief in free enterprise and free market and the American dream, or whether we’re going to take that hard left turn, the well-worn path, the government control, and a managed economy, the path to socialism. That’s why I believe for the sake of our freedom…\nVice President Mike Pence: (42:01)\nThat’s why I believe for the sake of our freedom, for the sake of all the ideals that have made this nation truly great in the past. We need to decide right here and right now, that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States of America, that we’re going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. So, I thank you for hearing me out. I thank you for your faith, for your enthusiasm and for all the family leader’s done to stand with those who stand with our most cherished values, each and every day. It truly is an honor to be with you here. I’d encourage you in the days ahead, to keep telling your neighbors and friends, at work and at worship, that all that we’ve accomplished as a nation, and all that’s at stake in the days ahead. And be confident as you go.\nVice President Mike Pence: (43:03)\nIn all my travels across the country, over the last four years, to big cities and small towns, I’m convinced of two things. That America is a freedom loving nation, and America is a nation of faith. Everywhere I go, people speak to me about their faith, with a word of encouragement. Sweetest words I ever hear, is when people will say as they did over at Carter Lake earlier today. Reach out maybe across a rope line and just say, “I’m praying for you.” And I want you all to know, we feel those prayers every day. I think the American people know that the foundation of America is freedom, but the foundation of freedom is faith. The truth is, faith is at the very heart of who we are as Americans. And I believe the foundation of this country is strengthened each and every day, by the stand that each and every one of you take.\nVice President Mike Pence: (44:17)\nPresident Lincoln reminded us, “It is the duty of nations as well as of men, to recognize the sublime truth announced in the Holy scriptures and proven by all histories, that those nations are only blessed whose God is the Lord.” And so as I leave here today, in these challenging times, and urge you to hold fast to freedom, let’s also hold fast to faith, and let’s remember to pray. The Bible tells us, “That the prayer of the upright pleases him. That prayer reaches heaven, his Holy dwelling place.” And then in times of great challenge in our life or in the life of the nation, we’re not to be anxious about anything, but in everything, in every form of prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, we’re to present our request to God, and know that the peace of God that passes all understanding will guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.\nVice President Mike Pence: (45:23)\nAs Ben Carson said, “We’re passing through difficult days as a nation. Too much division in our country today. An election of such a consequence, may well be one of the most important elections in the life of this nation.” But I believe more than ever, that people of faith should pray. And coming here today, I want to encourage you, practice that prayer in a renewed way. As we think of the challenges and the times in which we live, the more than 200,000 of our countrymen that have been lost. We think of the grief of those families who have always been on our hearts. Those that are struggling with disease today, as we think of the economic hardship that people still face, in the midst of the recovery that’s underway. We think of the violence besetting families in our major cities. Let’s claim that ancient promise, that if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray in turn, he’ll do like he’s always done in the long and storied history of this country. He’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land.\nVice President Mike Pence: (46:38)\nSo, thank you for the warm welcome. I was humbled by what Bob Vanderplatz said, that I’m coming to you today, but you said, “I come from you.” And I hope you can hear my heart today. And while I’m at it, standing here in Iowa, let me say, it is the greatest honor of my life to serve as your vice-president. And on behalf of my family, I want to thank you for the great privilege of serving in this role for yours. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nVice President Mike Pence: (47:46)\nMy pastor told me one time that, “Everybody is under-encouraged.” And I can tell you that I leave here today encouraged. Know that you’ve encouraged your vice-president. I know you’ve encouraged Ben and Candy, and all those in our delegation today and we thank you. And I leave here today, believing more than ever that God is at work.\nVice President Mike Pence: (48:08)\nAs I close, let me just share a story. It was a few months ago, I was reminded that even when it doesn’t seem that way, God is still working. See, I got a letter, from a pastor who leads a small church, just outside Jacksonville, Florida. He wrote to me of a time many years ago, that he and his wife were attending Asbury Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky, it’s back in the 1970s. It was a place where they held in the spring of every year, a Christian music festival. Where they would have music, and then they would have preachers who would present the Gospel and invite young people from all across the region.\nVice President Mike Pence: (48:54)\nBut he wrote to me that in 1977, he had decided at the seminary, they had collectively decided to end the Christian music festival, it was known as Ichthus. But he and his new bride, felt a burden to take on the task. Even though he wrote, and I quote, “That several friends told us that it would be very hard on our new marriage and we shouldn’t do it.” But he said, “We answered the call. They gathered a few other seminarians, as he told me, and they worked a whole year long to arrange the event in the spring of 1978. And then he told me, that the night came, the culminating evening on Saturday night, when everything was to come together, and the main preaching was done. And he and his new bride were walking through the camp area, and it was raining and they were deeply disappointed. They thought it had all been for naught.\nVice President Mike Pence: (49:58)\nAnd then, he wrote these words in a letter, I quote, “And that’s because on that night, I didn’t know that a future vice-president of the United States of America would be giving his life to Jesus Christ.” He continued, “I cannot write this without tears. And I still can’t read it without tears. Because I remember that night, sitting on a hillside, it was raining and it was like I heard the words for the first time. That God so loved the world. That he sent his only begotten son, that whoever might believe in him might not perish, but have eternal life.\nVice President Mike Pence: (50:46)\nAnd that 19-year-old young man stood up and walked down that night, not out of a sense of intellectual agreement, but because my heart was broken with gratitude, for what had been done for me on the cross. I wrote a letter to that pastor, which I couldn’t write without tears. Not long after that, we actually met him and his wife and laughed together and prayed together. But I told him, “Now I know who else to thank for that night so many years ago, it changed my life.” The lesson in that letter to me though, was even when things don’t seem like they’re going the way we expect, they’re going the way he expected. The truth is, in the most challenging times in our nation, we can still claim a promise that we’ve had over the mantle of our home for now nearly 20 years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (51:57)\nI traveled to the little house that we lived in while we served in the Congress. It traveled to the governor’s residence in Indiana. And now, it’s over the mantle, in the home of the vice-presidency. It reads, “For I know the plans I have for you. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you a hope and a future.” I believe with all my heart, that if we will hold fast to him, we have a hold fast to his promises, if we will hold up the example, the strength that comes through faith in Jesus Christ, that it will once again, be people of faith that see our way through these challenging times. That a hope and a future awaits beyond anything we could ask or imagine. And the best days for Iowa and America by God’s grace, are yet to come. Thank you very much. Thank you for the honor of being with you today. For all the work of the family leader and God bless America.",

         "Mike Pence: (00:27)\nWell, hello, Iowa. It’s great to be with all of you. To my friend, David Young, to the amazing Ben Carson and his wonderful wife, Candy. What great words. To Iowa’s own and our former acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker. To all my fellow Americans from near and far, it is great to be back in the Hawkeye State, especially be here at Carter Lake with Tyler Owen and all the great men and women of one of the premier manufacturing facilities in the country, PVS Structures. And it’s especially great to be here just 33 days away from another great victory all across the state of Iowa and all across America when we reelect President Donald Trump for four more years.\nCrowd: (01:33)\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years.\nMike Pence: (01:46)\nSo thank you all for coming out today. It really is wonderful to see you and the warm reception we arrived since we landed on the other side of the river. But it is great to be with you all. And please, if you got a seat, grab one. I got a lot to say. It’s a privilege to be here with all of you, but I also want to mention that seventh generation Iowan that you just heard from. He served a couple of terms in the Congress of the United States. He was a champion for Iowa’s families, service members, veterans, and farmers. He is a man of integrity, a man of principle. And I am here to ask all of you to send David Young back to a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives. But David Young and I are really here for one reason, and one reason only. Just like all of you, we know that Iowa and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. It’s on, Carter Lake. And the road to victory goes straight through Iowa.\nMike Pence: (02:57)\nAnd if you didn’t know it was on, maybe you missed that debate the other night. I mean, I’ll tell you what. President Donald Trump took our case to the American people, and he took the fight to Joe Biden. And we’re going to keep on fighting for 33 days all the way to victory on November the third. As the president said, he held Joe Biden accountable for 47 years of failure. Shipping jobs and dreams abroad, and bowing to the violent mob. And I promise you, we’re going to keep taking that case every single day. It’s amazing to think how far we’ve come and the story that we have to tell the people of Iowa. I mean, four years ago, a movement was born. A movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. Here in Iowa, you believe we could be strong again. You believe we could be prosperous again. You said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016, and I just know that Iowa’s going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020. And it’s because of what we’ve done. It’s because of what we’ve done under this president’s leadership.\nMike Pence: (04:17)\nI mean, four years ago, we inherited a military that was hollowed out by years of devastating budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world, and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values and liberties. But in three short years, with President Donald Trump in the White House with strong allies on Capitol Hill, this father of a United States Marine is proud to report to you we rebuilt our military. We restored the arsenal of democracy and we are finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guard, and Space Force the resources they need to defend this nation.\nMike Pence: (05:11)\nI mean, I mentioned to you my son’s a Marine, but my unworthy son-in-law is a Navy pilot. He’s actually currently deployed, serving overseas. And I’ll tell you what, not just as your vice president, but having members of our armed forces and their spouses in my immediate family, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families and our veterans. Under the president’s leadership, we’ve stood with those who serve. And we’ve stood with all of you who wore the uniform of the United States as never before. In fact, if you’re able, if you served in the armed forces of the United States, will the men and women in the room who served in our armed forces, will you mind just standing up or raising your hand so we can say thank you one more time? Thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you. Thank you for your service. We can never say thanks enough.\nMike Pence: (06:23)\nIt’s amazing to think when Joe Biden was vice president, America lived through years of scandal at the VA that literally shocked the conscience of the nation. We saw one story after another, literally tens of thousands of our veterans passed away waiting for the care that they had earned in the uniform of the United States. But when President Donald Trump came into office, we passed the Veterans Accountability Act, the most sweeping reforms of the VA in 50 years. We fired thousands of VA workers that were not providing the healthcare that our veterans deserve. And now Veterans Choice is available for every veteran in America.\nMike Pence: (07:16)\nWe didn’t just rebuild our military, support our vets, but ever since this president came into office, after years of that slow recovery out of the recession of 2008, in our first three years, it was jobs, jobs, jobs. Where Joe Biden wants to raise taxes, President Trump cut taxes across the board in our first three years. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history already. We unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade. And in just three short years, seven million jobs created all across America. Including 11,000 jobs right here in the Hawkeye State. And Iowa saw its lowest unemployment rate in more than 20 years. And it wasn’t just overall jobs in those first three years, it was that wages were rising. I got to tell you, the president and I couldn’t have been more proud that wages were rising across the board, the fastest rate in 10 years. But they were rising most rapidly for hard working blue collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no more.\nMike Pence: (08:39)\nWhen Joe Biden was vice president, America actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And the last president said about this time four years ago, remember? He essentially told the American people those manufacturing jobs were never coming back. Right? Remember he asked that famous question, what magic wand do you have? Well, we didn’t need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. 500,000 manufacturing jobs created in just three years. I’m telling you. I’m telling you, I come from another I state. I’m from Indiana. It’s a whole lot like Iowa. We got a Hoosier in the room, that’s encouraging. I got to tell you, Iowa, like Indiana, you do two things really well. You make things and you grow things. And I want to promise you, you have a president who is a champion for the American people who make things. We’re going to fight to make manufacturing bigger and better than ever before in the next four years. And on the subject of-\nMike Pence: (10:03)\nAnd on the subject of growing things in this great farming state, I don’t think I need to tell all of you, that President Trump has always put family farmers and ranchers first. In those tax cuts, we passed, we basically eliminated death taxes for virtually every family farm in America. Death is no longer a taxable event. We also allowed for the immediate expensing of equipment costs. Our farmers know those input costs are the biggest challenge in agriculture. It was this president who repealed the Biden and Obama era waters of the USA rule and restored private property rights for land owners, all across Iowa and all across America.\nMike Pence: (10:55)\nAnd where past administration turned their backs on farmers, and especially ethanol producers, President Trump told the people of this great state that our administration would expand ethanol markets, and that’s exactly what we’ve done. Last year, the president went to Council Bluffs and announced that E15 is now available year round. That’s what we call promises made and promises kept.\nMike Pence: (11:26)\nAnd can I tell all of you here? Can I tell all of you here at Carter Lake? None of that would have been possible without your president’s leadership, without the strong and tenacious support of Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Joni Ernst, we need Senator Joni Ernst back in the United States Senate for six more years.\nMike Pence: (11:52)\nThe progress that we made in rebuilding this economy, that’s also why we need David Young, Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Randy Feenstra, and from across the river in Nebraska, we need Congressman Don Bacon back in a new Republican majority. We need to retire Nancy Pelosi once and for all.\nMike Pence: (12:18)\nSo in those first three years, with great allies, just like those men and women, we stood strong for our national defense, with our veterans, for jobs, with our farmers, and our ranchers, and president Donald Trump has stood for the rule of law every single day. I’m proud to report to you as we stand here today in Iowa, this president has already seen confirmed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And I can tell you, all of those jurors are men and women of integrity who will uphold all the God-given liberties enshrined in our constitution. Like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms.\nMike Pence: (13:29)\nNow one week ago, as a nation, we paused to honor the life of service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. When the memorials were over, President Donald Trump did his duty, under the constitution of the United States, and last Saturday, he nominated a principled conservative woman of extraordinary character and extraordinary intellect who reveres the Constitution to the Supreme Court of the United States. He nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be the next justice on the Supreme Court.\nMike Pence: (14:13)\nI had the privilege of escorting Judge Barrett to the United States Senate earlier this week. She’s in the process of making the rounds. Next week, we expect, in about a week or so, there’ll be a hearing on Capitol Hill and then there’ll be a vote. But I’ll tell you what, as members of the Senate and the Republican party, and I believe and hope, members in the democratic party, see her character, understand her intellect, see her deep commitment to the Constitution of the United States of America. After they provide advice and consent. I believe that Judge Amy Coney Barrett is going to be Justice amy Coney Barrett, we’re going to fill that seat on the Supreme Court of the United States.\nMike Pence: (15:12)\nSo we’ve stood for the rule of law, strengthened the constitutional foundations in our country through the appointment of principled men and women to our courts, and President Donald Trump has stood every day with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will.\nMike Pence: (15:43)\nI know that’s for them.\nMike Pence: (15:45)\nNow, you all know what the president and I know, the men and women who serve in law enforcement across this country are some of the best people in America. My uncle was a cop in Chicago for 25 years. When we were young, we’d drive up from that small town in Indiana I grew up in and visit my grandparents’ house and when we’d see my uncle walk out wearing that uniform with a sidearm on. I just remember looking up at him and looking up to him. All of my heroes wear uniforms.\nMike Pence: (16:26)\nAnd those who serve in law enforcement deserve the respect of every American every day.\nMike Pence: (16:39)\nNow, president Trump and I will always support the constitutional right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting, like you saw here in Iowa, Des Moines not long ago is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech. Violence against innocent civilians or law enforcement will not be tolerated and those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\nMike Pence: (17:15)\nNow for months, all Joe Biden ever talked about was peaceful protesters, remember? All summer long, as people in our major cities literally watched their streets and businesses burn. I mean, the truth is Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that have led to violence in America cities. When you erode support or signal a withdrawal of support from those who serve and protect, you only embolden those who would do harm to our families.\nMike Pence: (17:52)\nNow, Joe Biden justifies all of it by saying that America is in his words, “Systemically racist.” He said that police have a quote, “Implicit bias against minorities.” When he was asked if he’d support cutting funding for law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, “Yes, absolutely.” Let me make you a promise, under President Donald Trump, we’re going to back the blue. We’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. President Trump and I know that we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors and families and other minorities in our major cities. We have done both for the last four years, and we’re going to keep doing both for four more years.\nMike Pence: (18:59)\nWe’re going to support law enforcement with more resources for better training and accountability, and we’re going to continue to expand educational choice opportunities and job opportunities and safety for our African American families. We’re going to have law and order in every city, in every state in America for every American of every race and creed and color. So help us God. So we rebuilt our military, we revived our economy, we stood for all of our most cherished liberties in law and order. In three short years under this president’s leadership, we made America great again. It’s true. Our economy was booming, America was standing tall, our most cherished liberties more secure. Then the Coronavirus struck from China, but I’m here to …\nMike Pence: (20:03)\nCoronavirus struck from China, but I’m here to report to you that before the first case of community transmission occurred anywhere in America, President Donald Trump did what no American president had ever done when he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world.\nMike Pence: (20:19)\nNow, Joe Biden said that was hysterical and xenophobic, but as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, I can tell you firsthand President Trump’s action saved untold American lives, and it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. That’s true.\nMike Pence: (20:51)\nIn that time, we reinvented testing. We just cleared more than 100 million tests across this country, more than any other nation on Earth, and we just purchased 150 million new tests that are being distributed all across the nation, little 15-minute tests you can carry in your shirt pocket. We saw to the manufacturer working with industries just like this one to manufacture personal protective equipment and saw billions of supplies delivered to hospitals and nurses.\nMike Pence: (21:19)\nI believe the American people can be proud that no American who ever required an ICU bed was ever denied an ICU bed and no American who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator anywhere in the United States.\nMike Pence: (21:40)\nWe’re continuing to meet this moment. New medicines are available, remdesivir, convalescent plasma. I can tell you, I heard it again when our task force met at the White House, we are on track to have the first coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year, and we will have tens of millions of doses for the American people. So we’re slowing the spread. We’re going to keep protecting the vulnerable. We’re going to keep saving lives, and we’re going to keep opening up America again. Having lost 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, I’m proud to report to you with a jobs report just around the corner tomorrow. But as of today, 10.6 million Americans have already gone back to work, including 97,000 people right here in the Hawkeye State.\nMike Pence: (22:43)\nWe’ve got a great American comeback underway. We’re not just opening up America. We’re opening up America’s schools and getting our kids back in the classroom. Those tests I just told you about, we’re distributing 100 million of those. We’re sending them out pro rata to every state in the country to make it possible for school nurses and school systems to get our kids back in the classroom and to keep them back in the classroom.\nMike Pence: (23:09)\nIt’s just extraordinary, and I’m proud to report to you that I’ve been married to a school teacher for 35 years. She’s already back in the classroom in a little Christian school just outside Washington.\nMike Pence: (23:24)\nSo we’ve gone through a time of testing, but I’m here in Iowa today because in 33 days, we’re coming to a time for choosing. The choice in this election has never been clearer. The stakes have never been higher. I mean, think about it. In the middle of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. President Trump, we not only cut taxes across the board in our first three years, but we’re going to keep cutting taxes for four more years.\nMike Pence: (23:58)\nJoe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape. It seemed the other night that he didn’t even know that he endorsed the Green New Deal. Next day, he got off a train and said, “Green New Deal is a good plan, but our Green New Deal is a little different.” I’m telling you what. Both versions are job killers. I mean, you all understand the enormous cost on our economy that any one of those versions would impose. We’ve been cutting red tape, freeing up companies just like this one to create jobs and opportunity, and we’re going to keep cutting red tape for four more years. That’s how you bring the economy back.\nMike Pence: (24:43)\nJoe Biden’s for open borders, sanctuary cities, free healthcare for illegal immigrants. President Donald Trump made record investments in border security. Mexico is now doing more to secure their southern border and ours than ever before, and we’ve already built 300 miles of that wall on the southern border of the United States. With four more years, we’re going to fix this broken immigration system once and for all.\nMike Pence: (25:14)\nWhen it comes to trade, the contrast could not be more clear. Out here in the Heartland, we saw the impact, particularly in manufacturing that NAFTA had since 1995. There were entire communities in Indiana where auto plants were shuttered, thousands of people put out of work virtually overnight as jobs were shipped south of the border. In all his 47 years and ever since NAFTA was enacted, Joe Biden never lifted a finger to reform it or renegotiate it. But thanks to the man who wrote The Art of the Deal, America’s got a better deal than NAFTA. The United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land, and it’s a win for American manufacturing and a win for American farmers. If you didn’t know, I’m told nearly half of Iowa’s exports actually go to Canada and Mexico. So it’s a huge win for Iowa. It’s incredible. Experts estimate that we’re going to sell another $2 billion more in agricultural goods to Canada and Mexico, and that includes more than 300 million in dairy exports alone. It’s a huge win for the Heartland. It’s a huge win for farmers.\nMike Pence: (26:26)\nSo when it comes to jobs and trade, when we came into office, fully half of our international trade deficit was with one country, the People’s Republic of China. Communist China represented $500 billion of our annual trade deficit. Now, Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China. He actually said it was a positive thing to see the rise of China, to see it admitted to the world Trade Organization. President Trump, he put China on notice from day one that the era of economic surrender is over.\nMike Pence: (27:04)\nThis president stood strong. We imposed tariffs on China. When China started to retaliate against American farmers, we made more than $15 billion in direct support available to farmers from what we were collecting in those tariffs. Now, believe it or not, Joe Biden actually wants to repeal all the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to level the playing field for American workers, but we’re not going to let it happen. With four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, we’re going to stand strong with China until they open their markets and respect American jobs and American workers.\nMike Pence: (27:53)\nI promise you, men and women, we’ve made incredible progress in security and in prosperity. But the choice that we face in this election is also about our most cherished values, and Joe Biden and the Democratic Party support abortion on demand. Joe Biden actually supports using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth. My part, I couldn’t be more proud to be Vice President to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history. That’s true.\nMike Pence: (28:48)\nWhen you look at their agenda, when you look at their agenda, one thing is clear. Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. Joe Biden said in his convention speech that democracy was on the ballot on November the 3rd. Well, I think our economic recovery is on the ballot. Law and order are on the ballot. But I also think there are things much more fundamental and foundational to our country. You heard Ben Carson reflect on it. You heard David Young reflect on it.\nMike Pence: (29:22)\nI mean, I honestly would tell you I don’t think when the dust settles in this election it’s going to be whether America becomes more Republican or more Democrat, whether we’re more liberal or more conservative, more red or more blue. I think the choice in this election is whether America remains America, whether we’re going to continue to chart a course based upon freedom and our highest ideals and our most cherished liberties and values, whether we’re going to let Joe Biden and the Democratic Party and the radical left take us on a completely different-\nMike Pence: (30:03)\n… Democratic Party and the radical left take us on a completely different path, to a place America has never been before. That’s why, men and women of Iowa, we’ve got to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States of America. We’re going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. It’s going to take all of us. And you all from Nebraska need to go to work too. You got to bring this enthusiasm. You got 33 days to go. I promise you, as I said at the top, we’re going to keep fighting every single day. I’m going to be in Salt Lake City next Wednesday night. We’re going to do our best to take our case one more time to the American people and take the fight to the Biden-Harris agenda.\nMike Pence: (31:07)\nBut we need you to go out and tell your neighbors and friends what four more years means. I mean, just tell them. Say, “I ran into Mike over at PBS, and he’s talking about everything that we’d done in the first three years, the president’s leadership through this challenging time, this great American comeback that’s underway. But he was just excited about what we could do with four more years. I mean, four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means more support for our troops.” And you tell him, I said, it’s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp. Oh, we’ll drain it. Man.\nSpeaker 1: (31:58)\nFour more years.\nMike Pence: (32:04)\nI love her enthusiasm. Thank you for that. Thank you for being here today. I just encourage you to leave here today with renewed faith. Well, you turn on the television anymore and not that anything different the last three and a half years. With one network exception, it’s been ongoing negativity, ongoing criticism. Right? But this president has turned his face like flint against the wind every day. And I can tell you firsthand, my friend, your president has never stopped fighting to keep the promises he made to the people of Iowa and Nebraska. Now, it’s your turn to fight for him. It’s on.\nMike Pence: (32:55)\nSo, go tell your neighbors and friends at worship and at work all that we talked about here today. And tell him that the road to victory rolls right through Iowa, rolls right through Nebraska. And do your part to make sure and elect those great allies and reelect those great allies who made it possible for us to move our nation forward as we have in all these days. And, if you’re of a mind to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, over the next 33 days, I encourage you to do that too.\nSpeaker 1: (33:26)\n[inaudible 00:33:30].\nMike Pence: (33:28)\nBecause I love that ancient verse, ” If his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray,” he’ll do like he’s always done throughout much more challenging times in the life of our nation. The good book tells us words that we want to hear today. You’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land, this one nation under God with Liberty and justice for all.\nMike Pence: (34:15)\nSo, thank you again. This has been great fun. I look forward to a quick hello before I slip away. I’m off to Des Moines and then back to Washington. But I leave here with renewed confidence. I really do. A pastor friend of mine said one time, “Everybody is under encouraged.” You’ve been an encouragement to me. And I can’t wait to tell the president about the enthusiasm I saw here at Carter Lake. And I just know, if you’ll carry this same enthusiasm all across Iowa and all across Nebraska in the next 33 days, if you work like it all depends on us, and you pray to him on whom it does depend, I know we’re going to make Iowa and Nebraska more prosperous than ever before. We’re going to make Iowa and Nebraska safer than ever before.\nMike Pence: (35:05)\nAnd with David Young, Ashley Henson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Randy Feenstra, and Nebraska’s own Don Bacon, and a new Republican majority in the Congress, with Senator Joni Ernst in a renewed Republican majority in the United States Senate, with president Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, and with God’s grace, we’re going to make America great again, again. Thank you very much. God bless you and God bless America.",

         "Speaker 1: (01:52)\n( Singing).\nDonald Trump: (01:52)\nHello, everybody. Hello, Duluth. Hello, Duluth. Thank you. Thirty-four days from now, we’re going to win Minnesota. We’re going to go and win four more beautiful years in the White House and do more than anybody’s ever done before from the White House. We’re looking to set records. I really enjoyed last night’s debate with Sleepy Joe. I brought those hats out here because Minnesota is a little on the windy side. Like a genius, I sent them all out, and I’m getting blown to fishes, then that’s fine. That’s okay. I love it. I love you to have whatever we have. We have it together, that I can tell you.\nDonald Trump: (02:34)\nThe verdict is in and they say that we, we, all of us, won big last night. I don’t know. Did you hear about this? In the history of cable television, it had the highest ratings of any show in the history of cable television. It had the second highest ratings of overall television in the history of television. Does anybody know what was first? Like M*A*S*H or something? I guess M*A*S*H, they had the final episode of M*A*S*H, and I don’t know what was first. Does anybody know? But we were second in the history of all of television, but the biggest ratings in the history of cable television. It’s an honor.\nDonald Trump: (03:16)\nLast night, I did want the corrupt media has refused to do. I held Joe Biden accountable for his 47 years of lie, 47 years of betrayal, and 47 years of failure. I held Joe accountable for shipping your jobs and dreams abroad, and for bowing to the violent mob at home. Can you imagine these people the way they take over these Democrats cities? I don’t even believe it. The whole nation saw the truth. Did you see last night, name one, I said, “Sleepy Joe, name one law enforcement group that supports you.” Then, Chris Wallace says, “Don’t do that.” Can you believe this guy? I was debating two people last night.\nDonald Trump: (03:57)\nI was debating two people last night. Joe Biden is too weak to lead this country. You know Biden lost badly when his supporters are saying he should cancel the rest of the debates. Now, I understand he’s canceling the debates. Let’s see what happens. I think that’s not going to be a good move. I don’t think that’s going to be a good move. Television, with those ratings, they’re never going to let them cancel. You don’t know television like that. What are they going to do? Someday, we’re not going to be doing this anymore. What are they going to do without Trump? What are they going to do?\nDonald Trump: (04:31)\nThose poor people. Look at all of them, whoa. That’s a lot of people. What are they going to do? What are they going to do when in eight, 12, maybe 16 years, I said, “Let’s hang it up. Let’s hang it up.” 16 more years. But what he’s doing is what you do when you lose. So, let’s see what he does. I don’t think he’s going to get that. I’ve got news for Joe. If you ever became president, you have to deal with some of the toughest people in the world, and Chris Wallace is very, very easy by comparison. I will tell you. I know him. I know him well.\nDonald Trump: (05:14)\nLiberal media is upset that I took the fight to Biden and exposed his very dangerous agenda. There’s a beauty. Here we go. Here we go. There’s another beauty out there. Go home to mom. Go home. Go home to mom. These are the same media outlets cheering violent demonstrations in the streets, CNN, the New York Times. They think rioting is just, “Okay, just do whatever you want.” You can do whatever you want. You don’t have to wear a mask. You just riot, 25,000 people standing on each other’s face. Do whatever you want. Can you go to church? No.\nDonald Trump: (06:00)\nCan you go to restaurants? No. Can you do anything? No, but you can riot. That’s okay. Arson’s okay, but challenging Sleepy Joe is totally off limits. So, disappointed in Fox. I’m not just running against Joe Biden. I’m running against the corrupt far-left media, socialists, and communists, and the Democrat Party, and the special interests who’ve made a living bleeding our country dry. That’s what’s happened for too long. We’ve turned it around, but don’t forget when they turned it around, I had to fight other things like a fake impeachment.\nDonald Trump: (06:34)\nI had to fight a lot of things that are not like it wasn’t in the agenda. Never forget that we fought it very well, and frankly, we had great support from the Republican Party except for one person, but that’s all right. We had great support. Never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and that’s true. This is a choice election. Our opponents put America last. I put America first, and that’s what I’ve been doing for three and a half years. Our opponents want to erase borders. I will defend our borders.\nDonald Trump: (07:16)\nYou see what’s going on in the southern border. By the way, that wall, 350 miles already, got to be finished very soon. They don’t talk about the wall anymore, fellas. What’s going on? They don’t talk about it. They used to talk about it every day, “He’s not going to get his financing.” But when you’re a real estate developer, you always get financing. This was easy. “He’s not going to get his financing.” Then, we got our finance, they don’t talk about it anymore. We’re up to 300, almost 360 miles. We’re doing about 10 miles a week. Yeah, Mexico is paying for it. You do know that, right?\nDonald Trump: (07:50)\nThey keep saying, “There’s going to be a border charge at the border for the trucks and cars.” It won’t even have to be a lot. There’s so many cars and trucks going through, but Mexico is paying for it and they’ve been great. They have 27,000 soldiers right now on our border, and we appreciate it. We appreciate the President of Mexico. Our opponents will send your jobs to China. I will keep your jobs in America. Our opponents want to erase our nation’s core value, and I want to defend, preserve our nation’s historic values. Our opponents stand with rioters. I stand with the heroes of law enforcement. Did you see last night? I said, “Say the words, don’t even say good or bad. Sleepy Joe, say law enforcement.” He goes, “No, I’d rather not.” “Say law enforcement, Sleepy Joe.” “Law enforcement with safety.” “No, no, no. Just law enforcement.” They tell me that all time, too, please just say law enforcement with safety. No, it’s just law enforcement. It’s very simple. It’s a very simple term. Not with safety, unsafety. It’s law enforcement. He wouldn’t say it. Then, I said, “Name one group in the entire nation,” I’ve got Minnesota now, I’ve got everybody, “name one group in the entire nation from law enforcement that’s supporting you.”\nDonald Trump: (09:22)\nWell, well, well, thank Chris Wallace, “Okay. let’s go to the next question. He’s in trouble. He’s in trouble. Let me protect him for Fox.” Joe Biden says, antifa is just an idea. Well, ideas don’t assault cops and they don’t burn down buildings. Antifa is a domestic terrorist organization. I proudly received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, and law enforcement organizations and departments in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota. Good.\nDonald Trump: (10:17)\nI was getting worried. Texas, New York’s finest. They’d never done it before. They came in New York’s finest, you see great people, they could solve that problem in two minutes. All they want is their authority back. It’s been taken away from them, horribly. New York’s finest never endorsed a candidate for president before, and they’re great people. They can do it. New Jersey, Illinois, and many, many more. I won’t bore you, but I could go on and on that. I just said, “Joe, give me one, please.” He was joking. I’ll tell you, he got saved. Joe Biden is saying he owns the socialism and extremism in his party, that he owns it.\nDonald Trump: (10:56)\nYou know it’s not his party. It’s not Joe’s party. You got crazy Bernie, you have AOC plus three, you got all these crazy people, these maniacs, you have the green new deal. How about the green new deal? He disavowed it. Then, he said, “No, I agree with it.” I said, “Joe, it’s a hundred trillion dollars. That’s more money than this country can make in the next hundred years if everything’s perfect.” It’s so crazy. He wants to rebuild every building. Take it down and rebuild every building. Let’s see, does that include the Empire State? Well, let’s take it down and rebuild it. These people are crazy. No, more cows, no more airplanes, no more nothing.\nDonald Trump: (11:36)\nBiden even vowed to eliminate our tax cuts. That means he’ll take away your child tax credits, because I gave you child tax credits, a thousand dollars a child. He wants to take away what I gave you and revoke our historic tax relief, right to the middle-class it went. Joe Biden also refused to answer questions about packing the Supreme Court. Don’t you love the Supreme Court? How good is Amy? How good is Amy? How good is Amy? Her professor at Notre Dame, one of the most highly respected … Fill that seat, fill that seat. You better believe it. How good is she? So, her professor, one of her professors, one of the most highly respected legal scholars in the country said, “I’ve been teaching for a long time,” said, “she is the finest.”\nDonald Trump: (12:33)\nShe was first in her class, graduated first in her class. He said she is the finest student he’s ever had. Of all the students, thousands of students, she’s the single best student that he’s ever had. You know what I’m saying? She would have run for president instead of Joe. He was like last in his class. Can you imagine? This is a big difference. I don’t know. How do you like Amy for the Supreme Court? Yes? If he gets elected, the hard left will appoint radical justice-\nDonald Trump: (13:03)\nIf he gets elected, the hard left will appoint radical justices who will terminate the second amendment. No more guns. No more guns. As you all saw, Biden also refused to explain why his son Hunter was paid $3.5 billion protected by Chris, by the wife of the former mayor of Moscow. And they talk about me with Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. And took out $1.5 billion from China. He manages, makes millions of dollars a year. Right? Then he got the 183. Right? $183,000 a month. Would anybody like that job? You don’t have a job. You’re not employed. You get thrown out of the military for unfortunate reasons. Your father becomes vice-president and you get hired for $183,000 a month with I think a $3 million upfront payment. I think they could have had him for less. Would anybody take that job?\nDonald Trump: (13:57)\nAnd he knows nothing about energy. What do you know about energy? Well, that’s not my thing. Oh, that’s okay. I mean, could you imagine if I did it? How about when sleep Joe said, “You’re not getting the $1 billion unless you get rid of the prosecutor. When you get rid of the prosecutor we’ll send you the money.” They got rid of the prosecutor. He said, “Now the money comes.” I mean, can you imagine if I said that? Unbelievable. And the press doesn’t want to talk about it. And Chris Wallace is like, “We don’t want to discuss that.” Oh really, Chris? It’s so sad. I’ll tell you. It’s so hypocritical. So sad. This is a matter of national security and economic security. The Bidens got rich while American workers got robbed. How can you deal with China if you take out three and a half billion dollars and make all sorts of money? How can you do it?\nDonald Trump: (14:44)\nA critical issue in this election, you saw what I did with China, billions and billions a year, they pay us. I gave a lot of it to the farmers, $28 billion. A critical issue because they were targeted by China. A critical issue in this election is the future of the Minnesota Iron Range. You know what. That’s why I’m here. This was just supposed to be a little get together. And then they said, “Sir, we got thousands of people want to show up. I don’t know.” I don’t know how many are involved. This is the best to be an Iron Range get together. But it turns out big. Biden has 20, 30 people. He’s got those circles. Today he had a little bit more like 30 or 40, but they were too close together. I sent him a note to Joe. They were too close. 34 people right next to each other. And yet he complained about our rally, right? Our rallies.\nDonald Trump: (15:39)\nNow it’s an honor that so many people showed up because this was going to be a little quickie just to say congratulations because Obama closed the Iron Range and I opened it and a man came up to me, a tough man, a worker, a construction worker, real worker. And he looked at me, this is two years ago, he said, “Sir, you’ve given us back our life.” And he was crying. And I said, “When was the last time you cried?” He said, “I can’t remember.” I said, “You never cried when you were a little baby. You never cried.” This is not a crier. This guy was tough as hell. He said, “Sir, he took our life away.” And let me tell you about Joe. Joe will re-institute that ban in two minutes if we lose. So you better vote for me in Minnesota. Really, I mean honestly. He said, “You gave our lives back. A lot of lives. Thousands of jobs.” And they closed it up. As Vice President Joe Biden wiped out. He wiped out so much, and that includes what he wiped out in the great state of Minnesota. And we’re not going to let it happen anymore. We’re not going to let it happen anymore. Thousands and thousands of workers, we’re not going to let it happen anymore. They were all laid off and now they’re all back. By the way they say, what the hell do I know about iron ore? A lot of steel than a lot of iron over the years. But they say it’s the greatest iron ore anywhere in the world and you should have. After I put tariffs on foreign steel, the Iron Range came roaring back.\nDonald Trump: (17:28)\nBut the biggest thing I did was knock out his executive order. I’ve knocked out so much in the things that he did. He can’t like me too much. I would say he doesn’t like me too much. Hey, did you see what happened with the FBI today? They caught them cold. Comey either has the worst memory in history. I don’t remember that. Did you spy on President Trump’s campaign? “Gee, I don’t remember that.” “Did you go for a coup? Did you go for a coup?” ” I don’t remember. I don’t know.” I’ll tell you. We caught him cold. It’s about time that something happens. Okay. It’s about time that something happens. It’s enough. We got plenty of information in these crooks, bunch of crooks. A thing like that’s never happened in the history of our country, and it’s about time that something happens.\nDonald Trump: (18:21)\nWe rescinded the federal withdrawal in Superior National Forest. You’ll know all about that, you people especially, to restore mineral exploration for the iron ore miners in Minnesota. What we’ve done for Minnesota. I lose Minnesota, I’m never coming back. I don’t care. I’m never coming back. We’ve protected Iron Range workers from frivolous lawsuits. That was a big deal. Right? The frivolous lawsuits. We started construction on the Soo Lock to get iron ore to market very quickly. So not only did we open it, we get it to market. We fixed the locks because you couldn’t even get it out. Those things were so old and broken. Now they’re going to be very shortly in perfect shape.\nDonald Trump: (19:03)\nI opened up permitting for copper nickel, mining, anybody involved there? It sounded a little far out, but you got a lot of people doing that. I strongly support the replacement of the decaying Line 3 pipeline. We’re going to replace it. It’s all done. It’s all done. All of this is why nine Democrat mayors of cities in the Iron Range have endorsed me over sleepy Joe Biden. Are they here tonight? I don’t know if they’re here tonight. These people are fantastic. Look at these great congressmen. Where are they? Oh, stand up. Wow. We had a ceremony a month ago where I introduced every one of them. I’m not introducing you again. It’s freezing out here. But I want to thank you. You’re great people. Great mayors. I appreciate the support very much. These are Democrats that want to vote for Trump. That endorsed me fully. We’ve done a good job over there. Everything in good shape? Right? Thank you very much. It’s a great honor.\nDonald Trump: (20:17)\nIf Joe gets in, the radical left will shut down the Iron Range forever. It’s going to be gone. They’re not going to be able to open it again. Not easy to open a thing like that. Not easy. A lot more difficult than people would think. Earlier today, I took another historic step for your state when I signed an executive order, provided billions of dollars to jumpstart production of critical and other minerals, which will create countless jobs that are so important for our country. Minerals. I will always protect the state of Minnesota. I will do that. It’s been very good to me. We almost won it. We almost won it.\nDonald Trump: (20:56)\nOne more speech. I had a choice. Do I do Michigan, which we won? I should’ve done them both. One more speech. We lost by very little. Think of that though. Hasn’t been won by a Republican. I don’t get that because the Democrats have done such a lousy pathetic job. Hasn’t been one since 1972. Reagan lost. It was the only state he lost. Remember? So we’re going to change that. We’ve got to change it. Who’s going to do what we’ve done for you? Right?\nDonald Trump: (21:26)\nAnother massive issue for Minnesota is the election of Joe Biden’s plan to inundate your state with a historic flood of refugees. Biden and crazy Bernie Sanders have agreed on a manifesto. Did you see last night? I didn’t agree. I [inaudible 00:21:47] show and they said, “Oh, actually he did.” Oh, great. They fact checked. They found out he made a mistake. Slight mistake. It’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen. But they pledged a 700% increase in refugees. 700%. Congratulations, Minnesota. Congratulations. And what about Omar where she gets caught harvesting? What the hell is going on? I hope your US attorney is involved. What is going on with Omar? I’ve been reading these reports for two years about how corrupted, crooked she is. Let’s get with it. Let’s get with it. I mean, frankly harvesting is terrible, but it’s the least of the things that she has done. How the hell… Then she tells us how to run our country. Can you believe it? How the hell did Minnesota elect her? What the hell is wrong with you people? Right? What the hell happened? These guys in the… Stand up. Are you a big fan of Omar? I don’t think so. Stand up. Look at this guy. It looks like nobody’s going to fight him. I don’t think you’re a big fan of Omar. Right? No, she’s been crooked for a long time. This is the least of it. It’s time. And you know what? AOC also. It’s time. It’s time. You take a look at the corruption, the disgusting corruption. 700% increase refugees coming from the most dangerous places in the world including Yemen, Syria, and your favorite country, Somalia, right? You love Somalia. This guy loves Somalia.\nDonald Trump: (23:26)\nBiden will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp. And he said that. Overwhelming public resources, overcrowding schools, and inundating your hospitals. You know that. It’s already there. It’s a disgrace what they’ve done to your state. It’s a disgrace. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban on jihadist regions, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. Remember I used to talk about it all the time? I got a ban. Remember they said he’d never be able to get a ban? And then I lost at the lower court. I lost at the court of appeals. And they said, “He lost, he lost.” [inaudible 00:24:03] then I won at the Supreme Court. They didn’t even report it. Yeah. They still say, “He lost on the travel ban. He lost, he lost.” But they’re talking about the first two courts. They forget to say that the Supreme court. This is the most [inaudible 00:24:18].\nDonald Trump: (24:17)\nIt’s hard to believe actually, but look at all those cameras. That’s a lot. They love it. Every time I’m getting ready, they’ve gotten very good at this, every time I’m getting ready to hit them, the lights just go off. You know those red lights? They go [inaudible 00:24:31]. My administration is keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals out of our country. And we’re keeping them the hell out of Minnesota. We’ve ended the refugee influx into your state. You were one of the most hard hit states for whatever reason. We’ve ended it. You know that, right? You know that. Does anybody know this? Does anybody know this? I don’t think they tell you about it. But they talk about the suburbs, women in the suburbs. I ended a regulation that nobody would have done. This brings public housing, low-income housing into the suburbs. By the way, just so we can get this right, 30% of the people in the suburbs are low income people. 30% of the people in the suburbs are minorities.\nDonald Trump: (25:16)\nSo we’re ruining this American dream for everybody, but he’s got a plan. It’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen having to do with zoning. They zone you out. They build low-income housing next to your house. It’s crazy. Then I hear I’m not doing well in the suburbs. I’m not doing well in the suburbs. Are you people crazy? Are you crazy? I just explained this. No, I just explained it. Thank you. No, it’s crazy. And they came to me, great people. Ben Carson, a lot of great people and they came to me and they said, “Sir, why don’t we just amend it?” I said, “No, really, I want it out. I want it over. I want it ended.” Well, it’d be a lot easier to amend it. I said, “No, I want it over. It’s not right. It’s killing your suburbs. And it is. It’s killing your suburbs.” And then they say women in the suburbs don’t like President Trump. I don’t think-\nDonald Trump: (26:03)\n“Women in the suburbs don’t like President Trump.” I don’t think so. That happened last time. Remember last time? They said, “He will not do well with women. He will not do well with women. He will not do well with women.” These were the idiots on election night four years ago, “He will not do… This will be a very short night for Donald Trump,” at the time. “This will be a very short,” and at the end they said, “He did really well with women.” It was sort of weird.\nDonald Trump: (26:33)\nAnyway, we did well with everybody, actually, and we’re going to do even better now. We have more… Look at this crowd, this was supposed to be a few people. This was supposed to be just a little celebration. I said, “Oh, good. A little celebration.” I figured a couple of hundred people like Sleepy Joe gets it his best day. I said, “How many people?” “About 10,000, Sir.” I said, “Oh, that’s nice.”\nDonald Trump: (27:02)\nIn just three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s border, rebuilt awesome power of the US military, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and they were a disaster, and brought jobs back home to America. And back home to Minnesota, we brought a lot of jobs back.\nDonald Trump: (27:26)\nLast year before the plague came in from China, you had the best year you’ve ever had. The year before that, you had the best year you’ve ever had until the following year, and we’re doing it again, we’re building it up rapidly. China came up, they gave us the plague, it’s no good, we’re never going to forget that. I did a trade deal, the ink wasn’t even dry, and they let that happen. We’re never going to forget it.\nDonald Trump: (27:46)\nWe built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we are quickly doing it again. We’ve added a historic 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. That’s a record the likes of which has never even been close to being challenged. To fight the China virus, we launched the largest national mobilization since world war II, we pioneered lifesaving therapies reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that, meaning you go to the hospital and you got a lot better chance.\nDonald Trump: (28:21)\nI’ll tell you what. I spoke to a gentleman today from Pfizer. I speak to all of these guys, these are great people, and they’re coming up with things that are phenomenal, Regeneron, we are coming up with things that are phenomenal, including therapeutics for therapies. It’s incredible what’s happening. You’ll be seeing it very… And By the way with Biden, it would have been years before you came up with any of this stuff. Years, it would have been years.\nDonald Trump: (28:46)\nHe complains, “You did not fast enough.” And yet he’s all over the place calling me xenophobic because I closed the border. Okay, how do you figure that one? This guy, just a politician. He’s just another politician. 47 years he hasn’t done a damn thing, but now he’s going to. “I haven’t done anything in 47 years, but now I’m going to.”\nDonald Trump: (29:08)\nEurope is almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States, you don’t hear that. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will develop and distribute a vaccine in record time, it’s going to be very, very soon. And before the end of the year, maybe sooner than that. On November 3rd, Minnesota will decide whether we end this pandemic, defeat the virus, and return to record prosperity. Either way, we’re returning, either way. We’re going to have the vaccine. We’re [inaudible 00:03:38].\nDonald Trump: (29:39)\nWell, whether we allow Joe Biden to kill the recovery… He wants to shut down. This guy says, “Let’s shut it down.” A lot of deaths caused by shutdown; depression, death, drugs, alcoholism, horrendous family fights, horrendous family fights, and he wants to destroy those suburbs by abolishing single family zoning. All of these things are just a horrible thing, what he wants to do. And I think he’s going to do it because he’s not smart enough to understand that the other side has big problems.\nDonald Trump: (30:10)\nYou know, we did something great. We had the greatest economy in history and we had to close it down because we would have lost millions of lives, and now we’re opening it up and we’re doing it at a level like nobody’s ever seen before, and it’s a great thing, and we’re going to be back in business very soon, except for some Democrats.\nDonald Trump: (30:28)\nAnd they’ll all open up. They’re going to all open up right after November 3rd. They’ll announce, “We’d like to tell you that we’re all opening up November 4th.” Did you see the one group that said, “We’re opening up right after the election, I think we’ll open up.” That’s great.\nDonald Trump: (30:42)\nThese are terrible people because they’re more interested in politics than they are in the lives of people. They want to confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children to this poisonous anti-American rhetoric and lies. To combat the toxic left… And you see this, that toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called the 1776 Commission.\nDonald Trump: (31:13)\nWe will teach our children the truth about America that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. That’s what I want them to hear. We are joined tonight by some real warriors, friends of mine. They fight with… they just win, they know how to win. I’m telling you, you have some great ones and they really are, they’re great people. The impeachment hoax, they fought it so great. These are real warriors. I call them warriors.\nDonald Trump: (31:41)\nRepresentatives Tom Emmer, Jim Hagedorn and Pete Stauber, great hockey player. And I’ll tell you, we have some incredible congressional candidates that we’re going to work because we got to get Nancy Pelosi the hell out of there, and we’re very [inaudible 00:32:10]. We have some candidates; Tyler Kistner, where’s Tyler? Thank you, Tyler. Great job. I hear great things, Tyler.\nDonald Trump: (32:21)\nA man with the greatest name in politics, Lacy Johnson, great guy, great guy. And somebody who’s going to help us a lot along with Tyler, Lacy, Michelle Fischbach. Thank you Michelle. Thank you. We’re going to be working with you, and they all have my total endorsement, you know that. Okay?\nDonald Trump: (32:46)\nThe next US Senator from Minnesota is a man who was born for this position unlike your current Senator, who nobody knows who the hell she is. I said, who is she? Is she in the Senate? Jason Lewis. Thank you, Jason. Great job you’re doing. We got to get Jason in, got to get them all in. RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. Thank you, Tommy. And Mike Lindell, he makes more pillows this guy. He makes more pillows, thank you Mike. He goes to a lot of my rallies, he likes these rallies, and we like him. Here as well tonight is 96-year-old world war II veteran, Dr. John [Ringsred 00:07:35]. Look at you. You look great, John. Wow. You look good. Handsome. Thank you, John. Thank you very much. It’s an honor, john. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. In 2017, I signed a very historic executive order making it difficult and really just looking at what government policy has to do in order to buy American and hire American. You ever see Biden? He’s got a sign, buy American. I said he got it from me. I’ve been doing this for a long time. Copies my campaign, copies our plans. He copies a lot, like you haven’t heard that before.\nDonald Trump: (34:33)\nHe invested $2.5 trillion in the military, we put 2.5 trillion in. We have the best weapons, all made in the USA. We have the greatest weaponry we’ve ever had. No country has ever come close to the kind of firepower we have. Hope to God we never have to use it. We have firepower and weapons and the Republicans said it because Democrats… We have to have that, otherwise we’re going to be at the mercy of other countries. We have the greatest firepower, the greatest weapons in the history of the world. Hope to God that we never have to use them.\nDonald Trump: (35:08)\nAnd we launched a new branch of the US armed forces, first since the air force in 75 years, it’s called the space force. That’s a big deal. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi gone. We took out the world’s number one terrorist, and the murderer of so many American troops and plenty of other troops, Qasem Soleimani is no longer with us.\nDonald Trump: (35:42)\nI withdrew from the last administration’s total disaster, the Iran Nuclear Deal. Obama gave them 150 billion. That was bad, but he gave him 1.8 billion in cash. How the hell do you do that? What does 1.8 billion in cash look like? They must have looked at that, they said, “Man, plane loads of cash.”\nDonald Trump: (36:03)\nI kept my promise recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and instead of endless wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. And I was nominated for three Nobel Prizes and I didn’t get one story. I have to tell you, because they refuse to write it.\nDonald Trump: (36:36)\nWhen Obama got his Nobel Prize, it was the biggest story I’ve ever seen. And he didn’t even know why he got it. He got it like immediately upon taking office. [inaudible 00:36:46] but I told my first lady, I told our first lady, “Darling, you’re going to be so proud of me tonight. We’re going to watch television and you’re not going to believe how big this [inaudible 00:10:54]” “What happened? What happened?” “Darling, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for Israel, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates. And then I was nominated again for Serbia, Kosovo, all different. Then I was nominated a third time.” But I said, “First time, second time, I was a little bit.”\nAudience: (37:20)\nWe love you. We love you. We love you.\nDonald Trump: (37:20)\nYeah, I know. I love you too. But I said to our First Lady, “Watch this tonight, Darling, it’s going to be.” And I turn to Lester Holt, number two show. I turn to Lester Holt, and they covered one story was about rain, another was about the environment, another was about something else, another, it was a bad hit on me, another one, something else. So now we’re through with about half of it. Now they went to the longest commercial I’ve ever seen.\nDonald Trump: (37:50)\nNot supposed to, when you report the fake news, you’re not supposed to get free air time from the US government. Does anybody know what that means? And then they went onto the second half again and again and again, she looked at me, “Darling, I don’t think they’re going to cover this.” I said, “It’s impossible. It’s a nomination for the Nobel Peace award. It’s impossible.” Guess what? It ended, we got nothing. Then three days later we got nothing. And on the third time, the third time I said, “Let’s not even watch. We’re not getting anything. These people are sick.”\nDonald Trump: (38:23)\nBut I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. And now he’s pushing the most far-left platform in history, the Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for people with preexisting conditions, give free federal healthcare to all illegal aliens, bankrupting Medicare.\nDonald Trump: (38:49)\nBut you know, it’s going to happen. They’re going to pour into our country. When they hear that, they’re going to come in. They’re very smart, very sophisticated, you’d be surprised. Ban school choice and ban all charter schools. No more charter schools, no more school choice. Well, we’re making a lot of progress-\nDonald Trump: (39:03)\nThere’s no more charter schools, no more school choice but we’re making a lot of progress. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. Did you see what he said last night about manufacturing? Well, Obama said we’re not going to ever have manufacturing and you’d need a magic wand. Last night he said we’re doing manufacturing. No, no. They gave up on manufacturing. I have almost 700,000 manufacturing jobs. I said, “How can you lose manufacturing?” He’s bad news. They lie.\nDonald Trump: (39:51)\nWe will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police, increase penalties on assaults. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out, we will keep people out of our country. Thank you. But we will keep out of these ridiculous, endless Wars in countries that you’ve never heard of and you never will hear of. It’s ridiculous. And we’re bringing them all home. You see that. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. Ridiculous. We’re all over the world. We’re in places nobody ever heard of before.\nDonald Trump: (40:55)\nWe will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. I’ve already signed it. Can you believe it? It kicks in on January 1st. Can you imagine if this clown gets in? And they’ll say, “He got price transparency. What’s that?” That’ll have such an impact. It kicks in. I said to my people, “You think you could have kicked it in a little bit earlier?” And further reduced health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, which we’re going to be bringing down massively because of Favorite Nations. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect those incredible people, as I said, with pre-existing conditions.\nDonald Trump: (41:32)\nAmerica will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And it will be soon. You have to see. NASA has become again the greatest space center in the world. You had to see what it looked like when I took over. It was terrible. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust.\nDonald Trump: (42:25)\nFor years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Minnesota. Thank you. But if we don’t win, I’m never calling you great again. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, and get you co-workers and get out and vote. We got to win. We got to win.\nDonald Trump: (42:58)\nEarly voting has already begun. Don’t wait. Please go out and vote. Did you see in New York today? A hundred thousand fraudulent ballots. They send out a hundred thousand ballots. Wrong names, wrong addresses, wrong envelopes. Other than that, that did quite well. Think of it, a hundred thousand. So you know what this solution? That’s okay. We’ll send out another a hundred thousand. I said, “Really? What’s going to happen to the first hundred thousand. Who’s going to vote them?” This is crazy what’s going on. This is crazy. From St. Paul to St. Cloud, from Minneapolis to Minnetonka, and from Rochester to right here in Duluth. I like Duluth.\nDonald Trump: (43:42)\nThis great state was pioneered by men and women who brave the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families. They were truly brave, brilliant, incredible people. They were tough and they were strong. They didn’t have a lot of money. They didn’t have a lot of luxury, but they had grit, they had faith and they had each other. They were miners and lumberjacks, fishermen and farmers, shipbuilders and shopkeepers, but they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their country and they loved their God. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We’re going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. It’s true. We’re to keep on winning. You know, Minnesota, maybe I’ll just do a [inaudible 00:45:12] because we need Jason. Jason. Where’s Jason? Jason’s going to come. Jason Lewis. He’s going to be your Senator. You’re going to win so much. You know that one, right? You’ve heard it. Should I do it or not? I’ve got this beautiful crescendo of a speech and now I have to ruin it with this story with Jason, but let’s do it anyway.\nDonald Trump: (45:29)\nBut we’re going to win so much because Minnesota before I came around was not doing too well. Okay? Was not doing too well. Then you had your best years ever. But we’re going to win so much and you’re going to go and see your great Senator, Jason Lewis. He’s going to say. And you’re going to see Emmer, and you’re going to see all of that. And you’re going to say, Mr. Senator, please go see the President. We’re winning too much. We can’t stand it, sir. Minnesota, we’re not used to winning this much. It’s too much, sir. Please, go see. Well, I don’t want to do that. Please Senator. Go see the President. We’re winning too much. We cannot stand it. For years we’ve done poorly before he came along. Now we’re doing so well. And we’re growing now stronger than ever before. We don’t want to win so much, Mr. Senator.\nDonald Trump: (46:15)\nSo your Senator is going to come in. “Hi Jason, how are you doing?” “Sir, Minnesota is winning too much. We have to stop it.” I said, “What are you talking about?” “Sir, we have to stop it. It’s just too much running. We have to stop it.” I say, “Jason, let me tell you. I know the people of Minnesota and they love winning. They’re going to keep winning. We’re going to win. We’re going to win so much. We’re going to keep on winning. And you’re going to have the greatest year that you’ve ever had next year and the year after. And that’s where it’s heading. So I just want to thank you, and Jason, I’m sorry. I will not follow your wish.” Thank you very much.\nDonald Trump: (46:50)\nBut we are. We’re one movement. We’re one family. We’re one beautiful people in one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of Minnesota, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Go out and vote.\nDonald Trump: (48:09)\n(singing)",

         "Jill Biden: (00:00)\n… still beats with kindness and courage. We don’t agree on everything and we know we don’t have to. We can still love and respect each other. We care more about people than politics. And we know we’re not fractured. We’re not broken. We’re just becoming something new. We just need steady leadership, to help us heal and move us forward. And didn’t you see that last night in the debate against Donald Trump? That’s my husband, Joe Biden, that steady, calm leader. He will be a president for all Americans and he has a plan for all Americans. He and Kamala Harris have the fortitude to lead us out of Donald Trump’s chaotic America. They have the character to help us heal, and the vision to rebuild for a future that is better than ever.\nJill Biden: (01:09)\nBut they can’t do it without you, because this is it, guys. This is it. There are no do-overs. We can’t sit back and just watch what happens. We have to decide what happens. Thank you. Cynics plague our fears. They tell us we can’t make a difference, because they don’t want us to try. They know that together, our voices are more powerful than they ever could be. And we have to show them our power. We have to believe that our communities are stronger than the challenges that we face, because you are. We have to believe that our votes matter because they do. We have to show up, right now, put our shoulders back and work like we’ve never worked before and fight for our country.\nJill Biden: (02:10)\nSo will you join us? Will you prove the cynics wrong? Will you help show us that our nation will never settle for less than our highest aspirations? Will you stand with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? Because when you do, Pennsylvania, I know that we will win. So thank you for all that you do for your communities. Thank you for showing up now, when it matters the most. And most of all, thank you for your faith in an idea that’s bigger than any one of us. And that is, that we will build a better nation because we’re going to do this together. So thank you, Pennsylvania.\nCrowd: (02:59)\nThank you, Jill.\nJill Biden: (03:03)\nSo now, I think I’m supposed to introduce my husband. So, Joe, where are you. Oh, no I’m not? [crosstalk 00:03:21] Oh, okay. Maybe somebody else is. Thank you.\nCrowd: (03:38)\nThank you Jill. [crosstalk 00:03:38]\nSpeaker 1: (04:03)\nPlease welcome Brian Smith, a maintenance worker at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.\nBrian Smith: (04:20)\nGood evening. I’m Brian Smith, born and raised here in Johnstown, a place I’m proud to call home. I’m a proud union maintenance tech at the University of Pittsburgh Johnstown for the last 20 years. Right on. I’m even more proud to represent our SEIU 32BJ members, on the job as a shop steward. My good union job has made me raising my family in the place that I love, where my family is. And possible, when I come home from six years active duty service with the Navy Seabees, at the end of the first Gulf war, I worked construction jobs. I was fortunate to find a union job in the local foundry as a steelworker.\nBrian Smith: (05:03)\nWhen the street left our area and those living wage, family, feeding middle-class jobs left our area, I wasn’t sure if we’d be able to make it on the social service jobs that were available. I felt so fortunate to find union work at UPJ, doing the work I love, in carpentry, electrical and plumbing. The wages and benefits provided by this job allow my wife and I stay here and grow our family, with the healthcare and medical leave that we needed to keep our family healthy and to be caregivers for my aging parents. Because of my good union job, our son graduated from UPJ and our daughter’s in her sophomore year. A benefit that not only provided their tuition, but will impact their success and earning potential throughout their lives.\nBrian Smith: (05:50)\nI’m proud to serve my members on the job every day and I’m proud of my wife’s and my military service. We come from a long family history of military reserves. We have the strongest military in the world, because we understand that our military is only as strong as our weakest link. The same goes for our unions, brothers and sisters. And we need a Commander in Chief that will strive that unity and strengthen our country, instead of creating division, only weakening our collective power. I know who will be that leader for working people and that is Vice President Biden. And I say welcome, to the great city of Johnstown. Thank you. (silence)\nVice President Joe Biden: (07:16)\nLove Johnstown. It’s good to be back. It’s good to be back. Well, thank you. I tell you what, I first came to Johnstown and it was all Democrat. And guess what? Johnstown and this county’s going to be Democrat again after this election. [crosstalk 00:07:38] It’s good to be back, man. I’ll tell you what. It’s been an incredible day. We started this morning in Cleveland, Ohio, where just last night I had a truly unique experience of debating whatever his name was, Donald Trump.\nCrowd: (08:02)\nBoo.\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:02)\nOh, man.\nCrowd: (08:06)\nHow was that, Joe?\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:06)\nAnd from there, we’ve been to communities all across Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. We’re finishing up right here in Johnstown tonight. I want to thank the lieutenant governor, for being here. We call lieutenant governor’s wife [inaudible 00:08:20] governor. So, governor, thanks for being here and thank your wife as well and all the local elected officials and leaders for joining us today. And, Brian, thank you for your years of service and your wife’s service to our country, the United States Navy, and for sharing your stories with us. Last night, the President of the United States was reminded that he said that our veterans were losers and suckers.\nCrowd: (08:42)\nBoo.\nVice President Joe Biden: (09:35)\nNo, I’m serious about this. Like your family, my son spent a year in Iraq. It’s about ready. That’s a good thing. It’s still running. That’s a good thing. But wait, he came back decorated with the Bronze Star and the Conspicuous Service Medal. I thought it was despicable, that Donald Trump referred to everyone, from my friend and colleague and my competitor, John McCain, straight through to my son and others. It’s despicable. The man doesn’t deserve to be Commander in Chief of the world’s best military. But I want to thank the good people at Amtrak, who’ve been keeping me moving today. Quite frankly, my whole career. I started by taking the train, when I got elected as a 29 year old kid, to the United States Senate.\nVice President Joe Biden: (10:20)\nI started going back and forth every single day, so I could be home in Wilmington every night with two young boys as a single dad after I lost my wife. Two hours each way, nearly 250 miles every day, so I could be there for breakfast with the boys. It wasn’t Ozzie and Harriet stuff, it was just sort of cornflakes. But at least I got to be there to play with my daughter, kiss them good morning, go home and kiss them goodnight. That train brought me back to my home base every single night, to my family. It kept me grounded. It kept me connected. It meant I always remembered what and who really mattered in my life. And riding that train all those miles every day, and I spent as the conductors informed me, over 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak.\nVice President Joe Biden: (11:21)\nThey said, “Biden, they named a station after you.” They should have named the whole damn road after me all those times. All kidding aside. But seriously, it’s a true story. I’d ride home at night after a debate with the United States Senate, about a fair tax policy, or about healthcare, or about unions that I was fighting for. And I look out… I really mean this. I look out like I did coming from Cleveland today. I look out at all those home I pass, those middle class neighborhoods like I was raised in. I was raised in, like a lot of you I expect, a three bedroom…\nVice President Joe Biden: (12:03)\nI was raised, like a lot of you I expect, in a three-bedroom home, split level house, four kids, mom, dad and a grandpop living with us. I tell you what, I wonder if you’re having the same conversation that my mom and dad had when we were growing up, sitting there, wondering, “Honey, we need four new tires on the car. We can’t afford it. We’ve got to wait another couple months before we can get them.” Who’s going tell them, we might not have the money to help them go back to the university this semester? Who’s going to say it? Maybe we’re going to have to worry about whether or not they’re turning the electricity off because we’re behind on our bill because of job change, or I lost my health insurance.\nVice President Joe Biden: (12:58)\nThose are conversations that people are having today. The fact of the matter is, the vast majority of people in the middle class, over 50% said if they got a bill for $400 and it was unexpected in one month, that they could either borrow money or sell something to pay it. I think about their struggles and their words. I think about their hopes and their dreams. I talked to the other passengers on the train, and I got pretty friendly with some of the conductors. I learned about their lives and their families. It was a constant reminder that every single person has their own unique story, their own journey. In my experience, everyone is just looking for a chance. It’s not a guarantee. It’s a chance to get ahead, just a fair shot, an equal opportunity to pursue their dreams.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:06)\nThat dream gets further and further out of reach for so many folks here in Johnstown, my hometown of Scranton, Claymont where I was raised. It’s getting harder and harder. That’s what I’ve seen today at every stop on that train, from the folks who join me on this trip. I’ve spent time with a dedicated school elementary teacher from Lawrencetown, Ohio, who spoke about how the GM Plant … Remember, the President said, “Don’t sell your homes. Everything’s going to be okay in Lawrencetown. Everything’s going to stay.” That GM plant closed and guess what? It devastated the whole community. About how her own husband had to accept a transfer to a plant in Kentucky, an eighth-hour drive each way, only home on the weekends, just in order to maintain his healthcare and his pension. Now, he drives 16 hours every weekend, just to see her and the kids.\nVice President Joe Biden: (15:08)\nI listened to an incredible young woman, a mother of four at home, a heath aide and a nursing student. Talk about how worried she is that no one is looking out for the caregivers in this country, the people who, so many of them have literally risked and given their lives so that we’d be okay, especially during this pandemic. I saw steel workers and iron workers whose union brothers and sisters built Pittsburgh’s famous bridges, proud operating engineers who keep the engines of our economy pumping. I heard from union members who’ve gotten a raw deal so many times and so many more at every stop that I made, just hard working people like all of you, folks who played by the rules and paid their fair share their whole lives, folks who never asked for a single thing to be given to them, just a chance to earn it.\nVice President Joe Biden: (16:24)\nFolks, it couldn’t be a more stark difference from what I saw last night on that debate stage, a self-entitled, self-serving President who thinks everything is about him. He thinks that, if he just yells louder and louder, throws out lie after lie after lie, he’ll get his way. He thinks you’ll forget. Well, he picked the wrong guy. I don’t forget. I don’t forget that in February, he’s on tape acknowledging he knew how serious this pandemic was. He knew how quickly it would spread, that thousands of people would be killed, but he forgot to say a single thing. He kept it secret. He was more worried about the stock market collapsing than about the over 205,000 people who’ve died.\nVice President Joe Biden: (17:39)\nHe didn’t say a word. What did he tell us? He said it’d be gone by Easter. It will go away in the warm weather. He told us it will just go away like a miracle, and then maybe if we injected bleach in our arm, we may be okay. He thinks we’ll forget about how badly he mismanaged this pandemic that cost us more so far than 205,000 lives and counting, almost 30 million people on unemployment insurance. He thinks we’ll forget the reason our businesses and our schools are closed is because he took no responsibility. He’s a complete failure. He didn’t get the people the PPE, the resources they need to be able to reopen safely. He didn’t speak to you or the American people about the concerns. Not even once last night did he say a word about anything.\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:49)\nSeriously, think about it. Not once, because not only the trail of broken promises, lies he told communities like Johnstown and all across the industrial Midwest, it’s more than that. Just as I said last night, when he heard that 1,000 people a day were dying, what was his comment? He said, “It is what it is.” That’s because he is who he is. Then, when he ran, he told us how much he cared about people like my family and yours, the places we come from. His staff reported him saying, this is about three weeks ago, the truth is, he said that he in fact, thinks that we’re all losers. He doesn’t respect. No, behind closed doors, it’s been reported that he called his own supporters, working class folks that the Democrats along the way began to forget about, what he called them, his supporters, quote, “Disgusting.”\nVice President Joe Biden: (20:06)\nHe’s the same guy who lets you earn a couple bucks parking cars at his country club, but even if you had the money, he wouldn’t allow you to join. They look down the nose at working families trying to do it right. It’s been confirmed by multiple sources that he thinks that those of us who signed up and put our country, put our lives on the line, our veterans, as I mentioned earlier, are just suckers and losers. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. It’s absolutely despicable. I’ll tell you. By the way, six of his generals, who work for him, all say he’s not worthy of being President of the United States of America, his own generals.\nVice President Joe Biden: (20:54)\nI’ll tell you right now, that’s not how I was raised. It’s not how you were raised. It’s not how the vast majority of Americans who break their neck every day just wanting to get a fair shake were raised. By the way, Donald Trump can only see the world from Park Avenue. He cares only what the super rich and connected thinks. He only sees value in stock portfolios. I don’t own a single share of stock. I have the dubious distinction, when I got elected … Maybe that’s why he doesn’t like me very much. I’ve been listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years. You think I’m joking? I’m not proud of it. It’s true. I think you’re supposed to earn money while you’re in politics.\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:51)\nIn addition to that, when I got elected to the Vice Presidency, the headline in the paper saying it’s probable no man has ever assumed the office of the Vice President with few assets than Joe Biden. I don’t think they were speaking intellectually. Guess what? His only metric is how the economy is doing, his Dow Jones. It doesn’t matter if communities like Johnstown are still hurting, and he doesn’t have a plan to help you or get back on your feet or deliver relief to the people who most need help. He’s too busy planning for his next big tax giveaway. It’s a true story. Billionaires made $300 billion more in this pandemic, fact, and now you know what his new tax plan is? He’s proposing another $30 billion tax cut for billionaires by reducing what they call capital gains to 15%. They’ll be making billions and paying a lower rate than a firefighter, a school teacher, a school teacher and a firefighter together, a lower rate. The 100 richest folks in this country, are in fact, own more wealth than about half the population. It’s time, when nearly 30 million people are on unemployment, 100 million people, he’s trying to take away your healthcare. 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, he’s going to court a week after the election to try to eliminate the Affordable Care Act.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:46)\nBy the way, if this, if I tried, if we made a movie about this, they’d think it’s just all fiction. It couldn’t be possible. In the middle of this pandemic, when you have seven million people infected, 40,000-\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:03)\n… million people infected. 40,000 a day becoming infected. 750 to 1000 a day dying. And his one goal is to take away healthcare. Not a joke, not a joke. 10 million people have already lost the healthcare provided by their employers because their employers have gone out of business. 10 million, and 20 million people, if he gets his way, and I think it’s on November 7th, 8th, 9th, or 10th, I go to the Supreme Court.\nSpeaker 2: (24:41)\nNovember 10th, Joe.\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:41)\nThey’ll lose, 20 million people will lose their health insurance.\nSpeaker 3: (24:47)\nDoesn’t matter, Joe.\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:47)\nMore than a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions will in fact be charged more for their coverage. What’s going to happen is, in addition to that, when they eliminate the Affordable Care Act, we’re going to be able to charge women more money running from the same procedures men getting charged for. Not a joke. And that’s what the law he wants to eliminate will do. Pregnancy will become again, not a joke, a pre-existing condition that you can charge a great deal more for. Folks, we can’t let that happen. He’s too busy trying to salvage his foundering re-election campaign to understand that people don’t want a superficial temporary tax cut on their withholding tax because [inaudible 00:25:42] take it out of social security. You know what the social security actuary said? “If this plane goes through, social security will be totally bankrupt by 2023.”\nVice President Joe Biden: (25:56)\nI know this sounds ridiculous. Remember I told you, Paul Ryan was there. They wanted to cut Medicaid and cut social security. That was in their budget. That’s what they want to do. I don’t know where these guys come from. Look, I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life, guys who look down on us because they got them out of money, inherited it, guys who think they’re better than you, guys, who, as I said, might let you park the car at a country club they own but never let you join or come in, guys who inherited everything you’ve ever gotten and then squandered it. I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton. Not a joke. You see it from a different perspective of Johnstown or any time we stopped in today. It’s filled with people who are busting their necks to do right by their families every day. They aren’t worried about the stock market. They’re worried about putting food on the table every night. They’re worried about making the rent. 20 million people are worried they won’t be able to pay their mortgage payment this month. 20 million.\nVice President Joe Biden: (27:08)\nMy mom used to always say, Jean Finnegan Biden from Scranton, she said, “Joey, remember, look at me, Joey, nobody is better than you, but everyone is your equal.” He doesn’t get that. When my dad had to leave Scranton when there were no jobs and we moved to Wilmington, he didn’t have to commute like the woman I met today, her husband, eight hours each way, but he had to commute back and forth to Wilmington every weekend and that was only a three and a half hour drive each way. But when we got to Delaware and finally were able to buy a house three years later, my dad used to day, “Joe, the job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” That’s what was missing today. Providing dignity to the work do we.\nVice President Joe Biden: (28:06)\nThose are the values that shaped my life, and when it gets down to it, I think this whole campaign gets down to Park Avenue versus Scranton. Park Avenue versus Johnstown. Trump may think there ought to be a different set of rules for him and his rich buddies, rules that get them out of taxes, get them out of responsibilities, get them out of consequences for every one of the mistakes they make. But I don’t think so. I think it’s about time to start rewarding work and not wealth. And I think it’s about time that families get a break and the super wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share. We’re still going to do well, even if they pay their fair share. But here’s what I know. Donald Trump will never understand. Wall Street didn’t build this country, CEOs didn’t. The middle class built America and unions built the middle class.\nVice President Joe Biden: (29:14)\nThat’s why my plan is about helping communities like Johnstown and Scranton and Claymont, places I grew up, to build that better. I’m here today to say to you, I’ll do as President what Donald Trump hasn’t. I’ll fight for you. Not for the corporations. You, your jobs, your family. Now we’re going to build back better. It’s all about injecting life and capital back into places like Johnstown. It starts with a simple proposition. Buy American. The federal government spends $600 billion of your taxpayer’s money every single year on everything from military equipment to steel railings to buildings to highways, cars and trucks in federal fleets. While I’m President, we’re going to make sure that every one of those products, every single piece that goes into any of those contracts is made and built in America. I’m serious. We can do this. [inaudible 00:30:24] send jobs overseas. Any company in my administration that off shores jobs will pay a 10% penalty, and any company that brings jobs back or reopens the closed factories like those around Johnstown will get a 10% credit and an incentive to build back.\nVice President Joe Biden: (30:48)\nWe’re going to direct billions of dollars in revitalization funds and competitive grants to help places like Johnstown compete for new businesses and startups. We’re going to make four years of public education, two years of community college free for families making less than under 25 grand. We’re going to lower healthcare costs by increasing subsidies for your premiums so they’re lower, slashing the cost of prescription drugs by literally as much as 60%. And you say, “How do you do that, Joe?” Well, we’re going to do a system that sets up an expert panel of 25 people for every new drug that comes on the market. You have to go before that group of experts, they’ll set the price based on your investment, just like you do for your utility, and you cannot raise that price ever again beyond the cost of medical inflation.\nVice President Joe Biden: (31:46)\nWe’re going to take on the opioid crisis [inaudible 00:31:47] effective treatment, and for substance use disorders. We’re going to do it all without raising a penny in taxes for anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year. If you make more than $400,000, I’m going to raise your taxes. So raise your hand. No, maybe you didn’t believe me that I could do that without raising taxes on the middle class. But hat’s before you found out that the billionaire Donald Trump only paid $750 in income taxes. If Trump’s Park Avenue pals start paying their fair share we’ll have more than enough money to finally build an economy that works for everybody. So I promise you this. I see you. I hear you. I respect you. I grew up with you. And the families of those more than 200,000 Americans that have died in this pandemic will be heard and respected by me.\nVice President Joe Biden: (32:50)\nI’ll work like crazy to get this pandemic under control so we can get our economy working again, for everyone to get back our lives. We’re a nation in incredible pain right now. So many empty chairs around the dining table at night because somebody’s been lost to the family. So many businesses closed, doors closed forever because the money that the Congress voted to get to small businesses went to his friends, his rich friends on Wall Street. So many proud people on unemployment for the first time in their lives, not able to get the kind of unemployment insurance that we initially passed in Congress. As my wife said, “This is not a partisan moment. This is an American moment.” No, I really mean it. We can’t afford to go on being divided. We can’t afford to have a leader who does nothing but throw gasoline on the anger and hatred that’s burning in this country.\nSpeaker 3: (33:54)\nStop the hate.\nVice President Joe Biden: (33:55)\nWe have to come together. Look, I promise you all this. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will be an American President. [crosstalk 00:34:05] for those who support me as those who did not, I promise you this, I’ll fight for you. That’s what we need right now, a President who will try to bring us together, who will speak to what is best in all of us, rather than trying to divide us. Put that dog whistle out, and racism. Did you hear that he said last night? When he was asked by the Fox commentator, asked would he condemn White supremacy, which the FBI says is a serious threat to terrorism in America today, he said, “Well, of course, I’m against all bad news.” I said, “How about the Proud Boys?” “The Proud Boys,” he said, “Well, I’ll tell you what. Just tell them to stand down but stand by.” Go online. The Proud Boys now have a logo saying, “Stand down but stand by.”\nVice President Joe Biden: (35:13)\nAnd they said in the newspaper today that [inaudible 00:35:18] was Vladimir Putin. Not a joke. In fact, threaten that if he doesn’t win, there’ll be violence. Look, we’ve got to stop pitting ourselves against one another. We’re one people. We’re one nation, one America. We need to remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. In our long history, there’s been nothing, nothing ever, think about this. In every crisis we’ve ever had, there’s not going to single thing we’ve been unable to overcome, nothing, when we act together, and we’ve done it together.\nVice President Joe Biden: (36:03)\n… when we act together, we’ve done it together. Folks, I am so optimistic about what the country is ready to do. No, no, I really am. I think we’re ready to stand up, I think the blinders have been taken off the American people. They understand what’s at stake. We can own the 21st century. We are, as Madeleine Albright said, ” The essential country.” We can and must lead the world again. We’ve not only led the world by the example of our power, but the power of our example.\nVice President Joe Biden: (36:42)\nWhy does the rest of the whole follower us? Because of who we are, what we stand for, our example, and it’s being trashed all over the world. There was a recent Pew poll done in the major nations of the world, Donald Trump as president, this is not a joke. Check it online. Donald Trump is less respected than President Xi and Putin. Can you imagine that? So folks, look, as I said, this United States of America, we can do anything, and we’re about to do it. With your help, the grace of God and the goodwill of our neighbors, as my grandpa would say, “We’re coming back.” So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. We are coming back this year. 30 something days. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you.",

         "Frank Spencer: (00:07)\nGood evening. My name’s Frank Spencer and I’m the general vice president for the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. General president McCarron isn’t able to be here today so it’s my honor on behalf of our 550,000 men and women that we represent, to endorse Joe Biden for president and Kamala Harris for vice president. You’re welcome Vice President.\nFrank Spencer: (00:42)\nLeaders stand up for what’s right even when it’s hard, that’s Joe Biden. Leaders tell the truth, even when it’s inconvenient, that’s Joe Biden. Leaders understand that the strength of our country is tied to the strength of the middle class. That means strong unions, protection for workers and a fair tax policy. Joe Biden knows that. Joe stands with working Americans and knows the value union brings to our communities. Joe stands with working carpenters and because of that, we’re proud to stand with Joe Biden, the next president of the United States. Thank you.\nJames Callahan: (01:39)\nGood evening. My name is James Callahan, I’m the general president of the Operating Engineers. 400 members strong, 400,000 members strong and it’s our honor to have the next president of the United States tour our great Local 66 training center that underscores what we do in labor. And it wasn’t a far reach to explain to someone like Joe Biden, what working Americans do. I want to thank Jim Kuntz, the president and vice-president of Local 66, my secretary-treasurer Brian Hickey, who’s flown in from Chicago to underscore and relay to Vice President Biden that we at our general executive board, wholly endorsed him and Senator Harris for the next ticket of the president and vice president of the United States.\nJames Callahan: (02:47)\nAs Joe has said to us many a times, he understands what a paycheck does for working people, not a dividend check for people that are just waiting for a dividend check on their savings or their investment. He understands that people live check to check and the guidance that go with that. And the way that this administration, current administration wants to tear that down. We wholeheartedly endorse as the next president of the United States, Joe Biden. Thank you very much.\nJoe Biden: (03:24)\nBetter not touch it. Hello everybody. It’s great to be here. I just want the record to show that Jim promised, if I get elected president of United States, I can go down to the Houston facility and work and try to drive any this machinery I get a shot at. I used to have a license to drive tractor trailers, but I tell you what, I’m looking at that sucker, that big Caterpillar. That’s a good one. But I’m not sure I want to try that crane, man, that looks awful. That looks awful tough. I know. Well, I’ll tell you what, it’s great to be here.\nJoe Biden: (04:22)\nThere was an old expression when I was growing up in Scranton, you go home with them that brung you to the dance. And labor brought me to the dance a long, long time ago. They’re the ones who are the operating engineers and the carpenters. Early on, first time that I ran, people who laid the tracks and the pipelines, who operate the cranes and shape the skyline, who build the foundations of everything we rely on. Labor as I said, brought me to the dance, not an exaggeration. And the only reason I’m standing here today as a candidate for president, if it hadn’t been for labor back in 1972, when I was a 29 year old kid, just after Labor Day, I was losing the election. I think it was 54 to 19 going into the election. And then labor came on board. Carpenters across the board, just up and down, operating engineers, the steel workers and we ended up winning by an overwhelming margin of 3,200 votes statewide when Nixon won the state was 68% of the vote. I don’t forget.\nJoe Biden: (05:32)\nMy dad used to have an expression for real. He said, “The only way to deal with the abuse of power, Joey, is with power. And the only people can take on major corporate interests and the oligarchs who are abusing power, the working men and women are organized labor.” That’s not an exaggeration. The only ones. The only ones. And that’s why I’ve been so supportive of labor my whole career. I’ve never forgotten everything that they’ve done for me, you’ve done for me, but not just for me, but for the country. You are literally not figuratively, the backbone of America. The military is the spine of America, you’re the backbone of America. An awful lot of you served in the military as well. You’re the ones who actually built this country, not Wall Street bankers and CEOs. You built the country and you’re going to build it and you’re going to build it back better than it was before.\nJoe Biden: (06:32)\nAnd I want thank Jim. I want to thank President Callahan and his team as well as the folks in Local 66 for welcoming me here today and giving us an inside look at everything you’re doing to rebuild and energize Western Pennsylvania. I’m from Eastern Pennsylvania. I’m from up in Lackawanna County in that valley and a lot’s going to happen here. I am so confident. I really am that we’re not only coming back, we’re going to come back big. I mean hardworking folks. I want to thank Vice President Frank Spencer and the carpenters for all they do as well. I’m honored, the trust you’ve placed in me and I want to thank you a lot for it. And if I have the honor of becoming president, I’ll be fighting for you every single day. And I promise you, hear me now, you will have a seat at the table at the White House. No fundamental decisions will be made without you sitting in literally not figuratively. Literally, that’s a word. You have my word on it.\nJoe Biden: (07:31)\nAnd folks, I’ve been on a train today. I’ve traveled, it’s kind of like going back home. I traveled over 2,100,000 miles over 40 years on Amtrak going back and forth every single solitary night to see my kids. A 250 mile round trip. But we came today, we on an Amtrak train, do a whistle stop tour. We started off in Cleveland, across Ohio, into Western Pennsylvania. And riding the rails reminds me of when I would take the train home from Wilmington to Washington and back every night. And I used to go back when you get through round the beltway, going into Baltimore, you go through a number of middle class neighborhoods like houses like I grew up in. Three bedroom split level homes, that kind of thing.\nJoe Biden: (08:19)\nAnd I used to literally, when we’d have debates on the floor of the Senate, look out that window and I’d sit there and I’d see the lights on and the homes we were passing just like we saw coming from Cleveland into Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh to here. And I’d wonder, do they have the same kind of conversations at that table that my mom and dad had at our table? Are they having the same kind of conversations the guys I grew up with, the women I grew up with had? No honey, we can’t get four new tires on the car. We can’t afford it, we got to wait another month. Literally not figuratively, literally. Or, I know we need a new hot water heater. We can’t afford it. We got to wait. It’s going to take a little while longer.\nJoe Biden: (09:08)\nYou have vast majority of the middle class saying before we got into this recession. If they got an unexpected bill for $400 in a month that they didn’t expect, they’d either have to borrow the money or put it off. They’re neighbors I grew up in. You’re the only ones that saved them from people from having to do that if in fact you’re able to have work. Folks, I knew all those families inside and those families and on that route today. I didn’t know their names, but I know what’s on their minds. What their concerns were. They’re not looking for a handout, all they’re looking for is a hand up. My dad used to say, “Joe, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in heck expect them to understand my problem.” We’re not understanding the problems of the vast majority of Americans today. All they’re looking for as a fair shot and a little bit of dignity and a little bit of respect instead of being looked down on so that the parents could look their kids in the eye and say, “Honey, everything’s going to be okay.”\nJoe Biden: (10:22)\nMy dad used to have that expression. After we left Scranton, he had to move to Delaware and commute every day for over a year and finally be able to get us down. Not every day, once a week, come back every week. And finally, we got apartment in Claymont Delaware. A little steel town, has no more steel now. And then we finally ever got a home four years later. But it’s what a lot of people we’re still going through. There’s a stark difference from what I saw last night on the debate stage. An entitled self serving president who inherited everything in his life and squandered it. A president who calls his own supporters, according to some staff members, his own supporters, disgusting. Who thinks that folks who put their lives on the line for our country in the military are losers and suckers. It’s despicable.\nJoe Biden: (11:33)\nI’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life. The guys who might let you park the cars at their country club, pick up a few bucks but even if you had the money, wouldn’t let you join the country club because of your religion or because of your background. Guys who stiff contractors, building their hotels and their golf courses, just to put a few more bucks in their pocket, seems to take some joy in it. Guys who think the rules don’t apply to them. Guys and make tens of millions of dollars and pay $750 in federal taxes in a year.\nJoe Biden: (12:17)\nDonald Trump sees things from Park Avenue. I see him from where I grew up in Scranton and Claymont. My mom, Jean Finnegan Biden had a backbone like a ramrod, all five foot one of her. And my mom used to have an expression. I really mean it. I used to be a stutter and it’s when you’re a stutter you’re used to bullies. It’s easy to make fun of somebody who talks like that. That’s how I learned to fight. Joke used to be, Biden’s like shoe leather. You can beat him, but he’s going to hurt you. You have to stand up to these folks. Well, my mom would say, “Joey, look at me, look at me. Remember, nobody is better than you, nobody, but everybody’s your equal.” And she meant it. She meant it. As I said, my dad’s expression when we moved to Delaware was he’d talk about how a job is a lot more than about a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.\nJoe Biden: (13:30)\nThose values shaped my whole life. If you look back on my career, you notice it shaped my whole career, my Build Back Better plan. It shaped my views as president what I’ll do. It’s all about giving communities like Greensburg and New Alexandra and Claymont and Scranton and places in parts of Cleveland I just came out of, giving women and men who work on pipelines and construction sites a fair shot. We’re going to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure, including more than 50 billion in one year to get to repairing our schools, our highways, our bridges, revitalizing our locks and our dams, making our inland waterways the finest in the world. That’s what attracts businesses. That’s what brings employment. You talk about how much my plan costs. Well, guess what? Those investments are going to create millions of high paying jobs. Building a modern infrastructure and a durable energy future. And I promise you this, in my administration, collective bargaining, now hear me, collective bargaining will be sacred. It’s a guarantee. A guarantee. And union apprenticeships, union apprenticeships will be sacred. Last thing we need is corporate America taking over apprenticeships programs like they tried to do.\nJoe Biden: (14:58)\nWe’re going to stand up for prevailing wage and benefit productions and the Davis Bacon Act. I guarantee. You may recall the president, he used to like to surprise me at State of the Union addresses says, “And Sheriff Joe will take care of the Build Back.” we didn’t call it Build Back Better, it was Recovery Act $800 billion. Not a single project was not prevailing wage. It’s a guarantee, every single solitary project we built. And so folks, we’re going to level the playing field for you and for your families. We’re going to have wages and benefits. We’re going to lower healthcare cost, prescription drug prices. We’re going to take on the opioid crisis for real, with effective treatment. Making four years of public college universities, apprentice programs, tuition free, anybody making less than $125,000 a year if they go to a state university, they go to a community college it’s automatic. If they’re in an apprentice program, it’s going to be free.\nJoe Biden: (16:07)\nMy wife has an expression. She’s a community college professor, “Any country that out educates us will out compete us.” The cost is staggering for people having to carry the burden. And we’re going to do it without asking anyone who makes under $400,000 a year to pay one more penny in taxes, guaranteed, my word on it, because what we’re going to do, we’re going to get rid of the God awful $2 trillion tax cut that Trump passed. 1.4 trillion of it going to the top 1%, a significant portion of that going to the top 1/10th of 1%. We’re going to start rewarding work, not wealth. We’re going to make sure corporations began to pay. The Fortune 500 companies, 91 don’t pay a single penny in taxes and some of them make multi-billion dollars. How about your taxes? You pay nothing in taxes?\nJoe Biden: (17:07)\nWe’re not going to punish anybody, everybody’s going to pay their fair share. Look, a lot of people around here voted for Donald Trump last time. I get it. I understand why. I’ve been asked many times in recent years, “How do we get to a place where the people who teach our kids, take care of our sick, build our bridges, operate our cranes, who race into burning buildings and don’t ask who’s in the other end there, whether you’re black or white or Muslim or Christian, people who in fact grow our food, how do we get to a place where they don’t think we don’t see them? Or hear them? Or respect them?” Well, I see them. I hear them. I respect them. I know them. They’re family and it’s going to change. It’s going to change with me. Look, this is not a partisan moment. This is an American moment. And I mean that seriously. Think about it.\nJoe Biden: (18:10)\nWe have a chance to put the anger and division that has overtaken this country behind us. We can be what we are at our best. One people, one America. We just need to remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. Think about this. Never once in our history, when we’ve set our mind to it, have we not been able to accomplish whatever we set our mind to do when we’ve done it together. There’s not a single thing we can’t do. And with your help, I’m going to get elected. And with us working together, I promise you. I promise you, it’s going to be a different America. We again, reward work not just wealth. Where people are treated with decency.\nJoe Biden: (19:05)\nI’ll conclude by saying, a president’s words matter, no matter how good or bad a president is, the words they utter matter and can take us to war. They can bring peace, they can make the market rise or fall, they can change people’s lives. And this president has breathed hate and division under the rocks here. Hate only hides. It doesn’t go away. And it matters what presidents say. And you heard what he said last night, when he was asked by the moderator, “Will you condemn white supremacy?” And he fuddled around didn’t say anything. I said, “How about the Proud Boys?” And he said, “Well,” the context he likes he said, “just tell them to stand down and stand by.” Go online. Look up Proud Boys they’ve got a new emblem now, literally. It says, “Stand down and stand by.” Implying that if he loses the election, something may have to be done. I promise you that won’t happen. The American people are going to speak. They’re going to speak in large numbers and nobody is going to get in the way of our democratic process going forward. Nobody, period.\nJoe Biden: (20:47)\nThis is the United States of America. We’re not as some tin horn, dictator shepherded, third world country. This is the United States of America. I want to thank you all for your endorsements. I really mean it. Means a lot to me personally, just on a personal level I appreciate it. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you so very much.",

         "Joe Biden: (00:00)\n… I just want you to know that I appreciate the opportunity to be here and appreciate the opportunity to move on. Alliance started as a place where people came together and it’s what we so badly need to do now in this country, is begin, again, to come together. We rode today with some remarkable Ohioans and whose families are here, Tiffany Davis and her husband, Tom, and her kids and Jacqueline, [Komar 00:00:25] and her husband, William, and their daughter and grandson, and [Dave Worshack 00:00:35] and his wife, Kathy, and their children.\nJoe Biden: (00:36)\nIt was an honor to get a chance to meet them and to spend a little time talking about their circumstances. How Tom who worked online at Lordstown is now making that eight hour drive to Kentucky so he can keep a job and make a living, and Jacqueline who taught high school math at Maple Heights for years, and now worries, what’s going to happen to William if they lose the protections that are available through Obamacare for preexisting conditions? And Dave who’s fighting like hell for his coworkers after management announced the Akron plant was going to close this year. Like millions of hardworking Americans, they’re not looking for a handout, they’re just looking for a fair shot to be seen, to be understood, to be heard.\nJoe Biden: (01:28)\nThey remind me of my dad. I was from another Valley, a little further East, the Lackawanna Valley, Scranton, Pennsylvania. My dad had a job in Scranton and when coal died and everything started to close up, we ended up in a circumstance where my dad did what you’re doing old buddy, only he didn’t have to do it for eight hours, what made that, what I called the longest walk a parent ever has to make, up a short flight of stairs and say, “Honey, I’m not going to be home during the week. I’m going to have to move down, in this case, to Delaware.”\nJoe Biden: (02:02)\nThat was only about a three and a half hour ride at that time, not an eight hour ride. He did that for well over a year, and finally was able to get us to … We had to move. There was no work. My dad, it just reminds me of what he used to always say, and I apologize the press hearing me say this many times, but it’s a fact and it’s relevant. My dad used to say in Wilmington, Delaware, when we finally were able to purchase a home, move on an apartment and get going again. My dad would say, “Joe remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to hold your head up. Be able to look at your kid and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.”” “Well, the fact is I don’t expect the government to solve my problem,” he’d say, “But I do expect them to at least understand the problem.”\nJoe Biden: (03:00)\nThat’s what last night’s debate was about, this whole election is about, does your president have any idea and understand what you’re going through? And if he does, does he care about it? Is he able, as my mom would say, be able to walk a mile and your shoes, if you wanted to know me, they’re able to do that? Or does he just ignore you, look down on you, lie to you, like this president did when he told Ohio workers that, “Don’t sell your house, don’t sell your house because no more factories are going to close.” What I saw last night was all about him. He didn’t speak to you or your concerns or the American people even once.\nJoe Biden: (03:41)\nDonald Trump broke his promise. He said he was running for the forgotten American. As soon as he got elected, he forgot them. I’ll never forget. You know, I understand what you do. Wall Street did not build this country. CEOs did not build this country, hard working average American people, given half a chance, built this country. The middle-class built country and unions built the middle class. I tell you what, I never forget that where I came from. A measure our successes as a nation is not how well the stock market is doing. It’s what families are able to talk about and what they deal with at their kitchen table.\nJoe Biden: (04:24)\nMany of the people who will hear this today woke up this morning at a kitchen table where there was one less, was an empty chair or one less chair, because they lost someone. 205,000 dead because of COVID. Over 7 million infected. It’s just … And what happened last night? Did you hear a word from the president about any of that? Look tables like the one that we saw last night are ones that were set by Trump. For 36 years, as I said, I took a 250 mile round trip on Amtrak every day to commute from Wilmington to Washington. I got to know the engineers, the conductors, the folks in the food service card.\nJoe Biden: (05:13)\nAt night as I’d ride home and going between Washington and Baltimore, I see those lights on and those homes along the tracks, middle-class homes, three bedroom split-level types that I grew up in, and I’d often wonder, “What are they talking about? What are they dealing with? What’s going on in their heads? What was it like what’s going on at my house? “No, honey, you got to ride on those tires for another four or five, 6,000 miles. We can’t afford new ones right now.”” Or who’s going to tell her? Who’s going to tell him they can’t go back to that school because we just don’t have the money? Or what are we going to do?\nJoe Biden: (05:51)\nI can remember my father, we lived in a three bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop. I can remember the walls were thin. I can remember my dad rolling around at night. I could hear him. Our room was next to him. I remember asking my mom one day, “What’s the matter with dad?” She said, “We just lost the insurance. We have no health insurance.” So look, these are the things that people are worried about. My guess is that the same thing is happening everywhere in America. The question people are asking is, is it going to be okay?\nJoe Biden: (06:23)\nFolks, this election, in my view, is between Scranton and Park Avenue, between Alliance and Park Avenue. It’s about whether or not the parents are going to look their kids in the eye and going to be able to say, “It’s going to be okay.” That’s what we talked about on the way down here on the train. We talked about it all along this whistle stop tour because I’m coming into places where people are hurting, where people have lost their jobs, but where there used to be real opportunity. This is all about, in my view, how we’re going to support working families to give people an equal shot, just so they can be able to have a chance to be able to just make a decent living.\nJoe Biden: (07:05)\nAnd folks to protect your pensions, your healthcare, to make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. To me, that’s what this is all about. It’s a trade-off. Do we allow corporate America to continue to pay [inaudible 00:07:21] pay no tax at all while you’re having your healthcare taken away in the name of, “We can’t afford it.” Do we allow billionaire to get another $30 billion tax break So they pay a lower rate than you pay if you have a job as a school teacher? Do we allow that? Or do we invest in our schools? What should we be doing right now? And what should we be doing for the last five months?\nJoe Biden: (07:47)\nThe president, instead of being in the sand trap in his golf course, should be in the White House and the Oval Office, inviting Democrats and Republicans to be there with him and to settle, settle how we’re going to make sure we can bail out the small businesses that are going under. Make sure people can keep their insurance, making sure we have the ability to open our stores and our schools safely. It costs money to do that, but what’s he doing? He’s doing nothing.\nJoe Biden: (08:14)\nBy the way, I find it fascinating. They had time at the very end of this election to hold a hearing on a Supreme Court justice, but the Senate does not have time to deal with making sure schools and businesses have the PPE they need, the protective gear, does not have the sanitary conditions available to them and the money to pay for them to open up, does not have the capacity and so on. It’s kind of amazing, isn’t it? They have time to rush through a nominee after an election has already started, but no time to deal with the everyday concerns about the American people.\nJoe Biden: (08:50)\nLook, let me conclude by saying, not withstanding where we are right now, I am extremely optimistic. I’m optimistic because the American people know this is not who we are. They’re ready to get up again. They’re ready to come back. We just have to give them a shot. So we’re better positioned than any nation in the world to take back this 21st century, we’re ready to do it, but we’re going to only do it if we do it together. If I get elected president, I’m not going to be the Democrat president, I’m going to be an American president. I’m going to represent you whether you vote for me or you vote against me. This is about the United States of America, our place in the world and the security and wellbeing of people just given an equal chance, an equal chance to have a shot at the American dream that’s been denied them right now.\nJoe Biden: (09:42)\nThank you very much for listening. I’m happy to take questions. I don’t even know where to start. I guess I’ll start and work my way a little bit. Yes?\nSpeaker 2: (09:51)\n[inaudible 00:09:51] with NPR, what did you learn last night about going face-to-face with President Trump? Would you do anything different next time? Also, there’s a lot of talk about given the way things went last night, two more debates aren’t worth having. What do you think about that?\nJoe Biden: (10:07)\nIt’s not an inconsequential assertion. Look, he did what I expected him to do last night. He announced what he was going to do. He announced he was going to … I think the phrase was, “Now we can become really vicious.” I think that was his phrase, at some point. Look, last night reinforced for me why I got in this race in the first place. Last night, and I said, when I got in the race, we were in the battle for the soul of this country.\nJoe Biden: (10:39)\nCan you all see me? Should I turn this way a little bit?\nJoe Biden: (10:42)\nTrump’s constant disregard and unwillingness to speak to COVID and the fact that 205 thousand people have already died, and over 7 million are infected and it’s likely to get worse. He didn’t want to talk about it at all.\nJoe Biden: (11:02)\nIn terms of election legitimacy, he made it clear that if he lost, it wouldn’t be a legitimate election. Already began to plant seeds of doubt in the legitimacy of this election. I don’t know any president’s ever done that before. His dog whistle, the white supremacy, when asked, “Would he condemn white supremacy?” He didn’t say a word. Then when I said, “Well, how about the Proud Boys?” Which is a white supremacist group. He said, “Well, I just told them to stand down and stand ready,” stand down and stand ready based on the outcome of the election?\nJoe Biden: (11:40)\nLast night was, I think, a wake up call for all Americans. What I tried to do, last night, I tried to speak directly into the camera to the American people, to talk about their concerns, to talk about what’s on their mind, to talk about what I would do, were I president. Trump has no plants, no ideas, didn’t express a single plan that he had about how he’s going to move forward. It made me realize just how much is at stake. For 90 minutes, he tried everything to distract, everything possible and it just didn’t work. But I hope that this next debate is going to be in front of real live people, it’s going to be a town hall. I just hope we’re able to … I’m looking forward to it. I hope we’re able to get a chance to actually answer the questions that are asked by the persons in the room, but God only knows what he’ll do. Yes.\nSpeaker 3: (12:45)\nIs there any scenario where you would not debate the president in these next two debates? And are there any changes you want to see made by the commission before you debate?\nJoe Biden: (12:57)\nWell he not only attacked me constantly, and my family, but he attacked the moderator. Again, on his tweets this morning or last night. I just hope there’s a way of which the debate commission can control the ability of us to answer the question without interruptions. I’m not going to speculate on what happens in the second or third debate. My hope is that they’re able to literally say, “The question gets asked of Trump. He has the microphone, he has two minutes to answer the question. No one else has a microphone.” Then I don’t know what the actual rules are going to be, literally, but that would seem to me to make some sense, but I’m looking forward to it.\nSpeaker 3: (13:47)\nWhat do you have to say to those undecided persuadable voters who were watching last night and were just completely turned off by politics?\nJoe Biden: (13:55)\nI can understand it. It was … I kind of thought, at one point, maybe I shouldn’t say this, but the president of the United States conducted himself the way he did. I think it was just a national embarrassment. But look, I just hope that the American people and those undecided voters try to determine what each of us has an answer for their concerns and allows us to actually speak. Yes.\nSpeaker 4: (14:41)\nThank you, Mr. Vice President, you mentioned the president’s comments about the Proud Boys, “Stand back and stand by.” Today, they’ve made that really a rallying cry, they’re rallying around that slogan, almost that they’ve created now for it. What are your fears about the implications of the president’s rhetoric? And do you have a message for the Proud Boys today?\nJoe Biden: (15:00)\nCease and desist. Cease and desist. The American people will decide who the next president of United States will be period. So I’m urging the American people go out and vote, show up. If you can vote early, vote early, vote whatever way is most convenient for you, but vote. If you show up in large enough numbers, nothing is going to change.\nJoe Biden: (15:25)\nI promise you if in fact we win this election, this president will step down. It’s a lot of bravado. He has no alternative. The American people will not stand for it, no agency would stand for that happening. My message to the Proud Boys and every other white supremacist group is cease and desist. That’s not who we are. This is not who we are as Americans.\nSpeaker 5: (15:48)\nLast question.\nSpeaker 6: (15:48)\nMr. Vice President.\nJoe Biden: (15:50)\nAll right, I’m going to let you pick somebody because you got everybody out here.\nSpeaker 7: (15:58)\nOkay. Mr. Vice President. Thank you for giving me a question.\nJoe Biden: (16:04)\nI think this works, yes.\nSpeaker 7: (16:06)\nOh, great. Okay. I wanted to … just about last night, you said a few things that put some distance between yourself and the liberal wing of the party on the Green New Deal and Medicare for all. Can you talk a little bit about whether or not you could be going a little bit too far to the center and alienating some people on the left? And related to that, have you spoken with AOC today or recently?\nJoe Biden: (16:35)\nNo, I haven’t. I appreciated her endorsement. Look, we had a debate with, I don’t know, 20 to 25 people in the Democratic Party. I said at the time that I would tell you exactly what I believed and I would say why I believed it and why I was running. That’s exactly what I did. I did not support Medicare for all. I do not support it now. I support the Biden plan that I’ve laid out. I’ve laid out the most extensive plan with the detail on how I will get us to net zero emissions in the energy sector by 2035, putting thousands of people to work. I’ve laid out how, in fact, I’m going to get us to net zero emissions in the United States of America by 2050 across the board, how I’d rejoin the Paris Accord, which I helped put together, et cetera.\nJoe Biden: (17:34)\nSo the Green New Deal that the president keeps trying to talk about, it’s not a bad deal, but it’s not the plan I have, that’s the Biden green deal. That’s what this is about. What the president keeps trying to do is he’s trying to run somebody other than me. I’ve said to the left, to the right, and the center, exactly where I am on each of these issues. I did have time and I’ve worked very hard with all segments of the party. We put together a platform that is a platform that I fully support.\nJoe Biden: (18:07)\nThe President keeps talking about … What’s he call it? He has some name for our platform, I can’t remember what it is. Is the-\nSpeaker 7: (18:15)\nManifesto.\nJoe Biden: (18:18)\nThe manifesto. Thank you. The manifesto. Well, the Democratic platform is the one that I’ve signed on to. The one that the vast majority, overwhelming majority, of Democrats signed on to. But the democratic party is a big tent and we have all kinds of folks in it that have different views and they’re all welcome. We negotiated, we debated and we had a primary election and I won and I’ve laid out what we’re going to do. So I’m not worried about losing the left, right, or the center of the party, this is a big party, but I have one of the most progressive records any Democrats run on. I’m proud of it, but it’s my record, and it’s what I want to do. So thank you. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 7: (18:58)\nIf I could just follow up with a fun related question?\nJoe Biden: (19:08)\nYou don’t mind, I’m going to get in trouble with the conductor because I’d like to stay and answer a lot of your questions. Do I think he’s created a crisis in confidence? Look, all you have to do is look at the polls all your networks run, and a significant member of the American people are worried about what he recommends having anything to do with … Look there, right? Is that what you’re trying to tell me? To deal with the COVID crisis. They’ve lost confidence in him.\nJoe Biden: (19:38)\nSo that’s why I think it’s really important that the scientists continue to speak out, say exactly what constitutes an appropriate approach to dealing with COVID, whether it is a vaccine or any other proposal, and God willing, we’re going to have a vaccine sooner than later, God willing, we’ll be able to distribute it as rapidly as possible.\nJoe Biden: (20:00)\nBut it gets down to, ultimately, the American people have to have trust in the what the president says, and it’s quite clear, many, many, many people don’t trust him. As it relates as well to businesses. They say, “Open up.” Even businesses opened up are having trouble getting people to come in because, in fact, the president says things that are just not accurate.\nJoe Biden: (20:24)\nBut I’m confident that we’re going to get in this train or y’all are going to have to run behind it and we got to get going. But thank you all very much. I’ll talk to you the next stop, wherever I’m doing. Thank you.",

         "Speaker 1: (00:48)\nPlease welcome the Reverend Dr. Marvin McMickle\nMarvin McMickle: (01:10)\nGood morning. This is going to be something of a litany in which there will be an opportunity for all of you to respond if you choose to. If prayer is within your spirit, then I will give you the signal to pray with these words we pray to you, oh God. But I will signal when it is time to do that. Let us pray. Gracious and eternal God. Sovereign Lord, over all the earth, we acknowledge that you are the author and the architect of the whole of creation. You are the source of life and goodness for all the nations that dwell on the planet. You, oh God gave shape to the mountains, depths to the oceans, flight to the birds, fragrance to the flowers and warmth to the sun. Every good and perfect gift comes from you. And we honor you this morning with our prayer of thanksgiving.\nMarvin McMickle: (02:21)\nWe also come before you with our prayer of petition. We know that you are not defined by the partisan politics of a single nation, but we hope and pray that you will hear and heed our requests today. We pray today for Joseph Biden, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, because we believe that they are best suited to lead and guide our nation in ways that are important to us and consistent with your designs for the world. We pray, oh God, that they will lead us in ways that make us better stewards of the creation in which, and upon which we all depend. Save us from people and policies, so driven by greed and short-term gain that they have no regard for clean air, clean water, the land rights of the indigenous people, the financial strains of small farmers, black and white, or the changing climate that is fueling fierce fires, howling hurricanes and shrinking species.\nMarvin McMickle: (03:35)\nAnd now I invite you to say, “We pray to you, oh God.” We pray for these two candidates amid a global health pandemic that is consuming lives, livelihoods, and life savings across the country and around the world. So give to them, oh God, the wisdom to lead our nation in ways that seem to have escaped those who are currently holding the reins of power in this country. We’ve witnessed more than 205,000 dead, more than 7 million infected, more than 16 million unemployed, just in this country. And the virus is not through with us yet. At this critical hour, we need leadership marked by courage in the face of the problem and compassion in response to the suffering. And so we say, we pray to you, oh God. Our nation has a tragic history of racial and ethnic oppression that has recently overflowed to the streets of our cities and towns.\nMarvin McMickle: (04:47)\nIn memory of those who have been lynched, shot, beaten, burned out, or forced to leave their ancestral lands along a trail of tears. We pray for leaders that will serve we, the people, all the people, all races, all income groups, all regions, all religions, who long for the promise of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We pray to you, oh God. We pray for our fragile democracy. We pray for the continuation of a government of the people and by the people and for the people. There are forces at work today that are endangering this American experiment. The nation needs new leaders that will preserve that principle by honoring the outcome of elections, by disavowing foreign interference in our electoral process, by paying their taxes and by safeguarding the right of every American to participate in free and fair elections. And so we say, we pray to you, oh God. Finally, we pray for the candidates themselves.\nMarvin McMickle: (06:12)\nWe pray for their stamina, as they endure the rigors of a national campaign. We pray for their spirits, as their character and their competence are regularly and relentlessly attacked. We pray for their clarity of purpose, always reminding them that this electoral process is about we, the people, and not just an opportunity to advance their own egos and agendas as some have done in recent years.\nMarvin McMickle: (06:45)\nWe pray for their families. we pray for their spouses. We pray for their children and their siblings. And if these candidates are blessed to win the selection, then keep them and their families as they take on the enormous burden of governing our nation and helping to safeguard our world. And we close, oh God with two hymns. Our fathers God to the author of liberty. To thee, we sing long may our land be bright with freedom’s holy light, protect us by thy might, great God, our King. And God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, thou who has brought us thus far on the way. Thou who has by thy might let us into the light, keep us forever in the path, we pray. Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee. Lest our hearts, drunk with a wine of the world forget thee. Shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand true to our God, true to our native land. We pray to you, oh God. Amen.\nSpeaker 1: (08:42)\nPlease welcome, jill Biden.\nDr. Jill Biden: (09:04)\nGood morning. Thank you, Reverend Dr. McMickle. That was beautiful. Thank you so much. You know, with everything that’s going on, faith has never felt more important, in our spiritual beliefs, in our communities, and in the potential of our nation. You remind us of all three, so thank you for your beautiful words today and for joining us. So hello, Cleveland, and didn’t Joe do a great job last night? I thought he was so strong, and he looked so presidential. Thank you. Thank you.\nDr. Jill Biden: (09:54)\nOver these last few months, I’ve been talking to communities about school reopenings, and a few weeks ago, I spoke to a public school counselor who told me something that really I won’t forget. She said, “The two most important roles in my life are being a school counselor and being a mom.” And right now, I feel like I’m failing at both. As a parent, I want to have all the answers for my kids, but over these last four years, so many parents have told me that they have more questions than answers. Like, “How do I keep my family safe from this pandemic?” “What if a shooting happens at our school?” “What if I lose my job?” And, “How do I tell my kids to be kind when our leaders don’t live up to that same standard?” And not just parents, all of us feel it. The chaos of this moment, the magnitude of the loss that surrounds us, and the acrimony that we see way too often.\nDr. Jill Biden: (11:13)\nThere are those who want to us to believe that our nation is hopelessly divided, that our differences are irreconcilable, that our communities are fractured beyond repair. And beneath that is another message. “Your voice can’t fix it.” “Your vote won’t change it.” Oh, how about this one? “It is what it is.” But that’s not who we are. Is it, Ohio? Just look at what we’ve seen over these last few months. We’re coming together and we’re holding onto one another. We’re finding mercy and grace in the moments that we might have once taken for granted. We’re seeing that our differences are precious and that our similarities are infinite. Democrat and Republican, rural and urban, our communities are showing that the heart of this nation still beats with kindness and courage.\nDr. Jill Biden: (12:19)\nWe don’t agree on everything, and we know that we don’t have to. We can still love and respect each other. We care more about people than politics, and we know that we are not fractured. We’re not broken. We’re because coming something new. We just need steady leadership to help us heal and move us forward. And that’s my husband, Joe Biden. He will be a president for all Americans, and he has a plan for all Americans. He and Kamala have the fortitude to lead us out of Donald Trump’s chaotic America. They have the character to help us heal and the vision to help us rebuild for a future that is better than ever. But they can’t do it without you, because this is it. There are no do-overs. We can’t sit back and just watch what happens. We have to decide what happens.\nDr. Jill Biden: (13:33)\nCynics play to our fears. They tell us that we can’t make a difference because they don’t want us to try. They know that together, our voices are more powerful than they ever could be, and we have to show them our power. We have to believe that our communities are stronger than the challenge we face, because they are. We have to believe that our votes matter, because they do. We have to show up right now, put our shoulders back, and work like we’ve never worked before. So will you join us? Will you prove the cynics wrong? Will you help show that our nation will never settle for less than our highest aspirations? Will you stand with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? Because Ohio, when you do, we know that we will win.\nDr. Jill Biden: (14:34)\nSo I want to end by saying thank you. Thank you for all that all of you do for your communities. Thank you for showing up right now when it matters. And thank you for your faith in an idea that’s bigger than any one of us, and that is that we will, we will build a better nation, because we are going to do this together. So thank you, Ohio. Thank you. Thank you, Ohio.\nDr. Jill Biden: (15:13)\nAnd now it is my pleasure to invite a fellow educator to the stage. One of the millions of teachers across this country who are working overtime and rising to the moment to make sure our students can learn no matter what. So I’d like you to meet Tiffany Davis. Tiffany?\nTiffany Davis: (16:02)\nThank you so much, Dr. Biden, for that introduction. It’s an honor to be introduced by you, especially as a fellow educator. Good morning, everyone. My name is Tiffany Davis, and I’m a fifth grade teacher at Lordstown Elementary School in Lordstown, Ohio. Like Joe and Jill Biden, we’re a union strong household, and we’re fighters. My husband, Tom, is a proud member of the United Auto Workers, and I’m an Ohio Federation of Teachers member.\nTiffany Davis: (16:36)\nIn the Valley, we’re tough. We’re resilient. We keep building, but President Trump’s failure to protect American manufacturing jobs in Lordstown has torn us apart. Families have been separated and uprooted from the community we know and love. My husband, Tom, worked the assembly line at the General Motors Lordstown plant for 17 years before the plant closed its doors last March. As a family, we made the agonizing decision for Tom to accept a transfer to the GM plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, so he could retain his job and pension benefits, and so our family could maintain our health care coverage. Bowling Green, Kentucky, is eight hours away, and my husband makes this drive every single weekend to see me and our two children, Aubrey and Brian, who are just seven and 12 years old. They miss their dad, and I miss my husband, and it didn’t have to be this way.\nTiffany Davis: (17:48)\nIn 2017, Donald Trump campaigned in Youngstown, just down the road from us. He told us not to sell our homes, promising to keep plants like Lordstown open, and to save Ohio manufacturing jobs.\nTiffany Davis: (18:02)\n… open, and to save Ohio manufacturing jobs. Less than two years later, he didn’t lift a finger as Lordstown closed its doors, and more than 5,400 jobs were lost. Our story is not unique. Our friends and family are now scattered throughout the country, either working at other General Motors facilities or continuing to look for work. Five of my own students had to move from Lordstown as a result of the plant closure. We know the truth. Our community was left behind by Donald Trump and his broken promises. Joe Biden will never leave us behind because no one has more respect for the working women and men who get up every day to build this country than he does. Joe knows Scranton is a lot like the Valley. He’s got a plan to build our economy back better for working families, just like mine.\nTiffany Davis: (18:59)\nJoe will mobilize the talent, grit, and innovation of Ohioans to ensure the future is made in all of America, by all of Americans. The Valley needs fighters like Joe and Jill Biden in the White House for us. And there’s no one tougher than a teacher to fight for our kids like Dr. Jill Biden will do as First Lady. Ohio is ready to build back better. Ohio is ready for Joe Biden. With that, it is my honor to introduce and welcome back to Ohio, the next President of the United States, Joe Biden.\nJoe Biden: (19:48)\nHey everybody. I have to tell y’all, it’s great to see you.\nJoe Biden: (20:10)\nHello Cleveland. Don’t jump. Folks, I was reminiscing as we drove to the station, I spent the bulk of my adult life driving to an Amtrak station. I commuted every day from Wilmington, Delaware to Washington DC when I got elected as a young Senator, right after my wife and daughter were killed, and I didn’t plan on staying in the Senate, but I agreed I’d stay for six months, a long time ago, and I started commuting and the fact is they tell me I’ve logged more than 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak. So it’s good to be here. It’s not as fast as the helicopter, but I made a lot of family and friends on Amtrak. So I’m looking forward to getting on the train with you guys.\nJoe Biden: (21:19)\nI want to start off by saying that it’s great to be in Ohio and with my so many friends, members of Congress, local elected officials. It’s an honor to be here with Tiffany. I know how hard it is for her. And I say I know, I was in the position of her children. My dad went through the same thing, Mr. Mayor. Back in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he lost his job. And I remember him walking up the stairs, making what I call that longest walk a parent has to make to tell a child that he’s going to have to leave. My dad didn’t have an eight hour ride. He only had a three hour ride, three and a half hour ride. He moved to Wilmington, Delaware. Took a couple of years before he could bring us back down to Delaware, come home every weekend, but to make sure that we’re all together again. It’s a hard slog. A lot of people have made that. And Tiffany, you’re a wonderful, wonderful mother, teacher, and the way you talk about your husband, he and I have something in common. We both married way up. I want to say that my dad, when he was, I apologize to Congressman Lamb, he’s heard me say this a lot, but my dad, when we moved back to Delaware, moved to Delaware, would say all the time to his children, my siblings and I, he’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to hold your head up. It’s being able to look your child in the eye and say, it’s going to be okay. That’s what a job is about.” And Tiffany, when I think about your husband taking that job eight hours away, although it’s a hundred years ago, I think about my dad, and I imagine your husband has the same stamina, and you do, as my mom and dad did.\nJoe Biden: (23:27)\nThe fact is that last night’s debate, and this election, is supposed to be about you, Tiffany, about you and all the people I grew up with in Scranton, and people in Youngstown, and Claymont, Delaware, and all the people who make a difference. Does any President, does your President understand at all what you’re going through, what so many other people are going through? Question is does he see you where you are and where you want to be? Does he care? As he tried to walk in your shoes, to understand what’s going on in your life? Or does he just ignore you and all the folks all over America who are in a similar situation? I think he’s more than ignoring us. I look at things from Scranton’s perspective, he looks at from Park Avenue. I think he basically looks down on us. He judges us.\nJoe Biden: (24:38)\nThe fact is that I think that when he called our military, and I see we got some veterans here too, thank you for your service man, but when he called our veterans who lost their lives and served suckers and losers, I thought it was one of the most despicable things that I’ve ever heard a President say. Guys you are soldiers or a veteran, you served your country, like you did, like you did Connor, like my son did. What he does, he lies to you. He lies to you about exactly what’s happened. Does he lie to you when, like this president did to your husband, that all the workers at GM plant in Lordstown were going to be in good shape. You remember what he said?\nJoe Biden: (25:29)\nAnd you said it to me, he said, “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house because no Ohio factory will shut down in Donald Trump’s America.” He doesn’t pay his fair share, don’t worry about that. He doesn’t pay his fair share in taxes. He says that makes him smart. What does that do? What does that make you, Tiffany, make me, and millions of other hard working Americans, decent people who pay our taxes? Are we the suckers? Are we stupid because we go by the rules? He’s too weak to beat the pandemic. Cost him more than 200,000 American lives. That’s upended every part of our lives and hit working people particularly hard. Your businesses are closed and schools aren’t back to normal because Donald Trump hasn’t done his job.\nJoe Biden: (26:19)\nHe hasn’t pulled Congress together to provide real relief for working people, moms, and dads, and business owners. The fact is Congress has passed a significant recovery bill, but he’s too busy being in a bunker, or in his golf course to call them into the White House to work out an agreement. He told FEMA to cut off funding for school PPE, masks, and protective gear, because it’s not a national emergency. His response during the deadly pandemic is to try to take your healthcare away by asking the Supreme Court to strike the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. Wipe it out.\nJoe Biden: (27:03)\n… the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, wipe it out, taking us back to a time when insurance companies could deny you coverage for preexisting conditions. Now, because of COVID, lung scarring or heart problems is a consequence of having survived COVID. That could be the next pre-existing conditions affecting millions of people. Taking away Medicare benefits for seniors. Throw your adult kids off your healthcare insurance.\nJoe Biden: (27:28)\nThink about his plan for your social security. The social security actuary said that if he follows through on his plan for social security, social security will be quote, “Bankrupt by 2023.” It clear that he not only cares about Wall Street and the super wealthy and the Fortune 500, he thinks they built this country. That’s why he wants another $30 billion tax cut for the hundred wealthiest billionaires in the country, who have already made $ 30 billion during this pandemic. So they’ll pay a lower tax rate than you do as a teacher, a factory worker, a firefighter, a nurse. He gave a tax giveaway for corporations and they moved jobs overseas to sell goods back to the United States. Here comes the train that he tried to make sure didn’t continue to run.\nJoe Biden: (28:26)\nThat’s the commuter. All right. But folks, look, he let big corporation jump in front of the line to get the recovery aid that Congress had passed while small businesses are struggling to say open. In the end, his measure of economic health is the stock market. In four years as president, he’s broken his promise, he’s forgotten the forgotten Americans he said he was always going to fight for.\nJoe Biden: (28:56)\nWell, I never will forget. I know the middle class working people built this country and I measure our economic success by what families are talking about around their kitchen tables this morning. Some of them with an empty chair because they lost a family member. The ones I saw every night on my train ride from Washington to Wilmington, Delaware, as I said after my wife and daughter were killed when I was first elected, I started going home every single night so I’d be there in the morning to get my kids, Beau Hunter and Ashley ready for school. Actually, Jill, God love her, she came into our life five years later and made things good.\nJoe Biden: (29:37)\nFor 36 years, I said, I took that 250 mile round trip journey each day. I’d get to know the train engineers, the conductors, the fellow passengers, and at night, I’d see the pinpoints of lights in the homes in the cities and towns along the way from Washington to Wilmington and wonder what those families are talking about after they put their kids to bed. My guess is the same thing that all Americans across the country are talking about today, asking questions as profound and as ordinary as, will we be okay? Will we be able to keep our insurance? What are we going to do?\nJoe Biden: (30:14)\nFolks, this election has a choice between Scranton and Park Avenue values, between Cleveland and Park Avenue values, between Alliance and Park Avenue values. But it’s also about something deeper. Can these parents look their kids in the eye and say, ” Honey, everything’s going to be okay.” These are the conversations I’m going to be having today in this whistle stop tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania, talking to folks about how I’ll get the virus under control, lay out the plan, bringing Congress together to provide relief and resources to schools and business so we can reopen our economy safely and strongly with a real plan and real leadership.\nJoe Biden: (30:55)\nTalking to folks about how I’d create good paying jobs, union jobs, to support working families and build our economy back. Not just back, but build it back better. I’ll protect your Medicare and social security and how I’ll fight to protect pensions, including fixing [inaudible 00:31:13] employer pensions so that many union women and men in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Delaware, all across this country, are able to keep what they earned and deserve.\nJoe Biden: (31:26)\nI’ll fight for American jobs with the dignity of work and make the wealthy and corporations began to pay their fair share. I’ll protect your right to healthcare and build on and improve the Affordable Care Act and I’ll always tell you the truth. I’ll always care about you, whether you vote for me or not. If elected, I’m not going to be a Democratic president, I’m going to be an American president. Whether you voted for me or not, I’m going to be your president and I’ll never forget the people, the working people of this country, because that’s what I’ve come from. That, given just half a chance, the American people can do anything. Just like you, Tiffany, and your husband, you’ve stood up. You can do anything. I want to make something absolutely clear. There’s overwhelming reason for optimism. Reverend, as you said, there’s overwhelming reason. We just have to unite. The country is ready to do that. We’re better positioned than any nation in the world to own the 21st century, we just have to do it and do it together. So I leave you Rev and thank you for your invocation by saying, God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Keep the faith. We’re coming back. Thank you.",

         "Chris Wallace: (01:20)\nGood evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates.\nChris Wallace: (02:10)\nThis debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight’s debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden.\nVice President Joe Biden: (02:49)\nHow you doing, man?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (02:51)\nHow are you doing?\nVice President Joe Biden: (02:51)\nI’m well.\nChris Wallace: (03:11)\nGentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let’s get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate’s to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (04:01)\nThank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had. He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (04:53)\nAnd we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they’d try and do it faster. There’s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.\nChris Wallace: (05:22)\nPresident Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes.\nVice President Joe Biden: (05:29)\nWell, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (05:34)\nThank you, Joe.\nVice President Joe Biden: (05:36)\nThe American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.\nVice President Joe Biden: (06:12)\nNow, what’s at stake here is the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He’s been running on that, he ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens? Women’s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.\nVice President Joe Biden: (07:08)\nAnd that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there’s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they’ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (07:34)\nThere aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years. I’m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:01)\nHe’s elected to the next election.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (08:02)\nDuring that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I’m not elected for three years. I’m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don’t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this.\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:24)\nThat’s simply not true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (08:25)\nWell, you’re certainly going to socialist. You’re going to socialist medicine-\nChris Wallace: (08:29)\nGentlemen, we’re now into open discussion.\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:31)\nOpen discussion.\nChris Wallace: (08:32)\nOpen discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President.\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:33)\nNumber one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (08:58)\nThat’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying.\nVice President Joe Biden: (09:00)\nThat is simply a lie.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (09:02)\nYour party doesn’t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.\nVice President Joe Biden: (09:05)\nThe party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (09:08)\nAnd they’re going to dominate you, Joe. You know that.\nVice President Joe Biden: (09:09)\nI am the Democratic Party right now.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (09:11)\nNot according to Harris.\nVice President Joe Biden: (09:12)\nThe platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 20, the 200 mil- the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (09:39)\nJoe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this.\nVice President Joe Biden: (09:47)\nI’m happy to talk about this.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (09:48)\nAnd if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe.\nChris Wallace: (09:58)\nAll right, gentlemen, Mr. President.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (10:00)\nYou would have been much later, Joe, much later.\nChris Wallace: (10:04)\nMr. President.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (10:04)\nWe’re talking about two million people.\nVice President Joe Biden: (10:05)\nYou’re not going to be able to shut him up.\nChris Wallace: (10:06)\nMr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead.\nVice President Joe Biden: (10:11)\nLet me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now. And so the election is all-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (10:25)\nYou don’t know what’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It’s not on the ballot.\nVice President Joe Biden: (10:31)\nIt’s on the ballot in the court.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (10:32)\nI don’t think so.\nVice President Joe Biden: (10:33)\nIn the court.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (10:34)\nThere’s nothing happening there.\nVice President Joe Biden: (10:35)\nDonald would you just be quiet for a minute.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (10:36)\nYou don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know here view.\nChris Wallace: (10:40)\nWell, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade.\nVice President Joe Biden: (10:51)\nAll right.\nChris Wallace: (10:51)\nMr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (11:05)\nThat’s right.\nChris Wallace: (11:05)\nYou have spent the last week-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (11:07)\nBecause they want to give good healthcare.\nChris Wallace: (11:08)\nIf I may ask my question, sir.\nVice President Joe Biden: (11:11)\nGood healthcare.\nChris Wallace: (11:11)\nOver the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (11:25)\nYes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.\nChris Wallace: (11:26)\n[crosstalk 00:11:26] when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (11:28)\nExcuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.\nChris Wallace: (11:31)\nThat’s not a comprehensive place.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (11:32)\nThat is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.\nChris Wallace: (11:35)\nI didn’t ask, sir.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (11:36)\nChris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.\nChris Wallace: (11:38)\nYou’re debating him not me. Let me ask my question.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (11:38)\nWell, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.\nChris Wallace: (11:44)\nMr. President.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (11:44)\nI got rid of it. And we will protect people.\nChris Wallace: (11:46)\nMr. President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (11:52)\nGo ahead.\nChris Wallace: (11:53)\nYou, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (12:16)\nWell, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare.\nChris Wallace: (12:40)\nWhat about pre-existing conditions?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (12:40)\nAll of the things that we’ve done.\nVice President Joe Biden: (12:41)\nHe has not done healthcare.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (12:42)\nI’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.\nChris Wallace: (13:03)\nOkay, like I say, this is open discussion.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (13:04)\nThis is big stuff.\nChris Wallace: (13:06)\nSir, you’ll be happy. I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.\nVice President Joe Biden: (13:17)\nYes.\nChris Wallace: (13:17)\nAnd the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.\nVice President Joe Biden: (13:23)\nIt is not.\nChris Wallace: (13:25)\nIf I start asking the question.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (13:26)\nThat’s not what your party says, by the way.\nChris Wallace: (13:29)\nAnd it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.\nVice President Joe Biden: (13:32)\nIt does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare, excuse me, Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (13:57)\nJoe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:04)\nLook, hey.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:05)\nAre you saying you didn’t agree?\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:06)\nI’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:10)\nNot by much.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:10)\nI beat him by a whole hell of a lot.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:12)\nNot by much.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:12)\nI’m here standing facing you, old buddy.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:14)\nIf Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:17)\nAll he knows how to do-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:18)\nOn Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:21)\nLook he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:23)\nWith what?\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:23)\nAnd tonight I’m going to make sure.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:25)\nWith what?\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:25)\nBecause here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:34)\nBut you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:41)\nGod, I want to make sure-\nChris Wallace: (14:43)\nMr. President, can you let him finish, sir?\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:44)\nNo, he doesn’t know how to do that.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:46)\nYou’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:47)\nThe wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:51)\nListen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:55)\nThere is no manifesto, number one.\nChris Wallace: (14:57)\nPlease let him speak, Mr. President.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:58)\nNumber two.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:58)\nHe just lost the left.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:59)\nNumber two.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:01)\nYou just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk 00:15:10], they call it socialized medicine.\nChris Wallace: (15:13)\nMr. President.\nVice President Joe Biden: (15:14)\nI’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:20)\nWho is, Bernie?\nVice President Joe Biden: (15:21)\nBecause he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:41)\nNo, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.\nVice President Joe Biden: (15:45)\nHe doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:46)\nI’ve already fixed it.\nVice President Joe Biden: (15:47)\nHe has never offered a plan.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:49)\nWe’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good.\nChris Wallace: (15:54)\nGentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:59)\nObamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better.\nChris Wallace: (16:42)\nI understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (16:45)\nGo ahead.\nChris Wallace: (16:45)\nPlease let the Vice President talk, sir.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (16:47)\nGood.\nVice President Joe Biden: (16:48)\nHe has no plan for healthcare.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (16:50)\nOf course, we do.\nChris Wallace: (16:52)\nPlease.\nVice President Joe Biden: (16:52)\nHe sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody. He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn’t have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about. [crosstalk 00:17:14].\nChris Wallace: (17:13)\nAll right, I have one final question for you.\nVice President Joe Biden: (17:15)\nSure.\nChris Wallace: (17:16)\nMr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn’t brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?\nVice President Joe Biden: (17:55)\nWhatever position I take on that, that’ll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You’re voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (18:05)\nAre you going to pack the court?\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:07)\nVote now.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (18:08)\nAre you going to pack the court?\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:09)\nMake sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (18:12)\nHe doesn’t want to answer the question.\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:17)\nI’m not going to answer the question.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (18:18)\nWhy wouldn’t you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:18)\nWill you shut up, man?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (18:20)\nListen, who is on your list, Joe? Who’s on your list?\nChris Wallace: (18:23)\nGentlemen, I think we’ve ended this-\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:25)\nThis is so un-Presidential.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (18:25)\nHe’s going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.\nChris Wallace: (18:27)\nWe have ended the segment. We’re going to move on to the second segment.\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:30)\nThat was really a productive segment, wasn’t it? Keep yapping, man.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (18:35)\nThe people understand, Joe.\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:37)\nThey sure do.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (18:37)\n47 years, you’ve done nothing. They’re understand.\nChris Wallace: (18:40)\nAll right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let’s try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted.\nVice President Joe Biden: (19:33)\nGood luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That’s why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn’t laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people. You don’t panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?\nVice President Joe Biden: (20:30)\nHe went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (20:43)\nWrong.\nVice President Joe Biden: (20:43)\nHe told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn’t have a plan.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (20:57)\nWrong.\nChris Wallace: (20:57)\nSir, it’s his two minutes.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (20:57)\nIt’s so wrong.\nVice President Joe Biden: (20:57)\nI laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:30)\nSo, if we would have listened to you.\nChris Wallace: (21:31)\nWait, wait. You have two minutes, sir.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:31)\nIf we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It’s China’s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic. He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute.\nChris Wallace: (22:06)\nSir, it’s his two minutes.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:07)\nYou didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn’t have made ventilators. And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine. We’re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We’ve done a great job.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:54)\nThe only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It’s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don’t care. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood. You could’ve never done that, Joe.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:15)\nI know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:18)\nWell, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:25)\n14,000 people died, not 200,000.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:27)\nA far less lethal disease, by the way.\nChris Wallace: (23:32)\nSir, you made a point. Let him answer it.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:33)\nAnd there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:57)\nWe would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You’re months behind me, Joe.\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:03)\nHis own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don’t. What we trust is a scientist.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:25)\nYou don’t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?\n \nChris Wallace:\nOkay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I’m going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (00:15)\nWell, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives.\nVice President Joe Biden: (00:22)\nGod.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (00:23)\nIt is a very political thing. I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them.\nChris Wallace: (00:38)\nSo you’re suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (00:42)\nI disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn’t say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago.\nChris Wallace: (00:49)\nHe talked about the summer, sir, before it’s generally available, just like Dr. Redfield.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (00:53)\nBecause he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that.\nChris Wallace: (00:59)\nI’m talking about when it’s generally available, not-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:00)\nWell, we’re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they’re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They’re going to be delivering-\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:11)\nThis is the same man who told you-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:13)\nIt’s all set up.\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:14)\n… by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it’d be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:24)\nThat was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically.\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:28)\nSo here’s the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will.\nChris Wallace: (01:49)\nMr. Vice President, I want to pick up-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:50)\nYou’ll have the vaccine sooner than that.\nChris Wallace: (01:51)\nI want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can’t trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.” Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?\nVice President Joe Biden: (02:18)\nNo more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.\nChris Wallace: (02:25)\nBut you’re saying you can’t-\nVice President Joe Biden: (02:26)\nEverybody knows-\nChris Wallace: (02:26)\nOr Senator Harris is saying you can’t trust the scientist.\nVice President Joe Biden: (02:28)\nWell, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn’t say that. You can trust the-\nChris Wallace: (02:32)\nShe said that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.”\nVice President Joe Biden: (02:36)\nYes. Well, that’s what he’s going to try to do, but there’s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him. Their job doesn’t depend on him. They’re the people… And by the way-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (02:51)\nWe spoke to the scientists that are in charge-\nVice President Joe Biden: (02:53)\nBy the way-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (02:53)\n… they will have the vaccine very soon.\nChris Wallace: (02:55)\nLet him finish.\nVice President Joe Biden: (02:55)\nDo you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn’t even tell you. He’s on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-\nChris Wallace: (03:27)\nMr. President?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (03:28)\nDid you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word.\nVice President Joe Biden: (03:44)\nOh, give me a break.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (03:44)\nBecause you know what? There’s nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you’ve done nothing.\nVice President Joe Biden: (03:49)\nWell, let’s have this debate-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (03:51)\nLet me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast.\nChris Wallace: (04:02)\nWe’ll get to the economy in the next segment, sir.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (04:04)\nOkay. It’s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.\nChris Wallace: (04:06)\nOkay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?\nVice President Joe Biden: (04:31)\nBecause he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is. You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (04:45)\nTell that to Nancy Pelosi.\nVice President Joe Biden: (04:47)\nWill he just shush for a minute?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (04:49)\nTell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk 00:04:52] Chuck.\nVice President Joe Biden: (04:52)\nNancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won’t even meet with them. The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (05:04)\nYou probably play more than I do, Joe.\nChris Wallace: (05:06)\nWhat about this question of reopenings and the fact-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (05:08)\nWell, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-\nVice President Joe Biden: (05:15)\nYou just admitted you’d shut it down.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (05:15)\nWait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd.\nChris Wallace: (05:54)\nAll right. I want to move onto another-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (05:55)\nBecause it’s a political thing.\nChris Wallace: (05:55)\nI want to move onto another subject.\nVice President Joe Biden: (05:55)\nI got to respond to that.\nChris Wallace: (05:55)\nI want to move-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (05:57)\nBut those states-\nChris Wallace: (05:58)\nGentlemen, I want to move onto another subject.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (06:00)\nThose states are not doing well that are shut down right now.\nVice President Joe Biden: (06:02)\nI got to respond to that.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (06:04)\nHe wants to shut down the whole country.\nChris Wallace: (06:04)\nPresident Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (06:20)\nNo, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-\nVice President Joe Biden: (06:33)\nJust like your rally.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (06:33)\n… when needed. When needed, I wear masks.\nChris Wallace: (06:35)\nOkay. Let me ask-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (06:36)\nI don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. I will say this-\nChris Wallace: (06:45)\nVice President Biden, go ahead, sir.\nVice President Joe Biden: (06:48)\nLook, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. We provided money, the-\nChris Wallace: (06:55)\nBut I was asking you, sir, about masks.\nVice President Joe Biden: (06:56)\nWell, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (07:10)\nAnd they’ve also said the opposite. They’ve also said-\nVice President Joe Biden: (07:12)\nNo serious person has said the opposite. No serious person.\nChris Wallace: (07:14)\nOkay. I want to ask you-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (07:17)\nDr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite.\nVice President Joe Biden: (07:18)\nHe did not say the opposite.\nChris Wallace: (07:19)\nI want to ask you, we’ve got a little than a minute left in this segment.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (07:22)\nHe said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind. He said, “Masks are good.”\nChris Wallace: (07:25)\nI want to ask-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (07:25)\nI’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks.\nChris Wallace: (07:27)\nI want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (07:38)\nOutside.\nChris Wallace: (07:39)\nOutside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (07:46)\nBecause nobody will show up.\nChris Wallace: (07:47)\n… people with masks.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (07:47)\nWell, it’s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies.\nChris Wallace: (07:50)\nAll right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (07:56)\nBecause people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-\nChris Wallace: (07:59)\nBut are not worried about us spreading disease?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (08:01)\n… I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-\nChris Wallace: (08:06)\nAre you not worried about the disease issues, sir?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (08:08)\nWell, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace.\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:26)\nBy the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you. He’s not worried about the people out there [crosstalk 00:08:48].\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (08:48)\nWe’ve had no negative effect.\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:49)\nNo negative effect. Come on.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (08:51)\nWe’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies.\nChris Wallace: (08:55)\nAll right. Do you want to just quickly finish up? Because I want to move on to our next-\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:57)\nYes, I would. He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He’s a fool on this.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (09:08)\nIf you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares.\nChris Wallace: (09:12)\nGentlemen, can we move on to the-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (09:13)\nNo cares.\nChris Wallace: (09:13)\nGentlemen, can we move on to the economy?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (09:15)\nYes.\nChris Wallace: (09:15)\nThe economy is, I think it’s fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (09:22)\nMuch faster.\nChris Wallace: (09:22)\n… in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it’s more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (09:52)\nSo we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (10:31)\nA lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (11:04)\nWhen you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.”\nChris Wallace: (11:36)\nAll right. Your two minutes, sir. We’re now moved to you. As I said, posing the question, the president says it’s a V-shape recovery, you say it’s a K-shaped recovery. What’s the difference?\nVice President Joe Biden: (11:48)\nThe difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (12:17)\nThat’s wrong.\nChris Wallace: (12:18)\nSir, wait. No. Sir-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (12:18)\n[crosstalk 00:12:19].\nChris Wallace: (12:20)\nYeah, I understand. You’ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it.\nVice President Joe Biden: (12:23)\nDo I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history.\nVice President Joe Biden: (12:40)\nSecondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety.\nVice President Joe Biden: (13:25)\nSchools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely.\nChris Wallace: (13:54)\nAll right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (13:56)\nI have to respond to that.\nChris Wallace: (13:57)\nWell, you both had two minutes, sir.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (13:59)\nExcuse me, he made a statement.\nChris Wallace: (14:01)\nAnd so did you.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:03)\nNo, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:19)\nPeople want to be safe.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:20)\nThey’ll be careful, but they want their schools open.\nVice President Joe Biden: (14:22)\nPeople want to be safe.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:23)\nI’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it-\nChris Wallace: (14:30)\nAll right. Let’s-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (14:31)\n… and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk 00:14:35].\nChris Wallace: (14:36)\nGentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, Mr. President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:08)\nI paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-\nVice President Joe Biden: (15:16)\nShow us your tax returns.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:17)\nI paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year.\nVice President Joe Biden: (15:24)\nShow us your tax returns.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:24)\nYou’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company.\nChris Wallace: (15:42)\nSir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:43)\nBut let me tell you-\nChris Wallace: (15:43)\nI understand all of that.\nVice President Joe Biden: (15:44)\nRelease your tax return.\nChris Wallace: (15:45)\nI understand all of that-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:45)\nLet me-\nChris Wallace: (15:47)\nNo, Mr. President, I’m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:56)\nMillions of dollars.\nChris Wallace: (15:58)\nYou paid millions of dollars in-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (15:59)\nMillions of dollars, yes.\nChris Wallace: (15:59)\nSo not 750?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (16:00)\nMillions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it.\nVice President Joe Biden: (16:03)\nWhen? Inshallah?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (16:04)\nBut let me just tell you-\nVice President Joe Biden: (16:05)\nIn [crosstalk 00:16:04]?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (16:05)\nChris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-\nChris Wallace: (16:40)\nVice President Biden, you want to respond?\nVice President Joe Biden: (16:42)\nYeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (17:06)\nThat’s okay.\nVice President Joe Biden: (17:07)\nAnd make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (17:13)\nBut why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?\nVice President Joe Biden: (17:16)\nBecause you weren’t president-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (17:18)\nWhy didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?\nVice President Joe Biden: (17:19)\nBecause you weren’t president and screwing things up.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (17:20)\nYou were a Senator and [crosstalk 00:17:21]-\nVice President Joe Biden: (17:21)\nYou’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (17:24)\nHey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing.\nChris Wallace: (17:33)\nOkay. Gentlemen?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (17:33)\nIncluding fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts.\nChris Wallace: (17:38)\nMr. President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (17:46)\nHe has none.\nChris Wallace: (17:47)\n… if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year.\nChris Wallace: (18:03)\n… on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession.\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:13)\nWell, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-\nChris Wallace: (18:50)\nBut respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending.\nVice President Joe Biden: (18:53)\nBy the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (19:09)\nWhy didn’t you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama?\nVice President Joe Biden: (19:12)\nBecause you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (19:16)\nI got it done. And you know what happened?\nVice President Joe Biden: (19:17)\nYeah, you got it done-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (19:18)\nOur economy boomed like it’s never boomed before.\nVice President Joe Biden: (19:20)\nThe economy-\nChris Wallace: (19:20)\nMr. President-\nVice President Joe Biden: (19:22)\nLet me finish.\nChris Wallace: (19:23)\nMr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?\nVice President Joe Biden: (19:31)\nNot lower tax for the American people.\nChris Wallace: (19:34)\nBut let me-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (19:34)\nExcuse me.\nChris Wallace: (19:34)\nYou talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (19:47)\nThey had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places. [crosstalk 00:20:25] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen.\nVice President Joe Biden: (20:29)\nLook-\nChris Wallace: (20:29)\nMr. Vice President.\nVice President Joe Biden: (20:30)\n… we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (20:44)\nIt wasn’t blooming.\nVice President Joe Biden: (20:45)\nHe blew it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (20:46)\nHe was in booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.\nChris Wallace: (20:50)\nWait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (20:53)\nWhen COVID came along.\nChris Wallace: (20:54)\n… when there was record low unemployment before COVID.\nVice President Joe Biden: (20:57)\nYeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:04)\nExcuse me, Chris, wait.\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:05)\n… number one. Number two-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:06)\nChris.\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:06)\nNumber three.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:07)\nThey said it would take… No, you’re on number two.\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:09)\nNo.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:10)\nChris, Chris. They said it would take-\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:12)\nThis guy-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:12)\n… a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing.\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:20)\nWe did not. [crosstalk 00:21:21]\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:21)\n… standard fare.\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:22)\nI’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:25)\nHe totally gave up on manufacturing.\nChris Wallace: (21:25)\nAll right, let him-\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:25)\nI was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:34)\nOhio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had.\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:40)\nThat is not true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (21:41)\nMany car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. [crosstalk 00:21:47].\nChris Wallace: (21:47)\nMr. Vice President, go ahead.\nVice President Joe Biden: (21:48)\nAnd so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:06)\nChina ate your lunch- [crosstalk 00:00:22:07].\nVice President Joe Biden: (22:08)\n… with Mexico.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:09)\nChina ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars?\nVice President Joe Biden: (22:28)\nThat is not true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:28)\nWhat did he do to deserve it? What did he do with-\nVice President Joe Biden: (22:31)\nNone of that is true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:31)\n… to deserve $183,000?\nChris Wallace: (22:31)\nSir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it.\nVice President Joe Biden: (22:37)\nNone of that is true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:38)\nOh really, he didn’t get three and a half million?\nChris Wallace: (22:39)\nMr. President-\nVice President Joe Biden: (22:40)\nIs totally-\nChris Wallace: (22:41)\nMr. President, please. You’ve asked a question- [crosstalk 00:22:41]\nVice President Joe Biden: (22:41)\nTotally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:45)\nWell wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe?\nVice President Joe Biden: (22:48)\nMr. Vice-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:48)\nHe got three and a half million-\nChris Wallace: (22:49)\nMr. President.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:49)\n… dollars.\nVice President Joe Biden: (22:50)\nThat is not true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:51)\nOh, really?\nChris Wallace: (22:51)\nMr. President, it’s an open discussion. Please- [crosstalk 00:22:56]\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (22:56)\nIt’s a fact.\nVice President Joe Biden: (22:57)\nIt is not a fact.\nChris Wallace: (22:57)\nWell, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:00)\nIt’s been totally discredited.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:01)\nDid Burisma pay him 183,000 a month, with no experience in energy?\nChris Wallace: (23:06)\nMr. President-\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:07)\nMy son did nothing wrong at Barisma-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:10)\nI think he did.\nChris Wallace: (23:10)\nMr. President, let him answer. [crosstalk 00:23:13].\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:11)\nHe doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:20)\nBy who?\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:20)\nAnd you can-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:20)\nThe media.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:20)\nby everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:23)\nBy the media, because they refuse to talk about it-\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:23)\nBy the World Bank-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:24)\n… because they’re embarrassed.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:27)\nBy everyone, has discredited. And matter of fact [crosstalk 00:23:30] Matter of fact-\nChris Wallace: (23:30)\nMr. President, please stop.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:31)\nEven the people who testified under oath-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:33)\nSo let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk 00:23:35].\nChris Wallace: (23:36)\nGo ahead, I’m listening to you.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:37)\nEven the people under-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:38)\nHe got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:40)\n… testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:47)\nOh, really?\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:47)\nI did it honorably.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:47)\nI’d like to know who they are.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:48)\nWell, I’ll give you the list of the people who-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:50)\nI’ll fire them.\nChris Wallace: (23:50)\nNo, no. Go ahead, sir.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:51)\nI’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (23:54)\nSome people don’t do a good job.\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:55)\nWell, here’s the- [crosstalk 00:23:57]\nChris Wallace: (23:57)\nGo ahead. You get the- [crosstalk 00:23:57] Wait a minute. You get the final word, Mr.-\nVice President Joe Biden: (23:59)\nWell, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:02)\nHey, let me just tell you, Joe-\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:03)\nNo, no. Mr. President- [crosstalk 00:24:05]\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:04)\nThree and a half million, Joe.\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:06)\nThat is simply not true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:07)\nWhy did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:09)\nLook, here’s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don’t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family’s already-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:19)\nMy family-\nChris Wallace: (24:20)\nNo, no- [crosstalk 00:06:20].\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:20)\nMy family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance.\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:24)\nAnd that’s such a- [crosstalk 00:24:25]\nChris Wallace: (24:25)\nMr. President-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:26)\nEvery single one of them lost a fortune-\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:27)\nThis is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people. [crosstalk 00:24:32] That’s not true. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people, it’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here. [crosstalk 00:24:42]\nChris Wallace: (24:43)\nThat’s the end of the segment. We’re moving on.\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:46)\nHe didn’t take that.\nChris Wallace: (24:47)\nVice President-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:47)\nChris, can I be honest? It’s a very important question-\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:49)\nTry to be honest.\nChris Wallace: (24:50)\nNo.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:50)\nHe stood up-\nChris Wallace: (24:52)\nThe answer to the question is no.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:53)\n… and the threatened Ukraine-\nChris Wallace: (24:55)\nSir-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (24:55)\n… with a billion dollars-\nVice President Joe Biden: (24:57)\nThat is absolutely not true.\nChris Wallace: (25:01)\nStop. [crosstalk 00:25:02] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk 00:25:05] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here’s the deal.\nVice President Joe Biden: (25:09)\nThat’s a good point.\nChris Wallace: (25:09)\nWe have six segments. We have ended that segment. We’re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (25:37)\nWell, and him too.\nChris Wallace: (25:38)\nWell, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (25:40)\nWell, that’s all right, but he does plenty.\nChris Wallace: (25:41)\nWell, sir, less than-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (25:43)\nHe does plenty.\nChris Wallace: (25:43)\nNo, less than you have. Let’s please continue on. The issue of rice. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (26:05)\nOh yeah, sure.\nChris Wallace: (26:06)\nPresident Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (26:16)\nThat’s true.\nChris Wallace: (26:16)\nMy question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.\nVice President Joe Biden: (26:29)\nIt’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that. [crosstalk 00:27:10].\nChris Wallace: (27:11)\nIt is his-\nVice President Joe Biden: (27:12)\nNow-\nChris Wallace: (27:12)\n… minute sir.\nVice President Joe Biden: (27:13)\n… second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division.\nVice President Joe Biden: (27:50)\nThis is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man’s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (28:27)\nSo-\nChris Wallace: (28:28)\nPresident Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (28:34)\nYou did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it.\nVice President Joe Biden: (28:43)\nI’ve never said-\nChris Wallace: (28:44)\nNo, no, sir. It’s his two minutes.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (28:45)\nSo you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.”\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (29:39)\nI don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it.\nChris Wallace: (30:35)\nAll right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America.” Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?\nVice President Joe Biden: (30:59)\nYes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out.\nVice President Joe Biden: (31:38)\nWe’re going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.\nChris Wallace: (32:04)\nAll right, Mr.-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (32:05)\nWhat is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-\nChris Wallace: (32:08)\nPresident Trump-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (32:09)\n… and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk 00:32:14].\nVice President Joe Biden: (32:11)\nThat is not peaceful protest.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (32:13)\nNo it’s not, but you say it is.\nChris Wallace: (32:15)\nPresident Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (32:21)\nFine.\nChris Wallace: (32:21)\nThis month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (32:42)\nI ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it- [crosstalk 00:33:02]\nChris Wallace: (33:02)\nWhat is radical about racial sensitivity training?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (33:05)\nIf you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen.\nChris Wallace: (33:38)\nVice President Biden.\nVice President Joe Biden: (33:39)\nNobody’s doing that. He’s the racist.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (33:42)\nYou just don’t know.\nVice President Joe Biden: (33:43)\nHere’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk 00:15:43].\nChris Wallace: (33:45)\nLet him finish.\nVice President Joe Biden: (33:47)\nThe fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American.\nChris Wallace: (34:41)\nVice President… I mean, President Trump, sir.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (34:43)\nDuring the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very… Many places, look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened… Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now.\nVice President Joe Biden: (35:01)\nOh my Lord.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (35:01)\nBut the reason-\nVice President Joe Biden: (35:02)\nThis is ridiculous.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (35:03)\n… is that the Democrats that run these cities-\nVice President Joe Biden: (35:05)\nAbsolutely ridiculous.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (35:06)\n… don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order.\nVice President Joe Biden: (35:08)\nViolent crime-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (35:09)\nAnd you still haven’t mentioned. Are you in favor of law and order?\nVice President Joe Biden: (35:12)\nI’m in favor of law. You- [crosstalk 00:35:15].\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (35:14)\nAre you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk 00:35:17]\nChris Wallace: (35:16)\nYou asked a question, let him finish. [crosstalk 00:35:18] Let him answer.\nVice President Joe Biden: (35:20)\nLaw and order with justice, where people get treated fairly.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (35:23)\nOkay.\nVice President Joe Biden: (35:24)\nAnd the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. It’s gone up on his watch.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (35:31)\nIt went down much more in ours.\nChris Wallace: (35:33)\nAll right, we’re done- [crosstalk 00:35:35] Mr. President, you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (35:41)\nThe places we had trouble were democratic run cities-\nChris Wallace: (35:44)\nThat’s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a…\nChris Wallace: (36:03)\nIt’s like Tulsa and Fort worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (36:05)\nI think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before.\nVice President Joe Biden: (36:45)\nHe wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (36:47)\nOh, I know suburbs so much that you.\nChris Wallace: (36:48)\nGentlemen wait a minute.\nVice President Joe Biden: (36:50)\nI was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble.\nChris Wallace: (37:23)\nI do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support? If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing?\nVice President Joe Biden: (37:54)\nLook, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be…\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (38:35)\nThat’s not what they are talking about this. That’s not what it is about. He’s talking about defunding the police.\nVice President Joe Biden: (38:39)\nThat is not true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (38:40)\nHe doesn’t have any law support. He has no law enforcement.\nVice President Joe Biden: (38:45)\nThat’s not true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (38:45)\nHe has almost nothing. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think we have time.\nVice President Joe Biden: (38:54)\nWe don’t have time to do anything.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (38:55)\nNo, no think right now. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you.\nChris Wallace: (39:00)\nNow, gentleman. I think I’m going to tell I’m going to take back the bottom line.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (39:03)\nThere aren’t any.\nChris Wallace: (39:04)\nAnd I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.”\nVice President Joe Biden: (39:50)\nI don’t hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted.\nChris Wallace: (40:02)\nBut you’ve never called for the people…\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (40:02)\nHe’s never done that.\nChris Wallace: (40:02)\nExcuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots.\nVice President Joe Biden: (40:15)\nThey can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (40:19)\nOh really? I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn’t do anything. I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.\nChris Wallace: (40:33)\nGo ahead sir.\nVice President Joe Biden: (40:34)\nAnd by the way his own former spokesperson said, “Riots and chaos and violence help he cause.” That’s what this is all about.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (40:43)\nI don’t know who said that.\nVice President Joe Biden: (40:44)\nI do.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (40:45)\nWho?\nVice President Joe Biden: (40:46)\nI think Kellyanne Conway.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (40:48)\nI don’t think she said that.\nVice President Joe Biden: (40:48)\nShe said that.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (40:49)\nI don’t think so.\nVice President Joe Biden: (40:50)\nHere’s the point, the point is that that’s why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time.\nChris Wallace: (41:10)\nOkay. And to end this, button up this segment I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly criticized…\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (41:16)\nDoes it mean I have to answer his stuff.\nChris Wallace: (41:17)\nYou have repeatedly…\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (41:18)\nWait a second, you have made a statement.\nChris Wallace: (41:19)\nYou’ve been talking back and forth. I’m asking you.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (41:22)\nI would love to end it.\nChris Wallace: (41:24)\nYou know sir if you want to switch seats we could very quickly can do that.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (41:28)\nI’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But I don’t want to accept the National Guard.\nChris Wallace: (41:33)\nYou have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (41:57)\nSure, I’m will to do that.\nChris Wallace: (41:59)\nAre you prepared specifically to do it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (42:00)\nI would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing.\nChris Wallace: (42:04)\nBut what are you saying?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (42:06)\nI’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.\nChris Wallace: (42:08)\nWell, do it, sir.\nVice President Joe Biden: (42:09)\nSay it, do it say it.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (42:10)\nWhat do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn.\nChris Wallace: (42:14)\nWhite supremacist and right-wing militia.\nVice President Joe Biden: (42:14)\nProud Boys.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (42:18)\nProud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing…\nVice President Joe Biden: (42:28)\nHis own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (42:35)\nOh you got to be kidding me.\nVice President Joe Biden: (42:36)\n… not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (42:41)\nWell, then you know what, he’s wrong.\nChris Wallace: (42:42)\nWe’re done, sir. Moving onto the next… [crosstalk 00:42:46]\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (42:46)\nAntifa is bad.\nVice President Joe Biden: (42:47)\nEvery body in your administration tells you the truth, it’s a bad idea. You have no idea about anything.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (42:53)\nYou know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group.\nChris Wallace: (42:56)\nAll right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump-Biden record.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (42:58)\nAnd you ought to be careful of them, they’ll over throw you.\nChris Wallace: (43:00)\nI’m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you’d like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (43:30)\nBecause there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (44:03)\nAnd by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military. And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (45:05)\nWhen you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record.\nChris Wallace: (45:34)\nLooking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to president Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.\nVice President Joe Biden: (45:42)\nUnder this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (46:14)\nYou son got three and a half million dollars.\nVice President Joe Biden: (46:17)\nBy the way, my son…\nChris Wallace: (46:19)\nWait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers, uninterrupted. Well, you’re a side agreed to it and why don’t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?\nVice President Joe Biden: (46:33)\nHe never keeps his word.\nChris Wallace: (46:34)\nNo, that was a rhetorical question.\nVice President Joe Biden: (46:37)\nCan you get back 30 seconds?\nChris Wallace: (46:39)\nYes. You may have, go ahead.\nVice President Joe Biden: (46:42)\nSo thirdly, we’re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (47:39)\nReally?\nVice President Joe Biden: (47:39)\nAnd I resent-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (47:40)\nAre you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter.\nVice President Joe Biden: (47:42)\nI’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (47:44)\nI don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged.\nVice President Joe Biden: (47:51)\nThat’s not true he was not dishonorably discharged.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (47:53)\nFor cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became vice president.\nVice President Joe Biden: (47:56)\nNone of that is true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (47:56)\nOnce you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places.\nVice President Joe Biden: (48:01)\nThat is not true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (48:04)\nHe made a fortune and he didn’t have a job.\nVice President Joe Biden: (48:07)\nMy son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He’s overtaking it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him, I’m proud of my son.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (48:17)\nBut why was he given tens of millions of dollars?\nVice President Joe Biden: (48:19)\nHe wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk 00:48:23] It was all discredited.\nChris Wallace: (48:27)\nWe’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (48:35)\nI know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow.\nVice President Joe Biden: (48:39)\nThat is not true. That report is totally discredited.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (48:43)\nWhy did he get it?\nVice President Joe Biden: (48:45)\nMitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money. That report was written for political reason.\nChris Wallace: (48:50)\nI’d like to talk about climate change.\nVice President Joe Biden: (48:52)\nSo would I.\nChris Wallace: (48:53)\nOkay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change. Mr. President, you said, I don’t think the science knows. Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (49:27)\nI want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven’t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren’t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You’ve got to have forest management.\nChris Wallace: (50:09)\nWhat do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (50:13)\nI believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good. We’re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people.\nChris Wallace: (50:25)\nYou believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (50:32)\nI think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California’s burning, California’s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they’re forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city. He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it. I’m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management.\nChris Wallace: (51:25)\nBut sir if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed…?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (51:35)\nBecause it was driving energy prices through the sky.\nVice President Joe Biden: (51:38)\nWhy have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (51:44)\nWell, not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500.\nChris Wallace: (52:06)\nBut in the case of California they have simply ignored that.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (52:08)\nNo, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, by the way, we’re going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I’m okay with electric cars too. I think I’m all for electric cars. I’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in California is just crazy.\nChris Wallace: (52:34)\nAll right, Vice president Biden. I’d like you to respond to the president’s climate change record but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.\nVice President Joe Biden: (53:03)\nHe’s absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody’s going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America. They’re going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future. We’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do…\nVice President Joe Biden: (54:03)\nGas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what’s happening. It’s all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, “Here’s $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences.”\nChris Wallace: (55:11)\nWhat about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests? And he’s drawn his line.\nVice President Joe Biden: (55:21)\nWell, he hasn’t drawn a line. He wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, the fact that-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (55:39)\nNot true. Not true-\nVice President Joe Biden: (55:40)\nIt’s all true. And here’s the deal-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (55:42)\nHe’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it’s not 2 billion [crosstalk 00:55:45] or 20 billion, as you said [crosstalk 00:55:46]. It’s $100 trillion.\nVice President Joe Biden: (55:49)\nI’m talking about the Biden plan [crosstalk 00:55:51]-\nChris Wallace: (55:50)\nLet him go for a minute, and then you can go.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (55:52)\nAnd rebuild the building.\nVice President Joe Biden: (55:53)\nNo.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (55:53)\nIt’s the dumbest-\nVice President Joe Biden: (55:54)\nThat is not-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (55:54)\n… most ridiculous [crosstalk 00:55:56] where two car systems are out-\nVice President Joe Biden: (55:59)\nNot true-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (56:00)\n… where they want to take out the cows too.\nVice President Joe Biden: (56:01)\nNot true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (56:01)\nThat’s not true either, right?\nVice President Joe Biden: (56:03)\nNot true.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (56:04)\nThis is a 100 trillion-\nVice President Joe Biden: (56:06)\nSimply… Look-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (56:06)\nThat’s more money than our country could make in 100 years [crosstalk 00:02:10]-\nVice President Joe Biden: (56:09)\nThat is simply not the case-\nChris Wallace: (56:14)\nAll right. Let me [crosstalk 00:02:12]. Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, the president is saying, I think some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.\nVice President Joe Biden: (56:38)\nWhat it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs [crosstalk 00:02:41].\nChris Wallace: (56:42)\nLet him finish, sir.\nVice President Joe Biden: (56:43)\nHe doesn’t know how to do that-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (56:45)\n100 million dollars.\nVice President Joe Biden: (56:46)\nThe fact is, it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with… By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (57:05)\nI never said that at all-\nVice President Joe Biden: (57:06)\nYeah, he did say that-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (57:06)\nThey made it up.\nVice President Joe Biden: (57:08)\nAnd here’s the deal-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (57:09)\nYou make up a lot-\nVice President Joe Biden: (57:10)\n… we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We’re in real trouble. Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn’t happen before. They’re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world’s problem. But the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along. That’s why we have to get back into the Paris Accord.\nChris Wallace: (57:52)\nAll right, gentlemen-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (57:52)\nWait a minute, Chris. So why didn’t he do it for 47 years? You were vice president-\nVice President Joe Biden: (57:56)\nFor 47-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (57:56)\nSo why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars.\nVice President Joe Biden: (58:08)\nThat is not my plan [crosstalk 00:58:10]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk 00:58:14] is not my plan. [crosstalk 00:58:15]-\nChris Wallace: (58:15)\nGentlemen-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (58:16)\nHe made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it.\nChris Wallace: (58:23)\nOkay. [crosstalk 00:58:24] Mr. Vice President-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (58:28)\nHe called the military stupid bastards.\nVice President Joe Biden: (58:28)\nI did not say that-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (58:31)\nHe said it on tape. [crosstalk 00:58:32]-\nChris Wallace: (58:31)\nPlease, sir. [crosstalk 00:58:33] Stop.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (58:34)\nI would never say that [crosstalk 00:58:35]-\nVice President Joe Biden: (58:35)\nPlay it. Play it-\nChris Wallace: (58:36)\nStop. Go ahead-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (58:37)\nYou’re on tape-\nChris Wallace: (58:38)\nMr. Vice President answered his final question.\nVice President Joe Biden: (58:41)\nThe final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings [crosstalk 00:04:44].\nChris Wallace: (58:44)\nI’m having a little trouble myself, but…\nVice President Joe Biden: (58:47)\nYeah.\nChris Wallace: (58:48)\nAnd about the economy and about this question of what it’s going to cost.\nVice President Joe Biden: (58:52)\nThe economy-\nChris Wallace: (58:53)\nThe Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do-\nVice President Joe Biden: (58:57)\nThe Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants-\nChris Wallace: (59:05)\nSo, do you support the Green New Deal?\nVice President Joe Biden: (59:07)\nPardon me?\nChris Wallace: (59:08)\nDo you support the-\nVice President Joe Biden: (59:08)\nNo, I don’t support the Green New Deal.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (59:10)\nOh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement.\nVice President Joe Biden: (59:12)\nI support [crosstalk 00:05:13]-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (59:13)\nYou just lost the radical left.\nVice President Joe Biden: (59:15)\nI support [crosstalk 00:59:17] the Biden plan that I put forward.\nChris Wallace: (59:19)\nOkay.\nVice President Joe Biden: (59:19)\nThe Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal.\nChris Wallace: (59:24)\nAll right, gentlemen, final segment, election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first.\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:00:02)\nPrepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate.\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:00:55)\nShow up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will… He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not… When the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that’ll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He’s going to go. He can’t stay in power. It won’t happen. It won’t happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?\nChris Wallace: (01:01:52)\nMr. President, two minutes.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:01:53)\nSo when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught them. We’ve caught them all. We’ve got it all on tape. We’ve caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:02:35)\nHe knew about it too. So don’t tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You’re soliciting. You’re asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited… They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen. The other thing, it’s nice. On November 3rd, you’re watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:03:22)\nBut you know what? We won’t know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. It’s a fraud, and it’s a shame. And can you imagine where they say, “You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.” November 10th. That’s seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states [crosstalk 01:03:58] with that-\nChris Wallace: (01:03:58)\nSir.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:03:58)\n… all run by Democrats-\nChris Wallace: (01:03:59)\nTwo minutes is two minutes.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:04:00)\nAll run by Democrats.\nChris Wallace: (01:04:02)\nPresident Trump-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:04:02)\nIt’s a rigged election.\nChris Wallace: (01:04:04)\nYou’re going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it’s rigged [crosstalk 00:01:04:11], that it’s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:04:38)\nYeah. I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don’t like them. We don’t like them. They throw them out-\nChris Wallace: (01:04:59)\nBut what are you going to do about it-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:04:59)\n… left and right.\nChris Wallace: (01:05:00)\nThere are millions of ballots going out right now. What are you going to do-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:05:02)\nWhat you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that’s okay-\nChris Wallace: (01:05:05)\nNo. No. I know your complaint [crosstalk 01:05:05]. I’m asking you about the fact that millions of people have received-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:05:08)\nYou go and vote. You go and vote-\nChris Wallace: (01:05:11)\nNo. But what I’m saying is [crosstalk 01:05:11], what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:05:14)\nYou either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what’s going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They’re being sold. They’re being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country.\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:05:30)\nThere is no [crosstalk 01:05:32]… There is no evidence of that-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:05:33)\nThis is not going to end well.\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:05:34)\nThere is no evidence of that-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:05:34)\nThis is not going to end well-\nChris Wallace: (01:05:37)\nOkay. Vice President Biden, in fact, go ahead, sir-\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:05:37)\nFive states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don’t have to solicit the ballot. It’s sent to you. It’s sent to your home. What they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:06:03)\nYou’re wrong. You’re wrong [crosstalk 01:06:04]. I love counting the votes [crosstalk 01:06:05]-\nChris Wallace: (01:06:05)\nI want to continue with you on this [crosstalk 01:06:06] Vice President Biden-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:06:07)\nChris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that-\nChris Wallace: (01:06:09)\nNo. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:06:36)\nI am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you. That is totally legitimate.\nChris Wallace: (01:07:09)\nAll right.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:07:10)\nExcuse me [crosstalk 01:07:11]-\nChris Wallace: (01:07:12)\nNo. No. No. I have a final [crosstalk 00:13:12]. Gentlemen, I have a final question [crosstalk 01:07:14]-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:07:15)\nYou know it can’t be done. You know it can’t, and already, there’s been fraud [crosstalk 01:07:19]-\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:07:19)\nMail service delivers [crosstalk 01:07:21] 185 million pieces of mail a day [crosstalk 01:07:24]-\nChris Wallace: (01:07:24)\nWe can keep talking. In eight states, [crosstalk 01:07:27] election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day. That means that it’s likely, because there’s going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days. It could be weeks-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:07:50)\nCould be months-\nChris Wallace: (01:07:50)\n… until we find out who the new president is. First for you, sir. Finally, for the vice president, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:08:16)\nI’m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging my people. I hope it’s going to be a fair election. If it’s a fair election-\nChris Wallace: (01:08:44)\nYou’re urging them what?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:08:45)\n… I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that. And I’ll tell you why-\nChris Wallace: (01:08:53)\nWhat does that mean, not go along-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:08:53)\n… from a common sense-\nChris Wallace: (01:08:54)\nDoes that mean you’re going to tell your people-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:08:55)\nI’ll tell you what it means-\nChris Wallace: (01:08:55)\n… to take to the streets?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:08:56)\nIt means you have a fraudulent election. You’re sending out 80 million ballots-\nChris Wallace: (01:09:00)\nAnd what would you do about that?\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:09:01)\nThey’re not equipped… These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them.\nChris Wallace: (01:09:17)\nVice President Biden-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:09:17)\nYou think that’s good?\nChris Wallace: (01:09:18)\nVice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:09:30)\nYes. And here’s the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day. And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military… They’ve been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that’s what’s going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It’s the same process. It’s honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it’s a fraudulent process.\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:10:07)\nIt’s already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney’s race-\nChris Wallace: (01:10:10)\nI asked you. You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk 01:10:13]. Go ahead [crosstalk 01:10:14]. Vice President Biden, go ahead.\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:10:15)\nHe has no idea what he’s talking about. Here’s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it. That’ll be the end of it. And if it’s me, in fact, fine. If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome. And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:10:41)\nI want to see an honest ballot cut-\nChris Wallace: (01:10:43)\nGentlemen, just say that’s the end of it [crosstalk 01:10:45]. This is the end of this debate-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:10:47)\nI want to see an honest ballot count.\nChris Wallace: (01:10:48)\nWe’re going to leave it there-\nPresident Donald J. Trump: (01:10:49)\nAnd I think he does too-\nChris Wallace: (01:10:50)\n… to be continued in more debates as we go on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it’s been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9:00 PM Eastern that night. We hope you watch. Until then, thank you, and good night.

         "La’Meshia Whittington: (00:00)\n… President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris. To God be the glory.\nDevonte Wilson: (00:20)\nGood to see you, Senator. Good to see you. [inaudible 00:00:21]\nLa’Meshia Whittington: (00:30)\nGood afternoon. Good afternoon. So I guess we’ll begin. Good afternoon and welcome. My name is La’Meshia Whittington, or as many know me, as LA. And I’ll be your co-moderator for this afternoon’s brief Q&A. I am the deputy director of a statewide voting rights organization, a descendant of the kingdom of the happy land, hailing in the Blue Ridge Mountains, and above all, a Black woman hailing from the great state of North Carolina. All right, so I’ll pass it over to my co-moderator.\nDevonte Wilson: (00:59)\nWell, hello everybody. My name is Devonte Wilson, and I hail from the Piney Woods of Eastwood, North Carolina. I currently serve as the 75th president of the Young Democrats of North Carolina. We are the founding state of the Young Democrats of America. And I also have the wonderful opportunity of serving as a middle school educator. Shout out to Southern Middle, home of the dragons. And I’m so thankful to be here. And Senator Harris, we want to kick off to you for opening remarks.\nKamala Harris: (01:24)\nThank you. Thank you. Well, first of all, I just want to thank everybody for your leadership, for your friendship, and for your time. To the White family, thank you for hosting us. This historic, this legendary business that you have been running as a family for 53 years, we spoke earlier, and this is just true of so many of our businesses, but in particular, this business, which is that our business leaders are, they are leaders in business, but they’re so much more than that. They are civic leaders, community leaders, role models, the people who nurture and who take care of the community, and create a warm and safe place for folks to go. And there’s nothing like going to the barbershop to know what’s really happening. I always say to my team, “Okay, that’s fine. You can talk about polls. You can talk about this and you can talk about that. What are folks in the barbershop talking about?” Because that’s about real talk.\nKamala Harris: (02:25)\nSo I want to thank you all for the honor of having us here today on behalf of myself and Joe Biden. GK, did he leave already, and Alma Adams? I want to thank the two incredible, not only North Carolinian leaders, but United States leaders. We serve together in the United States Congress. We are all members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and they, each of them, are powerful, powerful voices, not only for the people of North Carolina, but for all people in our country, so I want to in their absence thank them. They greeted me earlier. Councilman Corey Branch, I want to thank. There you are. Thank you for your leadership, and so many others.\nKamala Harris: (03:08)\nSo listen, I wanted to be here in Raleigh and North Carolina as one of the first trips that I’ve taken now officially on the ticket as the vice presidential nominee, because one, I love North Carolina, and it’s so great to come back. But two, there is so much about what happens in North Carolina as a bellwether, as a measure for what’s going on in our country, both in terms of its historical strengths, but also in terms of the challenges. The other thing we know about North Carolina is this. North Carolina is a road to the White House. There is no question about that. North Carolina is a road to reaching majority in the United States Senate, where I now serve. There’s no question about that. And so it is you, the leaders of North Carolina, that are going to make a difference, and make a decision that is not only about the people of this state, but the people of our nation, because with you, when you drop that ballot in that box, or walk into the polling station, with you, you will carry the future of so many others.\nKamala Harris: (04:15)\nSo I wanted to come here to pay my respects, but also to thank you and to listen to you and to talk with you, because we are all in this together. We have 36 days to get it done. Early voting in North Carolina starts on Thursday, October 15th, so there’s not a minute to waste. And with that, let’s get started with our conversation. Thank you.\nLa’Meshia Whittington: (04:34)\nWonderful. Wonderful. Thank you again, Senator Harris. We love having you in North Carolina. So welcome to Sister to Sister Meets Talk Shop, where we are engaging African-Americans under 40 in critical conversations about the future of our communities. So for the first question up today, I’d like to welcome John [inaudible 00:04:55] for his first question, Senator Harris, for this brief Q&A.\nKamala Harris: (04:59)\nThank you.\nJohn: (05:07)\nSenator, thank you for coming to North Carolina. It’s an honor, honor for you to be here. Thank you. My question to you is this. Speaking as an Afro Latino, a Black Latino of Puerto Rican descent, Latinos have been constantly overlooked until election season. How will the Biden/Harris administration ensure that all are included, especially the Black and Brown community?\nKamala Harris: (05:29)\nThat’s a wonderful question. And it really does highlight what’s at stake in the outcome of this election in so many ways. So let’s start with one of the crises that we’re facing as a country, which is the COVID pandemic. I think of it both as a crisis that is about a public health crisis. I think of it as an economic crisis. And in many ways, it is about the crisis of long-standing disparities in our country that have been only exasperated, only highlighted, which speaks to the crisis of systemic racism in our country.\nKamala Harris: (06:08)\nSo on your point, right now we are looking at the fact that Black folks and Latinos are three times as likely to contract this virus, and equally three times as likely and twice as likely to die from it. And when we look at those disparities, we know that it’s connected with the fact that there’s a reflection between those numbers and the preexisting conditions that existed before the virus hit. This virus is a predator in many ways. It preys on people who have preexisting conditions. So when you look at the Latino community, when you look at the Black community, and you know that similar in many cases, in terms of the preexisting conditions, things like high blood pressure, things like diabetes, are real. And so part of the perspective that Joe and I share is one to acknowledge those racial disparities and then address them. And that’s about a plan that we have, for example. By the way, Donald Trump has no plan. Let’s just start there. So it’s not even like we’re contrasting plans. He actually does not have a plan. But our plan, which includes what we need to do around testing, around treatment, and I pray every night that we get a vaccine as soon as possible that is safe, and about distribution of that vaccine. It’s about addressing the fact that we need to grow what Barack Obama and Joe Biden created with the Affordable Care Act.\nKamala Harris: (07:40)\nAnd we need to expand it, so even more people have coverage, that we need to deal with the expansion in a way that we are dealing not only with the healthcare from the neck down, but let us also realize we need to also expand healthcare from the neck up. That’s called mental health care, which particularly is an issue for us in our Latino and our Black communities, especially when you look at the high rates of undiagnosed and untreated trauma, right? I mean, think about it for a moment. Just step back on that point. Poverty is trauma inducing. We need to diagnose and we need to treat it. It is trauma inducing that you experience all of the effects of poverty, including violence in communities. All of these things must be addressed, and done in a manner that is conscious of the disparities based on race, based on historical disproportionate distribution of resources.\nKamala Harris: (08:42)\nOne of the biggest issues that we face, again in terms of disparities, I can go into the history. North Carolina knows it better than most. But one of the issues is what is a challenge in terms of access to capital. So the Whites, I’m sure they have long stories about what they did to be smart around acquiring capital to build up your business, knowing that a lot of the traditional sources of access to capital were unavailable, and still are unavailable, to Black and Brown communities. So Joe Biden and I have a plan that is about $150 billion that is going to be focused on low interest loans and access to capital, with an emphasis on Black and Brown communities, knowing that our businesses have always traditionally been, again, the source of our economic lifeblood and vitality.\nKamala Harris: (09:35)\nSo those are a couple of things. I can go into the topic of criminal justice. I think we’re going to talk about that in a minute. Education, the disparities there. You look at the fact that our children are supposed to be learning from home right now, but in poor communities, in Black and Brown communities, urban communities, as well as rural communities, access to broadband is a real issue. I know it’s a real issue here in North Carolina. We’re talking about how our children should be learning from home, but first of all, that requires that you have affordable access to broadband, if you have access at all. Then, if you have more than one child, do you have access to the technology? Are you going to have that many laptops? So many of our families who have access to wifi, it’s on their cell phone. A child can’t learn remotely on a cell phone. These are real issues that will have longterm impact on our communities, if we don’t see it and address it. And that’s part of the plan we have. So I appreciate your question. Thank you.\nDevonte Wilson: (10:39)\nThank you so much, Senator Harris. And again, just your answer to that, being a middle school teacher at a Title I school, definitely all the points that you have made are definitely spot on, especially about mental health, which is so important in the African-American community. We want to turn it over now to our next question, Mr. Lavon Barnes.\nLavon Barnes: (11:00)\nGood evening, and welcome back to North Carolina.\nKamala Harris: (11:02)\nThank you. Thank you.\nLavon Barnes: (11:03)\nAnd as a proud public school…\nLavon Barnes: (11:03)\nGood evening and welcome back to North Carolina.\nKamala Harris: (11:03)\nThank you.\nLavon Barnes: (11:03)\nAnd as a proud public school teacher in Durham Public Schools, I got a shout out the school for Creative Studies before I get in trouble.\nKamala Harris: (11:08)\nYeah.\nLavon Barnes: (11:10)\nMy question to you is how will the Biden-Harris ticket propel young men to be able to have a seat at the table of leadership?\nKamala Harris: (11:22)\nAll right. So first of all, it requires that you see young men and seeing young men leaders. I find myself… It was actually after the Breonna Taylor grand jury decision that came down last week. I was reminded of one of the many sayings that my late mother had. And one of them is she would say to me, “Kamala, don’t you ever let anybody tell you who you are. You tell them who you are.” So when I say that to you, I’m not suggesting I will tell you you are a young leader and until I anoint you young leader, you are. You’re already a young leader.\nKamala Harris: (12:09)\nAnd I’m talking about the fact that I recognize that and I see that and I honor that. It means then creating not only access, but an open door with constant access so that your role of leadership can inform the decisions that I make and that we make. So that’s about being not only able to walk through the door, but having a seat at the table. On issues, again, like what we were talking about around access to capital. You are both teachers. Title I funding, Joe and I have a part of our plan for Title 1 funding is that we will triple Title I funding.\nKamala Harris: (12:52)\nAnd for everybody, everybody knows Title I funding is about funding that goes to inner city schools, to schools that have low tax base, schools that have the highest rates of need. It’s about what we need to do in terms of leadership on issues that are about education, not only K through 12, which you are both leaders as educators, but also what we need to do around creating access to employment opportunities based on providing the education that is necessary to have those kinds of jobs. The way I think about it is we got to stop talking just about higher education.\nKamala Harris: (13:33)\nI like to say instead, let’s think about it as education after high school and making sure that there are paths that are available for education after high school because the good jobs, most of them as we go forward are going to require education after high school. And for some, that’s going to be the ability to at some point then walk across the stage with a diploma and a four year degree, but for others, that’s going to be getting the education so they can get the certificate to qualify for the job that requires that skill. I’m going to need your help figuring out how we make that relevant, how we actually create it as a policy in a way it hits the streets.\nKamala Harris: (14:16)\nBecause the policy on high means nothing if it doesn’t hit the streets and that’s where access in terms of real leaders who are on the floor, on the ground will make all the difference if we’re going to be relevant. And I can go down the list of the policies that make that so. But also it’s about encouraging you, if you’re interested in running for office. It’s about being mentors. My mother, again, I’ll give you another one of her sayings. She had a lot of them. But she would say to me, “Kamala, you may be the first to do many things. Make sure you’re not the last.”\nKamala Harris: (14:55)\nAnd you can look at both Joe Biden’s career and mine to know that mentoring and legacy are very much a way of how we think about our responsibility as leaders. So thank you for that.\nLavon Barnes: (15:09)\nThank you.\nKamala Harris: (15:10)\nThank you.\nSpeaker 1: (15:10)\nThank you, [inaudible 00:15:12] for such a critical, critical question. So next as we keep this ball rolling, I’d like to introduce Mr. Marcus Bass for the next question.\nMarcus Bass: (15:24)\nSenator Harris, welcome to North Carolina. Thank you for putting yourself out there as a black woman in such a pivotal way. We see so much uncertainty in this moment, but one thing we are sure of is that leadership is needed. My question, the perception among many young black and brown voters is that a Biden-Harris ticket may not be reflective of a hard line on the true reforms necessary in our criminal justice and social economic systems. The better than 45 message alone with six weeks to go needs a sharper hard line for the base of voters protesting in this moment right now.\nMarcus Bass: (16:02)\nHow will a Biden-Harris ticket move past the lesser of two evils narrative being used to promote them to young black voters and get in tune with the issue base of the criminal justice community?\nKamala Harris: (16:15)\nI appreciate the question and the point. So first of all, the premise of your point is something I couldn’t agree with more, which is we have to earn the votes. Nobody is supposed to vote for us. We need to earn it. The other point that I think you’re raising is something that I agree profoundly with, which is let’s step back and decide how we’re going to declare a win and how we’re measuring the win, how do we define the win. Because here’s what I mean. If you define the win as just simply beating Donald Trump, then the job is over the day we get sworn in. But if you define the win as winning to actually confront the issues, then the job begins the day we’re sworn in. So I couldn’t agree more with the spirit with which you make the point. Now specifically on topic. I know as a former prosecutor, and let me give you the background on that. My parents met when they were active in the Civil Rights Movement, marching and shouting. There is not a black man I know, be he a relative or friend who has not been the subject of some form of racial profiling, unreasonable stop or excessive force.\nKamala Harris: (17:40)\nI grew up understanding how the system works and it was the very distrust that so many have today that propelled me to become a prosecutor. Because I decided, well, there are many ways to deal with the system, I’m going to choose to go in the system to see if I can’t help reform it from the inside, which is why I created some of the first in the nation initiatives. For example, one that focused on young men who were arrested for drug sales and getting them jobs and counseling. It became a national model. So I’m committed to this.\nKamala Harris: (18:13)\nThis is part of my life’s work. Joe and I are very specific about what we will do as a start, ban chokeholds and karate holes. George Floyd would be alive today if they had been banned. We will create a national policy for a standard for use of force. What’s that about? Well, excessive force right now when it happens in many jurisdictions, the question to ask is, was that use of force reasonable? Well, as we all know, you can reasonably just about anything. The more fair and just question to ask is, was that use of force necessary?\nKamala Harris: (18:51)\nJoe and I also have a plan to have a national registry around police officers who have broken the law. Why? Because in many places where there has been excessive force as an example, because the burden of prove it, see the earlier point I made, is so high, sometimes those cases just go by administrative process. So there’s an administrative process and the person gets fired. Well, there’s nothing that then follows that person when they move to a different jurisdiction and go get hired there. So we’re talking about a national registry.\nKamala Harris: (19:28)\nWe intend to get rid of the federal death penalty, to decriminalize marijuana and expunge people’s records who have been convicted and to get rid of the private prisons. Why is that important? Because let’s be clear about the business model on the private prisons, and this also relates, brother, to the private detention centers. The business model is that certain human beings are making money off the incarceration of other human beings. Right? So these are some of the specific things that we will do as a start, but there is a lot of work to be done.\nKamala Harris: (20:15)\nWhen I do national news press conferences, whatever, I say, look, I know having worked inside the system, we have to reimagine public safety and how we do public safety in our country. Because here’s the thing, you go into any upper middle-class suburban America, you will not see the kind of police presence you see in other communities, but what you will see, well-funded public schools, high rates of home ownership, access to the capital for small businesses, people who have jobs that allow them to get through the end of the month without worrying about whether they can feed their children, access to health care, including mental health care that is affordable.\nKamala Harris: (21:08)\nHealthy communities are safe communities. And so that’s part of what Joe and I’m talking about. So when the conversation we had about access to capital, I didn’t even get until I was at Shaw earlier. That was my first trip, my first visit when I came to the state this morning. But I’m a proud graduate of an HBCU, Howard University. Yes. I have any bison here? Not one. But we also are going to put $70 billion into HBCUs, 70. Because we know our HBCUs, like Shaw, and so many that North Carolina has the largest number of HBCU students of any state.\nKamala Harris: (21:52)\nWe know that that is a pathway to national and international leaders in all the professions. And part of that 70 billion is also about invest-\nKamala Harris: (22:03)\nAnd part of that 70 billion is also about investing because of the question about young leadership, right, investing in so many of our HBCUs that have research components, right? Because we want to have a presence when we’re talking about researching and figuring out how we’re going to develop things like AI. You know what AI is? Artificial intelligence. You know the other way you can think of it is machine learning. Let’s break that down for a minute because it’s so important. Machine learning. Machine learning, the educators know, that often what you learn is a function of who’s teaching you. So the machine is going to learn based on who’s teaching it. We need to make sure everyone is present in teaching the machine how it makes decisions about who does what and who can do what.\nKamala Harris: (22:57)\nInvesting in HBCUs around things like research and development, it’ll have a profound impact. So these are some of the ways that we think about it that are about the criminal justice system, but it is also about the investment that we need to make in healthy communities. I talked about home ownership. Again, North Carolina, you know the history of red lining, the history of folks being denied access even when they built up and saved the capital to being able to buy in neighborhoods where they would appreciate the value of their home. We’re talking about a $15, 000 tax credit, and this is again for young leaders, a $15,000 tax credit for new homeowners to help for downpayments and closing costs, because especially for us and for most Americans, home ownership is their greatest source of wealth and intergenerational wealth. Right?\nKamala Harris: (23:51)\nBut we need to give people a leg up on being able to actually just close on that place to develop that intergenerational wealth. So those are some of the things and I appreciate your question.\nSpeaker 2: (24:03)\nThank you.\nKamala Harris: (24:03)\nThank you.\nSpeaker 3: (24:06)\nThank you so much, Senator Harris. At this time, Lori Jones.\nLori Jones: (24:16)\nThank you so much. Thank you so much for coming out to North Carolina. Again, my question for you is what resources will be made available for small black owned businesses and for startup businesses, especially in the light of challenges faced in the recovery time from the COVID pandemic?\nKamala Harris: (24:35)\nYeah, that’s a wonderful… So that’s about the 150 billion going for low interest loans, as well as for capital for reinvestment. There’s also a big part of what we’re doing that’s about basically helping people start back up. So small businesses, to your point, I’ve seen numbers that as many as 50% or half of black owned businesses during the course of this pandemic have suffered to the point of shutting down. And the concern I have there is to shut down and never to reopen. So there’s a big part of the plan that Joe and I have, that’s about helping people restart, so that’s about rehiring and building back up.\nKamala Harris: (25:20)\nAlso with, I mean here, the white family will probably appreciate this, helping businesses have the capital to restart in a way that they can also get the grant funding to do things like build plexiglass barriers in their businesses, right? To equip their workforce with the PPEs in it, because otherwise that’s extra money out of their pocket, not to mention what we need to do for our teachers to give them that extra support, and our frontline workers, but those kinds of things. In the PPP, which is the Paycheck Protection Program, not to be confused with PPE, which is the personal protective equipment, for the PPP plan, the last numbers I saw, 90% of black minority women owned businesses did not get the benefit of it. Right?\nKamala Harris: (26:12)\nSo another component of our plan is also about reinforcing and strengthening community banks, right? So CDFIs the community development financial institutions, so they have more assets because what we know is that when our entrepreneurs decide they want to open a business and go get a loan, it’s the community bank that will know them, know the culture of the community and also give the assistance an entrepreneur needs to run a business. Because if we’re just relying on the big banks to do that, that’s not going to happen. So that’s a component of our plan as well, which is to reinforce and put more resources into the CDFIs, the community development financial institutions, because they’re the ones on the ground, so that our businesses have real access in a way that is culturally competent. So thank you.\nLori Jones: (27:11)\nThank you.\nKamala Harris: (27:11)\nYou’re welcome.\nSpeaker 4: (27:11)\nThank you so much. Again, Senator Harris, thank you so much for taking the opportunity to answer our questions this afternoon. So for our last question, I like to ask Ms. Robin Sanders to give the remaining question for this afternoon.\nRobin Sanders: (27:24)\nI’m going to take off my mask. Hi, Senator Harris. My name is Robin Sanders. I’m here with my twin sister, Ashlyn. I’m in my last year of law school right now and I’ll be clerking when I finish, and I will one day run for public office, yeah, and I’m honored to vote for you in this election.\nRobin Sanders: (27:51)\nI’m deeply troubled by the state of our nation, specifically in with respect to the law and the criminal justice system as has been stated here today. There have been ceaseless murders and executions of black Americans on video. And the most recent travesty in my mind is the Breonna Taylor murder. And my question involves accountability and equal protection, because as I watched Daniel Cameron deliver his press conference, I couldn’t help but be disturbed by the perversion of the law. He stated that the constitution affords equal protection to all citizens, but yet in the same breath, urged that Breonna Taylor would not receive justice, even though the law was clearly broken in that case. So my question is what are the priorities of the Biden Harris administration to not only demonstrate that there’s a real need for policy change, but what about the accountability piece and the equal protection piece, because black Americans deserve equal protection under the law and due process. So that’s my question.\nKamala Harris: (29:07)\nThat’s right. That’s right. That’s right. And you must run for office, just first get through law school, pass the Bar. And thank you. It’s you and your sister, both. So, I couldn’t agree with you more. Here’s here’s how I think and talk about it. There’s a phrase that’s used often in the criminal justice system, which is there needs to be accountability and consequence, accountability and consequence. And that phrase is almost entirely and totally and only used in connection with the person arrested, and not in connection with the system itself and the actors and players within the system. And that’s part of what is broken and unjust about the system.\nKamala Harris: (30:03)\nSo to your point on the accountability and consequence piece, if we are going to be true to those words, we just honored the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, equal justice under law, she who follows in the path, one of my personal heroes, Thurgood Marshall, equal justice under the law, the fight that we are continually waging, which we will one day win, especially when you become a lawyer, we have to agree that there has been a failure to have equal application of accountability and consequences in the criminal justice system.\nKamala Harris: (30:39)\nSo that’s why, as we were discussing earlier, we have in our plan those things that are going to be about accountability and consequence. On the case of Breonna Taylor, it was a gut punch for all of us to hear that. You know, I’ve talked to Tamika Palmer, her mother, starting months ago, and most recently, just a couple of days ago. You know, and what I said is what we started to talk about that Breonna Taylor’s life, we will never allow other people to measure. We know the measure of her life and the value of her life, but we still have to fight for the system to recognize.\nKamala Harris: (31:26)\nAs we often and always say black lives matter. I have said many times, in many speeches, and many situations, but America has yet to value the sanctity of black life, and has yet to treat black life as fully human, and her case couldn’t be a more recent example of that. So accountability and consequence needs to happen.\nKamala Harris: (32:07)\nWhat would we do? So it’s everything that I talked about earlier. And as a former attorney general, I was elected as only the second black woman, I think, in the history of our country to be elected and attorney general of any state. I created, when I was attorney general, I actually implemented pattern and practice investigations of law enforcement agencies. Joe and I have a commitment to doing that, which is that the United States Department of Justice, under our leadership, will have the responsibility for seriously engaging in pattern and practice investigations, putting resources into not only the pattern and practice of discrimination of excessive force, but also putting resources into the consent decrees. Right? So after a court has found that there is a problem, there-\nKamala Harris: (33:03)\n… court has found that there is a problem, there usually is a responsibility to fix it but if you’re not supervising that, that’s called the consent decree, it’s likely to not happen. The other thing we’re going to do is not only as has been done in the distant past, which is to have pattern or practice investigations of law enforcement agencies, that’s going to include prosecutor’s offices because that needs to happen also.\nKamala Harris: (33:26)\nIn addition, I do believe that in the Breonna Taylor case, there needs to be a civil rights investigation of what they did by the United States Department of Justice. We’re just going to have to keep fighting and we’re going to keep saying her name, but we say her name not just to speak her name, we say her name to motivate action. And that’s what’s most important.\nSpeaker 5: (33:54)\nThank you.\nDevonte Wilson: (33:54)\nWonderful. Thank you so very much, Senator Harris for coming to the great Tower Hill state of North Carolina, and a lot of the issues that we touched today, my grandmother has a saying, “Real change is hard change, but it’s necessary change.”\nKamala Harris: (34:09)\nThat’s right.\nDevonte Wilson: (34:09)\nAnd that is the epitome of the campaign that we see. And so we’re just so thankful and we want to turn it over to you for closing remarks.\nKamala Harris: (34:15)\nThank you. Well, I’m just honored to be with so many leaders. I appreciate the candid and the direct conversation we’ve had. I hope to have many more. There’s so much to get done. There’s so much to get done and we can get it done. I do believe that, but everything that we’ve talked about and so much more is at stake in this election. I mean, not to mention the man pays $750. Come on now, on top of all of that, adding insult to injury, but there’s so much at stake. And when I think about all of our leaders of every generation, I’m here to ask you for your help. Joe, and I need your help.\nKamala Harris: (35:14)\nI guess my final point would be about voting. The brother here has his Vote 2020 mask on. North Carolina has a specific and a particular history with this issue that has been going on since the ancestor were fighting. Shaw, right? Southern Christian Leadership, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, which John Lewis led and shed his blood on that Edmund Pettus Bridge. In fact, that was the last big public event I attended before the pandemic was to walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with John Lewis.\nKamala Harris: (35:58)\nSo there is the historical piece of this. Of all of those who marched and died and shed their blood, there is the piece of it that is about what happened in 2013 when the United States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act with Shelby County v. Holder. And as you in North Carolina know, legislators then and in North Carolina’s case with surgical precision pass laws to prevent and to make it difficult for black people to vote. So we’ve got the reason to vote, which is to honor the ancestors like John Lewis, we’ve got the reason to vote, which is knowing that there are people who are putting so many powerful obstacles in our way when we have so much at stake. And then here’s the other piece that I would just add to close out our thoughts. You got to sit back at some point and ask, “Why are so many powerful people trying to stand in our way to vote?” Like why? Why are they trying to make it difficult? Why are they trying to confuse people? Why are they trying to suppress the black vote? And here’s the answer I believe. Because they know when we vote things change. They know when we vote, things get better and they’re scared of that.\nKamala Harris: (37:41)\nAnd so I say, let us not ever let anybody take our power. Not now, not ever, let us not let anyone stand in the way of the power of our vote, no matter how difficult they are trying. And they are trying. So let’s make sure everybody in North Carolina votes early, early voting starts Thursday, October 15th. Let’s let our voices be heard. Yes, in the name of the ancestors. Yes, because there is so much at stake and yes, because we’re not letting anybody messing with our power. Thank you, all. Thank you.\nLa’Meshia Whittington: (38:39)\nThank you, everyone for joining us this evening. We’re going to take individual photos. So at this time you will be seated. We’ll call you all one by one. We’ll make sure that we stay socially distanced from the Senator as we begin the photo line.\nKamala Harris: (38:54)\nAnd she will be socially distanced from you.\nLa’Meshia Whittington: (38:56)\nRight. She will be socially distanced from you as well. And so going to start on moderators since they’re right here in front. Please keep your mask on. Also, no personal phones. We will send you your photos.\nSpeaker 6: (40:12)\n[inaudible 00: 06:21]. (silence)",

         "Lynn Kerry: (06:00)\nJill. My family understands the economic consequences of health insurance. In 2004, I was diagnosed with a rare lung disease. I saw my doctor because I was short of breath. I thought I would leave his office with a prescription for an inhaler. Instead, I left with a prescription for oxygen, 24/7, and a diagnosis that changed my life. I was on oxygen every day, all day. I was on very expensive medications. I needed to be monitored by my pulmonologist every three months. And I needed expensive procedures like heart catheterizations. I had to stop working. And when you stop working, we all know what happens, right? What do you lose? Your health insurance.\nLynn Kerry: (06:58)\nI lost my health insurance. I was able to go on my husband’s plan and then he lost his job. So we lost our insurance again. I know what it feels like to be sitting across the table when someone tells you that you do not qualify for insurance because you have a pre-existing condition. We cannot go back. Fortunately, he did find a job shortly after and I was able to get on his plan. They could not deny me because of the ACA. Actually Dr. Biden, Jill, I first met you eight years ago during the Obama Biden re-election campaign. I was on oxygen and I have a picture. And for some reason you look that same. But I don’t look that same. But I remember your kindness and concern as we talked.\nLynn Kerry: (08:01)\nWell, as you can see, I don’t need oxygen to talk with you today. On May 13th, 2015, I was fortunate enough to have a double lung transplant. Thanks to a young woman, a 37 year old young woman who chose to be an organ donor. So transplants and ICU stays and rehab are expensive. We did not go bankrupt. We did not have to worry about losing everything we had worked so hard for, because of the ACA.\nLynn Kerry: (08:48)\nAnd now, COVID threatens all Americans, and particularly those who have chronic health problems or are immunosuppressed like I am. So you see, I understand that this is a critical time. I understand that much is at stake in this election. For me, for my family, healthcare is at the top of my list. Joe Biden has laid a detailed set of plans. I was just on the website yesterday looking at the health plan once again. And no matter who you are, Joe would make COVID testing, treatment, and vaccines available to all of us free. Yes, that’s huge. Americans will have a new choice offering a new public option like Medicare, the fastest path to universal coverage. We all have the opportunity to elect a candidate in Joe Biden with the experience to help us recover and the empathy to help our country heal.\nLynn Kerry: (10:04)\nSo with that, I would like to introduce someone who I think speaks so well and gives me hope every day. Our second lady, former second lady, soon to be our first lady, Dr. Jill Biden.\nJill Biden: (10:22)\nThank you. Okay. Thank you, Lynn. And it’s wonderful to see you again. My gosh. You know, as a nursing educator and a transplant survivor, you know our healthcare system better than anyone. Wow, you have quite a story, and you’ve seen how innovation can save lives and the quality of care doesn’t mean much if you can’t afford it. Right? So once again, I’m so grateful for your sharing your incredible story, and I thank you for your tireless efforts for making sure that all Americans get the healthcare that they need.\nJill Biden: (11:12)\nAmy and Maggie, thank you so much for hosting us today in your beautiful house, and your beautiful land, with your beautiful animals. So, I’m so glad to be here in Waukesha. I said that right, right? Okay. Especially to be here in person after I’ve done so many virtual events in your state, but I’d like to start with a personal story of my own.\nJill Biden: (11:43)\nSo as many of you know, for the last 10 years, I’ve taught writing at Northern Virginia Community College, but I’ve been teacher for forever for 36 years. And a few years ago, I had to tell my students that I would miss the next class for personal reasons. And so my students have a lot of shining qualities, but boundaries are not one of them. So they immediately began shouting to me, “Dr. B, Dr. B, where are you going?” Well, my sister Jan was having a STEM cell transplant, the first of her cancer treatments, and she would be isolated in a hospital room for over six weeks. And I tried to explain that to my class with as much composure as I could muster, but as I tried to tell them, the words caught in my throat. And so I turned around and I was in my classroom and I faced the whiteboard, hoping to gain my composure, and as I turned back around, my entire class was lined up and they gave me a hug one by one.\nJill Biden: (13:08)\nAnd that act of kindness, that act of community, gave me the strength to keep going. And it saved me in a time when I didn’t even realize how much I was struggling. And in a way, that act of community saved my sister Jan, too. You know, she has built her career as a waitress. And when she got sick, believe me, she didn’t have the money and she didn’t have the insurance to cover her treatments. It was only because of the Affordable Care Act that she was able to find a plan that she could afford. And it was that law that made it possible for her to get covered, even though she had a pre-existing condition.\nJill Biden: (13:59)\nSo it’s easy to take for granted just how much changed when we passed the ACA. So, 20 million people got covered, it’s amazing to think of that, including more than 200,000 Wisconsinites. Wisconsinites. I don’t think I ever said that word before. So pre-existing conditions got covered. You know, it’s not an exaggeration to say that this law saved my sister’s life. And we all know that the ability to take care of our health is the foundation of a good life. I mean, we all agree with that. But these last few months have shown us that it’s more than that, too. Our health is the foundation of our communities and our economy. And gosh, this pandemic has done so much damage. Some of it can be measured. The over, over 200,000 American lives lost. Millions who have contracted this disease and because of it now have a pre-existing condition. The more than 10 million workers who are jobless.\nJill Biden: (15:27)\nBut in other ways, the damage can’t be measured. The lost time with our loved ones, the mental toll of isolation and anxiety, the shattered hearts of every family that is grieving a loved one, and it didn’t have to be this way. I mean, that’s what’s so unbelievable. It didn’t have to be this way. And at almost every turn, this administration has not only failed to prevent and mitigate the destruction around us, they’ve made it worse.\nJill Biden: (16:07)\nAs the pandemic rages, President Trump is attacking the healthcare coverage that millions of Americans rely on, and trying to eliminate the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. He’s hoping to get rid of the law that protects them. I mean, for all of us, I mean, it’s unbelievable. Still, amid the chaos and the grief, we also have so many stories of courage and resistance, and resilience. Healthcare workers going above and beyond to care for their patients. Educators driving to neighborhoods to create hotspots for kids who don’t have WiFi. People donating food at food banks in order for others to keep safe. It’s amazing the food insecurity that we’ve seen in this country. And across this country, people of all walks of life are putting their shoulders back and fighting for each other. We haven’t given up. We just need leadership worthy of our nation, worthy of all of you.\nJill Biden: (17:27)\nAnd Joe is the only candidate in this race with the plan to recover from this pandemic. He’s going to provide clear evidence-based, yes, he believes in science, national guidance for businesses, schools and individuals, created by public health experts. And he’s going to make sure that our schools and our childcare centers have the resources that they need to be safe so that our kids can go back to school and we all can go back to work. And he’s going to ensure that all Americans have access, like was said, to free testing, free treatments, and when that vaccine comes out, so that we can protect our families and our communities.\nJill Biden: (18:21)\nBut it’s not just about returning to a system that left so many behind. It’s about building our nation back better than before. And that’s why Joe is going to make sure that our steps for economic recovery are just equitable and benefit all Americans, creating millions of good paying jobs. And he’s going to invest in the small businesses that are the backbone of our country. And he will not only defend the Affordable Care Act, he will build on it as well. Because it was always meant to be like a starting point, not a finish line. So he’s going to create a public health insurance option, like Medicare, so that everyone can have high quality affordable healthcare plan. And he’s going to lower premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. And the big one, I think for everybody, he’s going to make prescription drugs affordable. And I hear that comes across this country.\nJill Biden: (19:35)\nJoe has spent his entire career bringing people together and getting this seemingly impossible done. And I can’t think of anyone better to lead us through this pandemic than my husband, Joe. With the chaos of this moment, the uncertainty, it can be easy to watch what’s going on and feel so discouraged. I mean, I feel, I hear from a lot of people how much anxiety and depression they feel. But right now we don’t have to just watch what happens, we have to decide what happens. And when we elect Joe and Kamala, they will help bring us back together and heal our fractured communities. And they have the fortitude to help us rebuild better than ever. And with their steady leadership, steady, not chaos like we have now, we can change the course of our future.\nJill Biden: (20:39)\nSo for just a moment, I want to take you to that future. So imagine that it’s November 4th, the day after the election. I know we’re all like counting down, right? You wake up and it’s a beautiful morning, maybe a little bit more sunshine than today. And maybe you stayed up a little too late watching the returns. I’m sure we’re going to be up until all night. So you go and you pour yourself a cup of coffee. And at first you start to worry about your day, which I’m sure you all do now like thinking, “Oh my gosh, what time are my meetings? What time do I have to get onto that computer?” You know, you’re thinking about your Zoom schedule. And then it hits you like, “Oh my God, Joe Biden won the election.”\nJill Biden: (21:30)\nPretty soon there’s going to be a nationwide strategy to end this pandemic. And when you go out to get your mail, you think about your neighbor who lost her job. And then you realize, whoa, the next president is the same man who led the recovery in 2008 that created millions of jobs. You go to check the news and you notice there’s no pit in your stomach. Your shoulders don’t tense up. You’re not dreading what’s going on in the world. Instead, you sit a little taller knowing that our next commander in chief will bring out the best in us, a president and a vice president elect that your kids, your granddaughter, can look up to, leadership that makes you proud, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And for the first time in so long, you take a deep breath and you feel hope. That’s the November 4th that I want, and I know it’s the November 4th you all want or you wouldn’t be sitting here today.\nJill Biden: (22:49)\nIn this moment, we have the power to decide what comes next. So I know you’re here because you’re already engaged or you wouldn’t be sitting in this freezing cold. And I know you’re busy and you’re probably stretched too thin, but I’m asking you to just do a little bit more for the next 36 days, because this election is just too important to sit out on the sidelines. All of us have to do every single thing we can until the election. This is it. There are no do-overs. This is our last shot to wake up November 4th and feel that hope.\nJill Biden: (23:34)\nSo join us. Go to Iwillvote.com to make sure you’re registered, so I don’t know if you’ve all done that, so to make sure you’re registered. Help your friends and family do that, too. Make sure they’re registered. Then if you want to get involved with our campaign. This is so funny. You text cheese, three, zero, three, three, zero. It’s very fitting. So we have just 36 more days, 36 more days to make sure that our voices are heard, to make calls and talk to our neighbors, to fight for this country like we’ve never fought before. Let’s wake up November 4th knowing that we did everything we can to feel that hope again. This is our moment. This is our election. This is our nation and we will get to choose our future together.\nJill Biden: (24:36)\nSo thank you all for being here. Thank you for, you know, in this chilly weather. Thank you for your commitment and your support. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Oh, thanks. Okay. Thanks.",

         "Speaker 1: (01:00)\n(silence). Please welcome Sen. Kamala Harris.\nKamala Harris: (01:18)\nGood afternoon. On Friday morning I attended the memorial service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the United States Capitol. She was the first woman in our history to lie in state. I sat a few feet away from her flag-draped casket to pay my respects and it was somber and it was personal. And it was an extraordinary moment for me as I’m sure it was for you and millions of Americans and people around the world who felt a connection with the great RBG. It was sad because we lost a giant, not only of the court but of American life. It was a celebration.\nKamala Harris: (02:11)\nFew people in our history have done more to change the lives of the American people than Ruth Bader Ginsburg did as a lawyer, an advocate, and a Supreme Court Justice. And it was an inspiration and a call to each of us, for each of us to be better, to stay in the fight and stay committed to what motivated Justice Ginsburg the most, that phrase etched in the marble of the United States Supreme Court, “Equal Justice Under Law.”\nKamala Harris: (02:48)\nJustice Ginsburg came to her view of the law not from a textbook but from life, her own life. She often told the story of how she had personally felt the sting of discrimination as a woman, as the mother of a young child trying to find work. And so she committed her life step-by-step, case-by-case, law-by-law, to tear down the obstacles in the way of so many and especially women. Now, we are about to undertake the task of finding her replacement on the United States Supreme Court. Of course, it’s hard to say those words. In truth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot be replaced, she was an original, a one of a kind. She combined a steel spine with an ability to extend an open hand, never a closed fist.\nKamala Harris: (04:01)\nShe demonstrated you could both hold firm to your principles and still hear those with whom you disagree. That is a lesson that should be ringing in our ears, but it looks like this president and his party are not interested in hearing any of the lessons from Justice Ginsburg. Already the president and his party have chosen to ignore Justice Ginsburg’s final wish, to hold off the nomination to replace her until after the next president is chosen, a wish by the way shared by the American people. And look, it’s not complicated, the voters would simply like to have an opportunity to vote for their president before the Senate votes on a nominee. And that’s not too much to ask but President Trump and his party are not interested in hearing the will of the people, in fact as my sense is, that they’re afraid of what they’re going to be told.\nKamala Harris: (05:15)\nWe are not even debating, okay, this is really important. We’re not even debating whether the Senate should hold hearings on a nominee and in election year, we’re not in the middle of an election year, we’re in the middle of an election, an ongoing election. Almost a million Americans have already voted and more will vote this week and next week, and in just a few weeks all Americans will have voted. But President Trump and his party don’t care, they just want to jam this nomination through as fast as they can. It’s called raw power.\nKamala Harris: (06:07)\nBut President Trump and his party are about to learn something. They may think that it is they who have the power in this country, but they don’t. The American people are the ones who have the power, you have the power and you can make it very clear very soon how you feel about being cut out of this Supreme Court nomination process. Even worse, though then the president and his party ignoring Justice Ginsburg’s final wish, is their determination to appoint a Justice who will undo her life’s work.\nKamala Harris: (06:55)\nLet’s be clear, the Supreme Court will impact our lives in three critical ways. First, President Trump and his party have made it clear they will pick a Justice who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And in fact just days after the election, the court will hear a case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. It’s a decision that could take away healthcare for 20 million Americans. It is a decision that could take away protections for preexisting conditions from more than 100 million people in our country. It’s a decision that could take away Medicare benefits for seniors, it’s a decision that could toss out the rule that says children can be covered on their parents’ healthcare up to the age of 26. All of that will hurt the millions of Americans who have come to rely on the Affordable Care Act.\nKamala Harris: (07:59)\nAnd what is especially offensive about what President Trump and his party are up to is this, getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward to a time where you could charge a woman more for her healthcare than you can charge a man just because she’s a woman. Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward to a time when pregnancy could be considered a preexisting condition. Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take away birth control and contraceptive coverage for women. And get this, this relentless obsession with over turning the Affordable Care Act is driven entirely by a blind rage toward President Obama, and it’s happening at a moment when our country is suffering through the ravages of a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives in our country. Complications from COVID-19 like lung scarring and heart damage could well become the next preexisting condition.\nKamala Harris: (09:11)\nIn short there are a few things they could do that would be more offensive to the legacy and the life of Justice Ginsburg than to return us to the full-scale policies of discrimination in healthcare toward the women of our country. But that’s what overturning the Affordable Care Act will do, and overturning the Affordable Care Act is a way a nominee gets the support of this president and his party.\nKamala Harris: (09:42)\nAs Attorney General of California I defended your right to healthcare. As Senator I voted to protect your right to healthcare, but now President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett, and we know where Judge Barrett stands on the Affordable Care Act. Judge Barrett is on record opposing the decision that upheld the Affordable Care Act. As recently as 2017, she specifically attacked the Chief Justice’s opinion in an article where she said, “Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.”\nKamala Harris: (10:27)\nIf nothing else the voters should be very clear about one thing, President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett will overturn the Affordable Care Act and they won’t stop there. They have made clear that they want to overturn Roe v. Wade and restrict reproductive rights and freedoms. Judge Barrett has a long record of opposing abortion and reproductive rights. There is no other issue that’s so disrespects and dishonors the work of Justice Ginsburg’s life than undoing the seminal decision in the court’s history that made it clear a woman has a right to make decisions about her own body.\nKamala Harris: (11:21)\nBut that’s where President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett are, so let’s make it clear where we are. Let’s vote for healthcare, vote for the Affordable Care Act. Vote as if your life, your choice depends on it because it does. Make it clear to President Trump and to every Republican Senator that if they’re determined to get rid of your healthcare you’ll be just as determined to vote them out of office. And second, vote as if your right to vote depends on it, because it does.\nKamala Harris: (12:06)\nIn 2013, the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby v. Holder gutted the hearts of the Voting Rights Act. Soon after numerous states including Texas, and North Carolina, and Alabama, and Mississippi enacted discriminatory laws designed to suppress the people’s right to vote and targeted people of color and students. Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like, “Throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm.” Right here in North Carolina, a voter suppression law was described by a federal court as having targeted African-Americans with almost surgical precision to deny us the right to vote, surgical precision.\nKamala Harris: (13:00)\nAfter the people of Florida voted to grant formerly incarcerated citizens the right to vote Republican officials recently enacted a modern-day poll tax to make it harder for those citizens to exercise that very right in this upcoming election. And this modern-day poll tax was upheld by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in large part because of judges appointed by Donald Trump. But you see here’s the thing, he knows he can’t win if the people vote. Donald Trump is weak so he is throwing up every roadblock he can to try and suppress the vote and we the people can not let him get away with it.\nKamala Harris: (13:53)\nThird, what’s at stake? Our ability to make a living, take care of our families and dismantle systemic racism, that’s at stake too. For example, court decisions can determine your ability to earn a living wage, to receive equal pay for equal work, or collectively bargain for your rights at work. With an extra vote on the court, Donald Trump and his party will continue their attack on laws that keep our air clean and our food and water safe and attack any legislation that addresses climate change. They will also continue to divide us and ignore the systemic racism that still plagues our society.\nKamala Harris: (14:43)\nTheir decisions could fail to hold the actors in our criminal justice system accountable. Victims of abuse of power by law enforcement could be less likely to succeed on their civil rights claims. The due process rights of criminal defendants could be less likely to be vigorously enforced. These are the decisions that would upend Justice Ginsburg’s life’s work to uphold basic liberties of all Americans regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or economic station.\nKamala Harris: (15:25)\nYes, she was part of our culture. Yes, we wear those notorious BIG T-shirts with a lot of pride, but since she passed there are parents reminding their children that she helped their lives in concrete yet immeasurable ways. Because of her they could get a job of their dreams, fight for equal pay for their work, marry the person they love, serve the country they love and enjoy the full rights and privileges of citizenship that they deserve free of discrimination. And that legacy, her belief in all of us is at stake.\nKamala Harris: (16:17)\nThe outcome of this election more than any other in our lifetime affects every part of your life and every branch of government all at once with consequences that will last generations, and all with the nation in crisis and at a crossroads, the pandemic, the recession, a reckoning on racial injustice, a changing climate, a crisis with the nomination to the Supreme Court. I know that it feels sometimes like this is just too much, too much for us to take, too much for our country to take, and I think that’s what they want you to believe. They want you to feel tired, they want you to feel like your fight doesn’t matter but we will not give up and we will not give in.\nKamala Harris: (17:21)\nWe will not let the infection that President Trump has injected into the presidency and into Congress that has paralyzed our politics and pitted Americans against each other spread to the United States Supreme Court. This election is about more than the presidency or the Senate or the Supreme Court, this election is about our democracy. And as Joe Biden has said from the moment he entered this race it’s about the soul of our nation, who we are, what we stand for, and maybe most importantly, who we want to be.\nKamala Harris: (18:12)\nAnd that’s what I felt when I said goodbye to Justice Ginsburg. She understood the soul of our nation and what is expected of each of us. And that belief is especially resonant at a place like Shaw University, one of our nation’s first black landmarks of higher learning established just six months after the Civil War. People born into bondage and brutality stood on this very ground as graduates and as scholars. I stand here at Estey Hall, the country’s first university hall built to educate black women in America. A century later and a few months after the Greensboro sit-ins, Ella Baker and fellow students at Shaw established the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee that our dear John Lewis would one day lead.\nKamala Harris: (19:13)\nI stand here on their shoulders and with all of you as the nominee for vice president of the United States. I stand with Joe Biden who will be your next president, I stand with Cal Cunningham who will be the next Senator from the great State of North Carolina, and I stand with them and the American people to fight for a Supreme Court Justice who like Justice Ginsburg truly believes in equal justice under law. May God bless Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, may God bless you all and may God bless the United States of America. (silence).",

         "David Perdue: (00:01)\nHow great is it to be back in Macon, Georgia with Donald Trump coming to Macon again? I want to thank Governor Kemp because he laid it out just now, but let me remind you of something that happened in 2002. Sunny just mentioned it. Because of you, we turned this thing around, and for the last 18 years, we have built a state that’s now the number one state in the country in which to do business.\nDavid Perdue: (00:25)\nThat did not happen by accident. Brian Kemp is the third governor in a row that understands how to do that. And thanks to you, that’s going to continue. Today, we have an opportunity. Every generation has an opportunity like this. They have their moment of crisis. With Donald Trump, it’s all about promises made and promises delivered. After eight years of Joe Biden, you hear Joe lately? Joe said the other day, he said, “Oh yeah, you guys were enjoying that economic Renaissance because of what we did with Barack Obama.”\nDavid Perdue: (01:06)\nNow guys, I’m just a dumb business guy for right over that hill, right there, and I can tell you, that is a lie right out of the pit of hell. Donald Trump, after eight years of Barack Obama and Joe Biden giving us the lowest economic output in U.S. history, and we felt that right here in Georgia, Donald Trump gave us the best economic turnaround in U.S. history, y’all.\nDavid Perdue: (01:36)\nSeven and a half million new jobs, highest middle class income ever measured, the lowest unemployment for African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanics ever measured. After 800,000 people, under Barack Obama, fell into poverty, under Donald Trump, six and a half million people have lifted themselves out of poverty, y’all. Now that’s America.\nDavid Perdue: (01:57)\nBut it took Donald Trump, not the bureaucrats in Washington, not some career politician, but it took Donald Trump to build that wall. It took Donald Trump to move that embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It took Donald Trump to name 200 new federal judges, including Neil Gorsich and Brett Kavanaugh. And next week, we will know that we will confirm Amy Cony Barrett. Mark my words.\nDavid Perdue: (02:43)\nIt’s one thing to stand up here and cheer. It’s one thing to stand up and remind everybody. This guy is providential. He didn’t happen by accident. How in the world, in our political system, could Donald J. Trump come on the scene in 2016 and do what he did? Tell me. But God’s watching. He’s watching what we’re going to do right now. What’s at stake is this, and I mean this: It’s our time to stand up to the socialist movement that for the last 100 years has been trying to take over our beloved America.\nDavid Perdue: (03:27)\nIt didn’t just start in the ’30s. It started long ago, but they believe they have it in their grasp now. They believe these CNN polls and CNBC polls. Oh, let me tell you, they don’t know the big red poll right here. But this is what I believe is a stake. Mark my words. They believe this. That if they get the majority of the Senate and they win the White House, Joe Biden has already said, your taxes are going up, guys.\nDavid Perdue: (03:56)\nHe’s already said. You know those regulations that those mean old demonic Republicans, all those regulations you pulled back, we’re going to give it back to you. You know that healthcare that we screwed up? We’re going to do it again. But most importantly, guys, they want to stack the Supreme Court. Did you see that? They want to stack the Supreme Court. Now what President Trump has done is brought balance back to the Supreme Court. These aren’t activists. These are constitutionalists. They’re up there to protect you and me.\nDavid Perdue: (04:32)\nBut the most insidious thing that Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden are trying to perpetrate, and Bernie and Elizabeth and Kamala, or what? Kamala or Kamala or Kamala mala mala, I don’t know. Whatever. They’re trying to perpetrate a lie, and that is that socialism, this radical socialism that they’re trying to sell us, is better than our beloved democracy. We’re not going to let that stand.\nDavid Perdue: (04:57)\nAnd here’s how they’re going to do it. You stack the courts, you change the voting rules in the Senate, and pretty soon you start adding democratic states. You get rid of the electoral college or change it like they can do, and pretty soon you’re talking about a one-party state, guys. That failed in Russia in 1917, it failed in Cuba in 1959, Venezuela today. You can’t find a country in the world where that has ever worked.\nDavid Perdue: (05:19)\nNow why in the world would we ever go down that road, particularly after the last 75 years in this country where God has blessed us so greatly that we can come out today and say what we want independent of what that media says? I need you to do one thing. Stand with me, stand with our President, and let’s make damn sure that the road to socialism never runs through the state of Georgia. God bless you guys.",
