Thank you. I love New Jersey and I’m thrilled to be back right here in the Garden State. Thank you. The Garden State.\\nDonald Trump: (01:34)\\nTogether we’re achieving historic victories for New Jersey families. You see it every single day. The New Jersey unemployment rate has reached the lowest of all time. More people are working today in the state of New Jersey than ever before. I have to tell you more people, almost 160 million, are working right now in the United States. That’s the highest level of employment in the history of our country. A lot of countries aren’t doing so well, just so you understand.\\nDonald Trump: (02:23)\\nTomorrow we will replace the NAFTA nightmare, one of the worst trade deals ever in history, with the incredible brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA. A massive win for New Jersey workers, New Jersey farmers, New Jersey union people, New Jersey manufacturers and everybody.\\nDonald Trump: (02:55)\\nWeeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with China that will boost New Jersey exports and defend New Jersey jobs. $250 billion coming in. Oh that’s going to be so nice. We’re restoring America’s industrial might like never before. They’re all coming back. They want to be where the action is.\\nDonald Trump: (03:26)\\nAfter years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the United States military.\\nCrowd: (03:35)\\n[crosstalk 00:03:35] USA.\\nDonald Trump: (03:57)\\nThanks to the incredible courage of our warriors, the greatest warriors in the world, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its savage founder, and leader, al-Baghdadi is dead.\\nCrowd: (04:12)\\n[crosstalk 00:04:12] USA.\\nDonald Trump: (04:35)\\nWeeks ago, at my direction, the US military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world’s number one terrorist Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans, and actively planning new attacks, but we stopped him cold. Yet Washington Democrats, like crazy Bernie Sanders and nervous Nancy Pelosi, they opposed our action to save American lives. They oppose it. They oppose it. You know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly? The legs, the arms, wiped out. No legs, no arms. Soleimani loved that. That was his weapon of choice. We didn’t like him. He’s not around anymore.\\nDonald Trump: (05:49)\\nWell we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the Congressional Democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes, crazy witch hunts, and deranged partisan crusades. It’s all they know how to do. The do nothing Democrats. They have spent the last three years, and probably even before I came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady, trying to overthrow the last election. We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election. We are going to have a victory that’s even greater than 2016. This November we are going to win back the House, we are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep The White House.\\nCrowd: (06:51)\\n[crosstalk 00:06:51] Four more years.\\nDonald Trump: (07:13)\\nThe American people are disgusted by the Washington Democrat … You see it. You see it. Which is worse, the impeachment hoax or the witch hunts from Russia? But we’re going to be signing up millions and millions of registered Independents, Democrat voters. Today I had the best polls that I’ve ever had since being elected. The best we’ve ever had. Remember I used to go over polls? But I only used to talk about them when I was doing well otherwise I wouldn’t. We had our best polls.\\nDonald Trump: (07:59)\\nAmericans of all political beliefs are sick and tired of the radical rage filled left Socialists. I never saw anything … What’s going on in this country … What’s going on in this country, really the Democrat party is the Socialist party and maybe worse. Voters are making a mass exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the Republican party with wide open arms. The Republican party is doing great.\\nDonald Trump: (08:38)\\nWe are privileged to be joined tonight by a courageous leader who left the Democrat party because he has had enough of their extremism, enough of their Socialism, and enough of their vile hoaxes and scams. He’s had enough. I tell you he really is, he’s a brave guy. He just said, ” I’m not doing it. I’m not doing it. It’s a hoax, it’s a scam, I’m not doing it.” We called him, “You’re our kind of guy. Let’s go.” It didn’t take much because he believes like we do. We are truly honored to be here with the newest Republican member of the House of Representatives, your great congressman, Jeff Van Drew. I have to tell you a few weeks ago Jeff was one of the few brave and principled Democrat lawmakers, in all fairness we’ve been after him for a longtime, who stood up to the House Democrats and the outrageous abusive power that you see going on right now. They can’t win an election so they’re trying to steal an election. It’s not happening folks. It’s not happening. Jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party, and to stand tall in defense of our constitution, our freedom, and democracy itself. I just want to … I have to tell you, I’ve gotten to know him really well over the last couple of weeks. He’s a great guy, he’s a brave guy, he shares our values. He supports lower taxes, not bad. They want to raise your taxes.\\nDonald Trump: (10:24)\\nHow did that work Jeff? How did you get elected with that one?\\nDonald Trump: (10:27)\\nLess regulation, a strong national defense. He loves our military, loves our vets, and police. He is a tireless champion for the state of New Jersey. He loves your second amendment, which is under siege by the Democrats.\\nDonald Trump: (10:47)\\nJeff, it’s an honor to be with you. Please, please. Thank you. Thank you man.\\nJeff Van Drew: (10:52)\\n[inaudible 00:10:52] How about having the president right here in South Jersey? What a great day!\\nJeff Van Drew: (11:10)\\nNow I heard that the folks in this room can make more noise and more applause than anywhere in the world, so we’re going to do one more time for this man right here.\\nJeff Van Drew: (11:40)\\nFor you. Now when I was in The White House with the president he asked how he could help me. I asked if he could come down to South Jersey and have a rally. Without even hesitating our president said yes and he is here. A man who kept his word to ensure that the eyes of the world are on South Jersey and all of us.\\nJeff Van Drew: (12:18)\\nThe USA is a great nation. The greatest nation that civilization has ever known. Do we want to keep it that way?\\nCrowd: (12:29)\\n[crosstalk 00:12:29] Yeah.\\nJeff Van Drew: (12:32)\\nIt’s a nation and a people of great exceptionalism. Do we want to keep it that way?\\nCrowd: (12:40)\\n[crosstalk 00:12:40] Yeah.\\nJeff Van Drew: (12:42)\\nOur president has made it clear, by restoring our military, protecting our economy, and by not allowing any other nation to ever take advantage of us again. Do we want to keep it that way?\\nCrowd: (12:57)\\n[crosstalk 00:12:57] Yeah.\\nJeff Van Drew: (13:02)\\nThis year … This year, this very year, is a flashpoint election. Are we going to allow ourselves just to be like any other nation in the world or are we going to keep America great?\\nCrowd: (13:19)\\n[crosstalk 00:13:19] Yeah.\\nJeff Van Drew: (13:21)\\nI say to all of you may God bless South Jersey, may God bless our president, and may God bless the United States of America.\\nCrowd: (13:30)\\n[crosstalk 00:13:30] USA.\\nDonald Trump: (13:48)\\nWe have tens of thousands of people outside. If anybody would like to give them your place please let us know, but we have thousands and thousands. Tens of thousands. Jeff gave me a number, he said, “175,000 people signed up.” Is that a fact?\\nJeff Van Drew: (14:04)\\nThat’s a fact.\\nDonald Trump: (14:06)\\n175? I think he’s on his way. I think he’s on his way. Thank you Jeff, great job. Thank you Jeff. Thank you Jeff.\\nDonald Trump: (14:21)\\nIt’s been a little bit of a story. You see the fakers back there? Fake news. Fake. You know if another candidate has 1,000 people they say he spoke to a massive crowd. If they have 10,000, like Pocahontas went into Central Park in New York. This young men could have 10,000 people, you know that, in Central Park. She had 10,000 people like in Central Park. I said, “What’s the big deal?” They made it, “Oh the crowds are so large.” Jeff just told you he had 175,000 people sign up. Seriously you have to see outside. They know because they have to follow, they’re trailers. I call them trailers. But they’re fake. They’re fake. They’re not honest.\\nDonald Trump: (15:23)\\nLet me just tell you, so here’s the story, so we have these massive crowds that fill up stadiums every single time. We have tens of thousands of people outside. They never mention it. They never mention it, so maybe they will tonight. But that’s an all-time record. This is not a brand new place and unfortunately it holds 10,000 people or less. We set the all-time record. You know why? Because for games … See the floor packed with people? For games you’re playing ice hockey or basketball, so we broke the all-time record in this house. It’s a wonderful house in a wonderful community.\\nDonald Trump: (16:15)\\nAlso in Wildwood, like we’re in the middle of winter. There is nobody in the middle of winter and it’s a great place in the summer. Those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane practically. But on June 2nd everybody has to do us all a favor. Number one you have to get out and vote Republican. Get rid of these clowns. You have to get out and vote for really a brave man. What he did was incredible. Jeff Van Drew, what he did was incredible. Get out and vote. He’s going to have a big victory. He’s going to have a big victory.\\nDonald Trump: (16:57)\\nWe’re grateful to have with us this evening some wonderful friends of mine, people that I’ve known forever, your former governor who did a terrific job, Chris Christie. Chris. Great Chris, great job. Your wonderful Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt, what a job he’s doing. Thank you Doug. Thank you Doug.\\nDonald Trump: (17:27)\\nMy campaign’s two great New Jersey co-chairs and I think we’ll play for the state … You know they all say Republicans can’t win. Tell me why? They said, “Should you move this to the Meadowlands?” I said, “No, I want to be in South Jersey. We want to be with our friends.” But we could have filled up the Meadowlands arena two or three times. Maybe we’ll do it during the summer. Should we do it during the summer?\\nCrowd: (17:54)\\n[crosstalk 00:17:54] Yeah.\\nDonald Trump: (17:57)\\nMaybe. But two brave guys, two great politicians. People that love our state. State senators Mike Testa and Joe Pennacchio. Joe Pennacchio. Thank you Joe. Thank you. Thank you. Two incredible New Jersey natives, you’ve never heard of Kellyanne Conway have you?\\nCrowd: (18:21)\\n[crosstalk 00:18:21] Yeah.\\nDonald Trump: (18:27)\\nAnd Bill Stepien. [inaudible 00:18:29] say something.\\nKellyanne C.: (18:45)\\nAnd I love you back. Mr. President I think South Jersey is Trump country. Mr. President thank you for all you’ve done to add respect and resources to our military, to our great veterans. Having the best economy in the world. Two new trade deals. Two Supreme Court justices. Two dead terrorists. That’s two terms.\\nKellyanne C.: (19:28)\\nSouth Jersey’s my home. Donald Trump’s my president. Melania Trump’s my First Lady. Life is great everyone. God bless you.\\nDonald Trump: (19:42)\\nThank you Kellyanne.\\nDonald Trump: (19:46)\\nI just want to thank Republicans because what they’ve been doing is incredible. Republican leadership in this country we’re winning, winning, winning like never before. We’re winning again and we’ve got a party that’s a very different part, a much stronger party, a much more inclusive party. We have a party that we love. We have a party that has the votes. We have a party like they’ve never had before. The Republican party respected again.\\nDonald Trump: (20:17)\\nI have to say this, America is winning again and America is thriving again like never before. Since the election we have created seven million new jobs. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration, listen to this one, in United States history. That’s a good fact, the lowest in history.\\nCrowd: (20:56)\\n[crosstalk 00:20:56] Four more years.\\nDonald Trump: (21:05)\\nThank you man. We have a great veteran up here and he said, “We love you. We love you.” The veterans. Are we doing good for the veterans? Thank you.\\nDonald Trump: (21:16)\\nAfrican American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country. Ever recorded! Women’s unemployment is at a 65 year low. Sorry about that. Soon it’s going to be historic. Another couple of good months it’ll be historic. 65 years for women.\\nDonald Trump: (21:43)\\nIn the eight years before I took office over 300,000 working age people left the workforce. They had no choice. In just three years of my administration 3.5 million people have joined the workforce. Nobody believes it, including the fake …\\nDonald Trump: (22:03)\\nThe workforce. Nobody believes it including the fake news. If I would have said that during the campaign that we were going to produce numbers like this, the fakeness would have been hitting me. He’s exaggerating. He’s lying, Pinocchio, Pinocchio. The press is very dishonest. More than two million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5% every year, which is a record. A record number of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working, another record. Under the Trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of anybody. You don’t hear that because this is a blue collar boom.\\nDonald Trump: (22:57)\\nIt’s very nice. It’s about time. It’s about time. It’s been many, many decades. Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10%, first time ever. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased, listen to this, by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Median household income is at an all time high. For President Bush, in eight years it was $450, over eight years. Think of this for a second. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, for eight years it was $975, so eight years, eight years, 450, 975 under your favorite President, and when you include the tax cuts, the regulation cuts that nobody’s ever cut taxes like this. Nobody’s ever cut regulations. That’s why all these jobs are being built. Under President Trump, for three years, the number is almost $10,000, and that’s three years, and it’s going up. It’s going up very substantial. That’s a big difference.\\nDonald Trump: (24:37)\\nNew business applications in New Jersey have just soared to a record high, and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare. They’re off. They are off federal welfare. Nobody would’ve believed these numbers. Someday they’re going to write the true story. Our child tax credit alone is delivering $2,200 a year to 40 million American families. We have ended, so importantly for you, the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We don’t need anybody else’s energy anymore. It’s so nice. What happened in the last three years with energy is incredible, but extreme liberals in Washington want to shut down U.S. energy, including through the so-called Green New Deal.\\nDonald Trump: (25:52)\\nClose your factories. Get rid of your cows. You don’t have too many cows in Wildwood, but if you do, they’re gone. We will never sacrifice America’s energy independence. Took us a long time to get there, and we really picked it up over the last three years. What we’ve done is incredible, pipelines all over. Pipelines are good. They’re underground, they’re good, environmentally sound. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most. These are the communities that really have suffered. We created, with the help of a great gentleman from the state of South Carolina, You know who I’m talking about? Tim Scott, right? Senator Tim Scott, he’s an incredible guy. He really is. He came to my office and he had this idea that he’s wanted to do for a long time. Senator Tim Scott, opportunity zones, and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in New Jersey, all over the United States. Billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and not government dollars, they’re flowing into the opportunities zones into areas where investment was dead.\\nDonald Trump: (27:14)\\nFor decades, politicians ran for office promising to protect American workers, but then they went to Washington and they lined their pockets with special address cash, and they shipped American jobs and dreams to other countries. They closed up your factories. They got rid of your jobs. They didn’t have to pay taxes. Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories, steal our farms and ransack our communities. Not anymore, not anymore, because we are defenseless no more because long last you have a President who puts America first. Is that okay?\\nDonald Trump: (28:09)\\nThe United States laws, listen to this number, and you know if it was wrong, the fake news would be all over me, and I’ve been saying it for three years. The United States lost 60,000 factories and plants. Think of that. You wouldn’t think that’s possible because of stupid trade deals, because of bad leadership. During the 16 years of the two prior administrations, under just three years, my administration has now added 12,000 new factories, and many more are being built and they’re pouring back into the United States, because that’s where the action is. That’s where they want to be. They are pouring back into our country, new plants and factories. You see them all over. I passed two of them coming in, brand new, beautiful plants and factories. They’re pouring back in. This is where the action is. This is where they want to be. I see the leaders, they say, “It’s incredible what happened to your country.” I said, “Don’t tell me that. We want you to have your companies build plants in New Jersey and other places,” and that’s what’s happening.\\nDonald Trump: (29:23)\\nBut on no issue have Washington Democrats thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of immigration. Left-wing, radical, politician support deadly sanctuary cities, and remember, a sanctuary city is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody. Instead, they order them to be released into your community. What the hell is going on? What is going on? Once set loose, these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes spree against innocent Americans. Right here in New Jersey, your state’s Democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community.\\nDonald Trump: (30:28)\\nFor example, Cumberland County, we all know Cumberland County very well, right? Good luck with this one. They released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child. He is now at large, free to search for another innocent victim. They didn’t want to give him to ICE, and I want to thank ICE, because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do. Right here, another criminal alien was arrested for a violent assault in New Jersey. The sanctuary jurisdiction of Middlesex County defied the ICE request to detain him. Local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder. I could read these cases, honestly, I could read and state these cases to you all night. I could state these cases to you all night. No American should ever be hurt, harmed or killed because left-wing politicians, Democrats, decided to shield and shelter… Look, look, wait. You have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail. You have criminals that on the street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from. By the way, ICE has removed thousands upon thousands of MS-13 gang members, the most brutal people. You don’t want to do that job. Maybe you do, a couple of tough people up there. Anybody want to be with ICE? You got a lot of tough people in New Jersey. New Jersey is different. I think New Jersey is different.\\nDonald Trump: (32:28)\\nNo, but these ICE people, they love our country. They’re proud and they’re tough people, and they’ll go right into a pack. They call it a pack and they start swinging. Everyone’s swinging or they end up standing up. That’s the end of that, and you know what they do? They bring the MS-13 and many other gang members and other members back to El Salvador, back to Honduras, back to Guatemala, back to Mexico. I want to thank Mexico because you know what’s happening, right? Thousands and thousands at this moment, 27,000 soldiers from Mexico, protecting our Southern border. I want to thank the President.\\nDonald Trump: (33:11)\\nDemocrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order and justice, and say what you want, but those are the facts. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members. We are literally taking them by so many, thousands and thousands, and we’re bringing him back. Thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border, we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row. We have the numbers down by 75% since spring, 75%. We have ended catch and release and really, look, I had another party. I could get anything. If I wanted to spend money on anything, look with the military, we got two trillion dollars, right? More. Two trillion, all made in America, right? Everything. Best planes, best missiles, best everything, made in America. If I wanted to build anything, the only thing they put the whole weight of their party, they didn’t want us to have the wall. They knew it worked. Many of them voted five years ago for a wall. They just didn’t know how to get it built. I do. But what happened is through a series of court cases and other things, the money has won, and we are now building that beautiful wall, and this powerful border wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall, and by next year, we’ll be over 400 miles, and shortly thereafter it will be complete.\\nDonald Trump: (35:21)\\nA lot of people were saying a year ago, “He didn’t build the wall yet. He didn’t build the wall.” Let me tell you. When you have the strength of a party that has the House, okay, hopefully they’re not going to have the House for long. We’ll have a wonderful new speaker, will get rid of Nancy Pelosi, nervous Nancy, nervous Nancy. We’ll have Kevin McCarthy who’s been fantastic. We have to win back the House. But think of this. The wall, so many people were saying, “Build it.” Well, it’s not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the House, not easy. We did it and frankly we were building the wall through the help of the military, the Army Corps of Engineers anyway, but you know what? Now we actually have the money and it’s going up very rapidly.\\nDonald Trump: (36:20)\\nIn all due respect to Mexico, we like Mexico very much, and we’ve gotten along great with Mexico, and the President’s a friend of mine, and I think he’s doing a fantastic job. It’s a tough situation. But Mexico is in fact, you will soon find out, paying for the wall. Okay? They’d hit you with that. Now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico, and it’s an advantage for Mexico, too, when you think about it. The wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities. What we’re doing is stopping drugs at a record number. It’s still anything that comes over is too much, but we’re blocking it at a record number.\\nDonald Trump: (37:03)\\nI’m also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration. We will now be finally able to enforce federal law, and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer funded programs. They were killing our country, killing our country. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now. Frankly, they’re crazy. These people are crazy. They’re taking their cues from socialists like Bernie. Left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health care plans, which many people like. The plans of every Democrat running for President would demolish the economy of New Jersey, where half a million new New Jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies. We have them working at the companies, and we have people getting great health care. It’s been so long. It’s finally working and they want to destroy it. The Republican party will never let it happen. We are saving your health care while the Democrats are trying to take away your health care, take away your doctors, take away all of the good care that we fought, and we fought hard, and we’re doing well and now we’re doing better. By the way, some time prior to the end of the year, we’re putting in for a new middle income tax cut, a very big one. But we’re making health care better and much, much cheaper. We’ve done a great job in running it and we’ve given you a lot of alternatives. We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party, pre-existing conditions, we saved it. We are stopping surprise medical billing and making everything transparent. That’s a big deal, and that will take effect starting in about two months from now. Everything’s transparent. You’ll be able to see pricing. You’ll be able to go and price other hospitals, other doctors. It’s going to be an incredible thing. Nobody believes I was able to do it, but we did it.\\nDonald Trump: (39:50)\\nWe are defending your right to keep the doctor and the plan of your choice. We are lowering drug prices. The Democrats are increasing drug prices. We are fighting the lobbyists and special interests. We are serving you and how are we doing? We’re doing good, right? But because of price transparency, we are getting it done. We’re approving more generic drugs than ever before in the history of our country. That means they come in, frankly, they’re just as good as the big names, but they sell for 80% less in some cases. We are unleashing innovation to cure diseases of all kinds. We are cutting out the rich middlemen and delivering prescription drugs directly to the consumers. These are all things that we had to fight like hell to get.\\nDonald Trump: (40:51)\\nWe’re making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records, which is a big deal for a lot of people. We are prohibiting hospitals from hiding their prices and charging hidden costs. You go home, you say, “Oh, I’m feeling better. The doctor was fantastic,” and then they send you a bill for $25,000. That’s the end of that. All of a sudden the doctor wasn’t so good, right? We are making companies compete for your business. We are repealing burdensome taxes. We have accomplished more than any President in the first three years of their term by far, not even close.\\nDonald Trump: (41:36)\\nWe have provided health insurance options, 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and we have historic investments in treating kidney disease, HIV, pediatric cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. We’re making so much progress. We have just passed a thing that I think is great. I never understood. For 45 years, they’ve been trying to get it passed. We’ve just passed a thing called Right to Try. You know what that is? So, we have the greatest doctors, the greatest technicians, the greatest labs in the world, and we’ll have a drug that’s looking good, but it’s going to take five more years, and by the way, we’ve brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that, but it takes years to get it approved. You have people that are terminally ill. If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe, they go all over the world looking for help. If they don’t have money, they go home and they die. What we did is a thing called Right to Try.\\nDonald Trump: (42:38)\\nPeople sign something and they don’t hold the country responsible. They don’t hold the drug company responsible. It’s called Right to Try, and they get the newest, and the best, and the latest medicine where it’s looking good, but you’re not going to have it for five more years, and you know why they didn’t do it? Because they didn’t want to hurt anybody, except the problem is the people were going to die soon. I said, “They’re terminally ill. Let them have it.” We sat down with a great group of leaders, Republican leaders, and honestly, we had some bipartisan support and we got it done. They’ve been tried to do it for 45 or so years. We got it done.\\nDonald Trump: (43:26)\\nYou have to see the results, and I’ve seen some of the results. Some of the results are incredible. We’ve transformed veteran’s health care, including through VA choice, right? VA choice. For 48 years they’ve been trying to get veterans choice. I thought I had the greatest secret. You know, I haven’t been doing this that long, so four years ago, I’m campaigning for president. Everyone said, “No, he’s only having fun.” Yeah, it’s some fun. This is a lot of fun. Right? But for 45 years-\\nDonald Trump: (44:02)\\nBut for 45 years they’ve been trying to get it Veteran’s Choice. So I come back one day, I say to my people, “I have the greatest idea. I am so smart.” I am like the smart- I have an idea because the veterans are waiting online. They’re waiting online for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, ten weeks. Some are okay and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see the doctors, too long. And I said, “Folks, I have the greatest idea.” All of my people, I say, “I have the greatest idea. I’m so smart. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to send all those people that can’t see a doctor, we just can’t get them to see a doctor. We’re going to send them down the road to private doctors and we’re going to pay the bill and they’re going to get fixed up.”\\naudience: (44:43)\\n[inaudible 00:00:48].\\nDonald Trump: (44:45)\\nRight? So smart. But you see, I said I was smart and they looked back at me and they said, “Sir, we’ve known about that concept for 45 years. We just can’t get it approved.”\\nDonald Trump: (44:57)\\nBut I got it approved. And I got it approved about 11 months ago. And the VA is doing fantastically well. Our veterans are doing great. That was a big thing. That was a big thing. We also got accountability. Where people could mistreat our veterans, do whatever they want, they could be sadistic. They could be so many other things. They could steal, they could rob. You couldn’t do anything, you’d keep them. You couldn’t do a thing. We got accountability. Now you look at him, you say, “Get the hell out of here. You’re fired, you’re fired.\\naudience: (45:38)\\n[inaudible 00:45:37].\\nDonald Trump: (45:38)\\nNow you can fire. They’ve let go of more than 8,000 bad people. We have reduced opioid deaths for the first time, and very substantially, in 30 years. And we are modernizing critical vaccines. We’re doing a great job with vaccines. We are creating a pathway to buy drugs from Canada, that are much, much cheaper, in Florida. Governor Ron DeSantis came to me. He said, “Sir, this system is so bad.” And you can’t fix it unless you have democrat votes, that’s why you got to vote the house. You got to get us back the house.\\nDonald Trump: (46:18)\\nThey say, “Sir, we can buy the drugs in Canada for 50% less.” The same drug made in the same factory, made by the same company. 50% and we can give the benefit for the people that live in Florida, or Colorado, or New Jersey, or wherever you are. This has been going on for a long time. No president has wanted to do it. You know how long it took me to make that decision? I said, “If you can say 50%, or 25%, or 15% buy it. Do it. Go.” And I gave him authorization, “Do it.”\\nDonald Trump: (46:59)\\nWe are protecting Medicare for our nation’s seniors. Democrats want, and you know this, Democrats want to raid Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.\\naudience: (47:12)\\n[inaudible 00:00:47:12].\\nDonald Trump: (47:12)\\nAnd you know, we all have a heart. We all have a heart, but when you tell people to come into our country, like this clown governor of California, come into our country. They’re all going to come. If they think they’re going to get free education, free healthcare, they’re all going to come. If you don’t say it, they’re not going to come. Because who would even think this?\\nDonald Trump: (47:35)\\nVirtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. Ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb, right up until the moment of birth. And that is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.\\nDonald Trump: (48:01)\\nDemocrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. Look at what’s happening to their cities. Los Angeles, it’s so sad. What you see is so sad with the homeless and the way they don’t take care of the homeless. San Francisco, starting in New York. You could take a look at what’s happening to our cities run by Democrats. It’s a disaster. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream.\\nDonald Trump: (48:46)\\nRepublicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. That’s what it is. It’s one of the greatest moments. It’s probably the greatest movement in history.\\nDonald Trump: (49:02)\\nThe 2016 election was probably, I mean you could say, the greatest election in the history of our country.\\naudience: (49:08)\\n[inaudible 00:05:10].\\nDonald Trump: (49:12)\\nAnd now we have to do it again to keep it going. It’s like a giant tree, you plant it, but it takes time to grab on. We need this next election so badly. The good news is, it’s much easier, because here I’ve done it all. I’ve achieved more than I promised. I never told you about Space Force. We got Space Force. I never told you about all of these things that we got. We are a big tent party in the true idea. It’s big ideas, and we have a big future together.\\nDonald Trump: (49:45)\\nThis country has tremendous potential, if we don’t blow it. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we pass bi-partisan, criminal justice reform. They came to me, they couldn’t get it done, including many conservatives. And these people that I fight every day, they came to me, “Help, help, help. Criminal justice reform.” I got it done. As soon as I got it done, they don’t even want to mention my name. I got it done. I got people to vote for it that they could have never gotten. President Obama tried, he couldn’t get it done. President Bush couldn’t get it. They couldn’t get it done. That’s okay. They couldn’t get it done. I got it done. I got it done.\\naudience: (50:24)\\n[inaudible 00:50:25].\\nDonald Trump: (50:30)\\nAnd after I got it done, and I mean solely got it done, and after I got it done they had news conferences. They’re thanking people that I never even heard of. The only one they didn’t think was President Trump. And I got it done, but that’s the way it is. That’s why I always say you have to thank yourself because nobody else is going to do it.\\nDonald Trump: (50:54)\\nWe’re fighting to give school choice to every child in America who needs it. During National School Choice Week, we reaffirmed that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school. School Choice, very important. Democrats don’t want that.\\nDonald Trump: (51:14)\\nTo uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 brand new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. And two great Supreme court justices, two great ones.\\nDonald Trump: (51:40)\\nAs we rebuild our military, we have authorized over $160 million to support our warriors at a place called, huh, McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix. Have you ever heard of those places? Have you ever heard of those places, New Jersey? $ 160 million, two great places.\\nDonald Trump: (52:04)\\nI recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Nobody else was going to do it. They’ve been trying to do that one for 52 years.\\nDonald Trump: (52:23)\\nFor years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Jersey. My friends.\\nDonald Trump: (52:41)\\nAt stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. I really mean that, it’s the survival of our nation. And if you would have had the other party winning this last election, instead of your market being up 72%. Instead of your 401ks being up numbers that you can’t even believe where your wife or your husband says, “Darling, you’re the most brilliant person in history. For years, you’ve been losing your ass with 401ks. Now you’re making a fortune.” Right? Right?\\nDonald Trump: (53:16)\\nNow you’re making a fortune. I have people coming up to me all the time. I had one gentlemen come up, “Sir. Thank you, sir. You’ve made me look so smart. My wife never respected me for anything, not anything. But now she thinks I’m a great investor. Thank you.” 401k.\\nDonald Trump: (53:33)\\nIf you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for it to secure, then we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020. We have to.\\nDonald Trump: (53:46)\\nAnd by the way, when we talk about inheriting victory in 2020 in our Nation, just so you understand, under a big tax cut biggest tax cut plan in history, guess what you have? You have a business, you have a farm, you have a small business, no more inheritance tax, no more what we call death tax.\\naudience: (54:12)\\n[inaudible 00:54:17].\\nDonald Trump: (54:16)\\nSo if you love your children, they won’t have to mortgage the plant. They won’t have to be mortgage the farm, as the expression goes. They won’t have to mortgage anything, there’s no tax. If you don’t love your children, don’t leave it to them and then you do have a problem. No, I’m only kidding. Does anybody here not love their child or their children? Because if you don’t… There’s one man raising his hand. Nah, that’s a big thing. No more estate tax, no more death tax for your small farms and business. Those are things that people don’t even realize.\\nDonald Trump: (54:55)\\nOnly this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And I never even knew the swamp was this bad. Swamp is bad, bad people. A lot of bad people in the swamp.\\naudience: (55:09)\\n[inaudible 00:55:13].\\nDonald Trump: (55:12)\\nBad people in the swamp.\\naudience: (55:13)\\n[inaudible 00:53:47] Drain the swamp.\\nDonald Trump: (55:28)\\nWe got a lot of bad people in that swamp. That swamp, the swamp creatures they call them. They are a [inaudible 00:11:35]. Step by step [inaudible 00:55:39] you thought this was going to be easy, right? A lot of bad people.\\nDonald Trump: (55:43)\\nWith your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That’s what’s happening together in our [inaudible 00:55:55].\\nDonald Trump: (55:56)\\nTogether, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. That’s what’s happening now. We will enact trade deals, the greatest deals ever made. That result in more product proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase “Made in the USA.” Beautiful.\\nDonald Trump: (56:24)\\nFor decades we had politicians that didn’t care about that phrase. That phrase didn’t mean anything to them.\\nDonald Trump: (56:30)\\nWe will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic, can you believe this, in America in 10 years or less. We’ve already started the process. And it could have been started sooner by the past administration, they chose not to do it. I chose to do it. Think of that, ending the AIDS epidemic within 10 years that we’ve started.\\nDonald Trump: (56:56)\\nWe will defend privacy, free speech, religious Liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms, which is under seige.\\naudience: (57:05)\\n[inaudible 00:57:05] USA.\\nDonald Trump: (57:35)\\nBy the way, our second amendment is under siege. In Virginia, they want to take your guns away. It’s just the beginning. Never going to happen as long as I’m President of the United States. That I can tell you.\\nDonald Trump: (57:52)\\nBut above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American ways. And we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag.\\naudience: (58:41)\\n[inaudible 00:14:43].\\nDonald Trump: (58:41)\\nAnd we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God, We Trust.\\naudience: (58:58)\\n[inaudible 00:58:58] Four more years.\\nDonald Trump: (59:15)\\nThank you, everybody. Thank you, very much, everybody.\\nDonald Trump: (59:20)\\nFrom Morristown to Vineland, and Patterson to Pennington. From Camden to Clifton, all the way down the shore to Ocean City and Sea Isle and Stone Harbor. And right here in Wildwood, New Jersey.\\naudience: (59:35)\\n[inaudible 00:59:40].\\nDonald Trump: (59:39)\\nThis has always been the home of the proud, loyal, and very, very incredible Americans. And my friends, so many people in this group, I know them well. They’re tough. They’re smart, they’re great people. It’s called Jersey.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00:02)\\nThis is the state that pioneered the boardwalk, the diner, and the motion picture. And gave the world American greats like Thomas Edison and Frank Sinatra, old blue eyes.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00:16)\\nFrank Sinatra. He was a piece of work, that I can tell you. New Jersey is the state where George Washington led a die hard band of American patriots to victory at Trenton, and Princeton, and Monmouth. In our glorious battle to win American independence, George Washington. This is the state where generations of tough and strong New Jersey craftsmen and dock hands, farmers and factory workers built this country into the single greatest nation on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater and greater every day. It will never be better than what’s coming. There’ll never be anything like what we’re doing.\\naudience: (01:01:01)\\n[inaudible 00:59:29]\\nDonald Trump: (01:01:05)\\nProud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people.\\naudience: (01:01:17)\\n[inaudible 01:01:21].\\nDonald Trump: (01:01:27)\\nWith your help and your devotion, with your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of New Jersey, place I love, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. New Jersey. Thank you. Thank you.\\n

       "2020-01-30  Donald Trump           Donal Trump Iowa Rally Transcript: Trump Holds Rally in Des Moines, Iowa                                                                   Donald Trump: (00:24)\\nI worked so hard for this state. I worked so hard. You just got two of the greatest trade deals, and add Japan to it, by the way. Let’s make it three, 40 billion from Japan, USMCA, all done. China, all done for the farmers. It’s done, that I can tell you. You’re going to have to get bigger tractors and a hell of a lot more land. You’ve got to produce a lot of product. I don’t know if you can, but, hello Des Moines. It’s great to be with you. I’m thrilled to be back in American heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Great people. This November we’re going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street.\\nDonald Trump: (01:25)\\nI mean, I don’t even know. I just saw, New York Times, can you believe? Failing New York Times… When we leave in 10, 14, 18, 22 years from now, the New York Times will be out of business and so will a lot of others. But, did you see they did a New York Times poll, I think, and Sienna, Sienna, New York Times of Iowa, and they have me pitted against every one of the Socialists, and we’re winning by a lot. Everyone. We’re beating them all. We’re beating them all. We’re beating them all. We’re beating them like they haven’t been beaten before. You know all the noises about their crazy debates, nobody’s watching their debates, but it’s all about their debates. They don’t care about the farmer. Everything out here, they love Trump, and you should love Trump with what I’ve done.\\nDonald Trump: (02:26)\\nSo, we’re going to win the great state of Iowa and it’s going to be a historic landslide. If we don’t win, your farms are going to hell. I can tell you right now. Sell, sell, they’ll be saying “Sell.” No, we love the farmers, and we love the ranchers, and we love the manufacturers, frankly. You got plenty of that too in this state. The great state, and you have a great governor, by the way. You have a great governor.\\nDonald Trump: (03:02)\\nBut every day we’re achieving extraordinary victories for the citizens of the Hawkeye State. The Iowa unemployment rate has reached an all time low in history. That’s not bad. That’s not bad. Oh, let’s vote for Pocahontas. Let’s vote for Bernie. Let’s vote for sleepy Joe. He’s falling asleep. Joe, Joe, Joe. He always gets the name wrong. How many times has he missed it? He’s in Iowa. He says, “Great to be in the great state of Ohio.” They say, “Joe, you’re in Iowa.” You can’t do that. No matter how great you speak. If you’re Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech, it’s over. You might as well just wrap it up. There’s the fake news. They would just absolutely destroy you. They would absolutely destroy you.\\nDonald Trump: (04:06)\\nYou can’t do that. You can’t do that, Joe, sleepy Joe, but you have these guys. You have these people. How about Buttigieg? Buttigieg. They call him mayor Pete. You know why? Because nobody can pronounce his name. Nobody has any idea. Buttigieg. They say, “Say edge edge.” He presides over a city that’s failed. It’s doing so badly, in a state that’s having the greatest year they’ve ever had, and they have a great governor also, and they had a great governor. You just heard from him, right? The great state of Indiana, so I don’t see that one. Go down the line. We have some people. Let’s not talk about them. What happened to mini Mike? Where is he? He’s not running. He’s skipping four or five states. Mini Mike. I’ve had him up to here.\\nDonald Trump: (05:05)\\nMore people are working right now in Iowa than ever before. Now think of it. Think of it. Yesterday we replaced a NAFTA disaster with the incredible brand new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement. The USMCA, you know when you have a hard time with that one, memory is a great thing. I’ve always had a great memory for whatever reason, but memory is a great thing. Having a great memory, but sometimes you take little clues. USMCA. Thank you, darling. I love you, too. Where is that person up? Look at that. Wow. What a good, strong voice.\\nDonald Trump: (06:11)\\nBut you know how you remember it? The song I just walked in on. They’re playing the song YMCA. So, when you’re having a hard time, gee, what’s U-S, just think of the song YMCA, and you’ll remember it, USMCA. It’s a massive win for Iowa farmers and workers of all kinds. It’s a massive win and it creates some fairness with Canada. It creates fairness with Mexico. Probably the biggest reason that I ran was the unfair trade that I’ve seen, and one after one, China, Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, we’ve made all these deals, and we have plenty left over. Plenty left over. Europe, Europe, Europe is next. I wanted to finish China before we started on Europe. I like to do them one at a time, one at a time. I’m a very organized person.\\nDonald Trump: (07:15)\\nBut weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with China that will boost American agriculture by $50 billion every year, and many other businesses like manufacturing, banking, finance, overall $250 billion, and you know with the farmers, because I have a place in my heart for the farmers big. I went and I saw Ambassador Lighthizer’s in charge, he’s fantastic. I said, “What are you doing? We’re getting ready for the final deal. What are you doing?” He said, “I’m putting in $20 billion.” Because I asked Sonny Perdue. He’s great. You know who he is, right? Secretary of Agriculture. I said, “Sonny, what’s the biggest number that China’s ever done with the farmers?” He said, “Sir, $16 billion last year. $16 billion.” This was two years ago. I said, “So, $16 billion is the biggest,” because you know, they targeted you, and now we’re friends with China.\\nDonald Trump: (08:10)\\nIn fact, maybe we’ve never had a better relationship and were working with them very closely on the Coronavirus. We’re working with them very, very closely. We only have five people. Hopefully everything’s going to be great. They have somewhat of a problem, but hopefully it’s all going to be great. But, we’re working with China just so you know, and other countries very, very closely, so it doesn’t get out of hand, but it’s something that we have to be very, very careful with, right? We have to be very careful.\\nDonald Trump: (08:42)\\nBut I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, I said, “Sonny, what’s the number?” 16 and 12 the year before, and you were targeted. I don’t blame China. Look, they’re smart. They’re negotiators. They targeted Trump states. Where do they love Trump? They love him in Iowa. They love him in Nebraska. They love him in all these states. They love him in Wisconsin. They love him. We won Wisconsin. They like him and Wisconsin, and a lot of the farm states, and they targeted. The farmers came to see me and they said, “Sir, you have to do what’s right.” When the fake news would interview farmers, the farmers would say, “No, no, President Trump is doing the right thing. It should have been done years ago. Should’ve been done years and years ago.” But you couldn’t have made it because there was too much money, $16 billion. So, what I did is I put a 25% tariff on everything coming in from China, $250 billion, and then more tariffs on things beyond the $250 billion market. We took in billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. We still are, and then what happened? When I heard about the farmers and I saw the farmers, they were in the White House. They came to see me. I had 36 farmers and I said, “I’m going to give you.” They said, “Sir, we don’t want anything.” I said, “What do you mean you don’t want anything? I’ve never heard that before.” Everybody wants money. They want every. They said, “We just want a level playing field.” I never forgot it. They said, “We don’t want anything. We just want a level playing field, and we’ve been treated badly for years, for years.”\\nDonald Trump: (10:24)\\nI said, “Well, you haven’t been given a level playing field for many, many years, for decades. You haven’t been given a level playing field. We’re going to give you the levelest field that you ever had. But, but in the meantime, I’m going to give you $12 billion, out of these tens of billions that we’re collecting.” Don’t worry. We had plenty of left over, because we never got 25 cents from China. China took from us. We didn’t take from China, right? I said, “I’m going to give you $12 billion for the year before, and I’m going to give you $16 billion for this year.” That was last year for this year. So, they got, meaning you, a lot of you in this audience, got $12 billion, and you got 16, so you got $28 billion over that short period of time, and you were able to actually, in some cases, I guess thrive. I told Sonny, “I want to take care of the small farmer too, not just the big monsters. I want to take care of everyone, everyone.”\\nDonald Trump: (11:21)\\nBut, I never forgot when CNN fake news and all these people, they go around interviewing the farmers. They could never find anyone saying bad about Trump. They’d go into diners. “What do you think about Trump? Isn’t it a terrible what he’s doing with the trade?” The farmer would say, “No, he’s doing what should have been done 20 years ago.” Now, you people are going to make so much money. You’re not going to do just, you know what? Just relax. Take it easy. Put it away. Enjoy your life. But you’re going to make a lot of money. You’re going to make a lot of money. Again, we have never had, because they respect us now, they didn’t respect us. We have never had a better relationship with China than we do right now. It’s a beautiful story. They respect us. The whole world respects us now. We’re respected again. America is respected again. Okay?\\nDonald Trump: (12:25)\\nWe’re fighting for products made in America and grown right here in this great, great state of Iowa. To keep America safe, we have fully rebuilt the United States military. It’s now stronger, more powerful, more lethal than ever before. We have all brand new equipment and it was all built in the USA. Thanks to the courage of American heroes, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its founder and leader, the animal known as al-Baghdadi is dead.\\nDonald Trump: (13:17)\\nCrazy Nancy Pelosi said, “Don’t call him an animal. He’s a human being.” No, he’s an animal. He’s an animal. Two weeks ago, at my direction, the United States military delivered another historic win for American justice. Our brave warriors launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. Qasem Soleimani. He was the mastermind of the road side bomb. He loved roadside bombs. When you see your friends and great soldiers of our country and other countries, frankly, walking around, they don’t have legs, they don’t have arms in some cases. Some cases they don’t have both. You see them walking around, or riding around, or the most brave people, these people have the greatest attitude. I go to Walter Reed and I see him and the young man his legs were blown off. “How you doing?” “Sir, I want to get back. I want to get back, sir.” I’ll tell you, the spirit of these people, it may even top the farmers. It may even top the farmers, which is pretty good.\\nDonald Trump: (14:31)\\nBut he was responsible, more than anybody else, 90% they say of these roadside bombs sent to fight us, he was responsible and he took a hard hit. He took a very hard hit. He was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of Americans, and hundreds of thousands of other people. Not acceptable. Soleimani was actively planning new attacks, but we ended his bloody rampage forever.\\nDonald Trump: (15:12)\\nYet, Washington Democrats, true, like crazy Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, opposed our decision to eliminate Soleimani, and to save American lives. That had a tremendous impact. While we’re proudly creating jobs and killing terrorists, Congressional Democrats are consumed with partisan rage, and obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax. You know, we’re having probably the best years that we’ve ever had in the history of our country, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people? I got impeached. They impeached Trump. The best trade deals, the strongest military, I took care of the vets. We got choice. We got accountability for the vets, accountability. We got all these things and they impeach your President. No, that’s not going to work. Watch, just watch.\\nDonald Trump: (16:16)\\nThey want to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow the entire system of government. That’s not happening, I can tell you that. Washington Democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn the last election. Why am I not worried? I should worried. Remember Nixon, it was like a dark period, right? It’s a very dark period. It was like oh, you think about it. Right? With Clinton it was not good. They say that with Johnson, it was a long time ago, none of us remember, but they say it was a very dark period. This is a happy period for us. It’s a happy period. It’s a happy period because we call this impeachment light. This is light.\\nDonald Trump: (17:25)\\nCrazy Schiff. Shifty Schiff. He’s a sick puppy. He’s a sick puppy. But, you know what? Today you saw it, I hit my highest poll numbers since I got elected because the American people, and frankly, people all over the world, know it’s a hoax. They understand it. They know it’s a hoax, and we have a great party, the Republican party. They know what’s going on. They know what’s going on and they’re going to treat us very fairly. But, the Democrats are trying to overturn the last election. We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in 2020.\\nDonald Trump: (18:14)\\nNovember 3, November 3, mark it off. November 3, mark it off. Was that a great day? 2016 November. Remember? He’s not going to do well with this group. I did well. He’s not going to do well with that group. I won that group. He’s not going to do well here or there. Even the exit polls, they took it right up. You know what they didn’t know about the exit polls? When people are leaving, they’re always very accurate. People leave. “Who you voted for?” “I voted for Trump.” “Who you voted for?” “I voted for crooked Hillary. I don’t care that she’s a stone cold crook. I’m voting for her.” Who are you voting for? I’m voting for Trump, or Clinton, or Trump. They’re always very accurate, but this time something happened.\\nSpeaker 1: (19:02)\\nHillary for prison.\\nDonald Trump: (19:03)\\nMany people, many… I like that idea. I like it. I like it. Wouldn’t we like to run against her. who’s tougher? Her, crazy Bernie, Biden, Buttigieg? Who would be the closest? Buttigieg. I don’t know. Maybe we take another crack at crazy Hillary. Would that be okay? She was so easy. Remember that speech so innocently given talking about deplorables. Remember? Remember deplorables? But you know the only thing I didn’t understand, I said, “That’s terrible.” But she said another word that was worse. Irredeemables. I said, “Boy,” shows you how good I am at politics, I said, “She’s in trouble. She said our people are irredeemable.” To me that was worse. Well, it wasn’t that word that caught on. It was deplorable. The next day I’m speaking, and women are walking around, I’m deplorable. Everyone’s got deplorable. I say, “I think she made a bad speech last night.” But irredeemable, remember? She called them deplorable and irredeemable, and me being so brilliant, I said, “I think that irredeemables going to get her.” No, deplorable got her. A lot her like lack of ability.\\nDonald Trump: (20:35)\\nTogether we are going to win back the House. We are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep that beautiful, gorgeous, incredible White House. People don’t realize this is a lot of work. I just left Michigan, and Michigan is booming now because of me, meaning, my people. I say to Prime Minister Abe, he’s a friend of mine, “Shinzo,” Japan, “You got to do something. You got these massive deficits for our country. You got to open up plants in Michigan fast, Shinzo. Fast. You’ve got to do it.” “Yes, I will do it.” He’ll do it, and he’s doing it. Countries are coming in from all over the world. They’re going to Michigan. They’re coming to Iowa. They’re buying your stuff again, like crazy, like crazy.\\nDonald Trump: (21:37)\\nThey’re going to Ohio. They’re going to Pennsylvania. They’re going to South Carolina. They’re going to North Carolina. They’re going to Florida. They’re coming in like never before. They’re all coming back. I ran on the issue trade. I ran on a lot of different issues, but trade was one of them. That was so big. To me, it was so big. I used to say, how do we allow these companies to close, fire everybody, go to another country? Mexico, wherever it may be, make product, sell the product into our country, pay no tax. Who the hell would allow this to happen? Who would allow to happen?\\nDonald Trump: (22:16)\\nIt’s like in South Korea. I went to him, I said, “Listen, your deal is no good. We have to make a new deal.” South Korea, we’re protecting them all, all these different things. I said, “Number one, you’ve got to pay us more.” They agreed to. They gave us $500 million a year more. They said, “But nobody has ever asked.” They gave us 500. That’s nothing compared to what they have to do. That’s okay. That’s okay. They’ll pay more. But you know, they made a trade deal with the United States. Hillary Clinton was in charge of the deal, right? She said it’s going to produce 250,000 jobs, and she was right. 250,000. You know who it was for? For South Korea, not for us, it was for South Korea. So, we renegotiated the deal, if I have your permission, we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with South Korea, okay?\\nDonald Trump: (23:04)\\nThis deal is going to produce, remember… This deal is going to produce 250,000 jobs for South Korea. She didn’t lie. Can’t say she lied. She lies about a lot of other things, but she didn’t lie. How is she taking her defeat? Okay? I think so. Remember the debate? Do you promise if you lose that you will support the winner and I sort of, I didn’t exactly say yes. I didn’t say yes, in all fairness, but I got sort of like six the 68% there. But she said, “See he won’t.” She’s the one that doesn’t do it. No, no, I feel badly because it’s too late for her to get in. I kept hoping, but I think, honestly I think that sleepy Joe, crazy Bernie, I don’t even want to put Buttigieg in, but I think they’d actually be tougher than her.\\nDonald Trump: (24:07)\\nDuring this campaign season, the good people of Iowa have had a front row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left. This is a radical left people that we’re dealing with. Today’s Democrat party, I don’t say Democratic party, it sounds so much better in a speech, right? Democratic party, the Democrat, but that’s not their name. It’s called the Democrat party. You know some people aren’t allowed to say the Democrat party because it doesn’t sound good. I don’t even like it. I don’t like the way it sounds in this speech, but I’m going to say it because I’m not looking to have them look good.\\nDonald Trump: (24:42)\\nToday’s Democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes, increase regulations, cancel your health plans, raid Medicare, shut down American energy, destroy your social security, they will destroy your social security, eliminate religious liberty, punish free speech, confiscate your guns, abolish your borders, and indoctrinate America’s children with hateful, left-wing ideology. Other than that, they’re okay. Other than that, they’re fine people. In short, this election is a choice between American freedom and Democratic socialism, and in some cases, in my opinion, it’s worse than Socialism. Socialism’s a kind word by comparison. The Democrats will lose because America will never be a socialist country. We can’t. They’re all watching tonight. They’re sitting in their hotel room, little hotels right down the street, and they’re looking at this crowd. The press never talks about my crowds. Did you see in New Jersey a couple of nights ago? We had signups for 175,000 people. We had an arena that held about 9,000 people. We could have sold it out 15 times. Okay? They don’t talk about that. You know what they talk about? They said Donald Trump who spoke before a nice crowd. If Bernie or sleepy Joe has, I mean Joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table. No, it’s true. No, they were in a gymnasium. There were in a gymnasium, and they set up a round table, and people that went there to hear his speech are now being asked, “What do you think of socialism?” They just said, “I just want to be here to watch his speech.” They set up a round-\\nDonald Trump: (27:03)\\nThey just said, “I just want to be here to watch a speech.” They set up a round table because the crowd was so small, and then they’ll say, “It was a brilliant round table. It was wonderful.” They never mention crowds. They never mention crowds. They never mention anything. I’ll tell you, U.S.M.C.A, The biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world. Okay? It is, wait. It barely got any mention. We signed it. It barely got any mention. They talk about the impeachment hoax. They talk about all the other stuff, but the trade deal, that is going to change our country. It’s going to bring growth. Wait until you see, toward the end of next year, the growth will be astronomical because of the China Trade Deal, the U.S.M.C.A, Japan, South Korea, Europe, when that happens. It will happen because they have no choice. They have no choice.\\nDonald Trump: (27:55)\\nBut in the papers, and on the fake news cable shows, and the regular, look, NBC is horrible, the NBC Nightly News, it’s terrible. The good news is people don’t watch it like they used to, because they don’t believe in it. They don’t believe in it. And as Sean Hannity would say, MSDNC, you know what MSDNC is, right, so bad. CNN, total fake stuff. Oops, their camera just went off. Look! The camera just went off! CNN!\\nDonald Trump: (28:23)\\nTheir camera just went off. That always happens whenever I say CNN, their camera goes off.\\nDonald Trump: (28:46)\\nBut Americans, across the political spectrum, were disgusted by the Washington Democrats, the partisan hoaxes, the witch hunts, the con jobs. It’s all a con job. And so, they don’t love our country, I swear they don’t. You look at Nancy Pelosi’s district in San Francisco. It was so beautiful, and now it’s a disgrace, being watched all over the world. Needles all over the place, everything else all over the place. I’m not going to get into it, washing down into the ocean, washing down onto their beaches, people living in tents if they’re lucky. I mean you never saw anything, living on their most important entryways into what was a great city, San Francisco. What’s happened? And all she does is work on the hoax and work on all of the stuff.\\nDonald Trump: (29:38)\\nReally, these people are very, very bad for our country. We have to take back the House of Representatives, we have to.\\nDonald Trump: (29:53)\\nRegistered Democrats and Independents are leaving the Democrat party in droves, and we are welcoming these people, and these great voters, to the Republican Party with wide, open arms.\\nDonald Trump: (30:11)\\nAnd we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders, a lot of your really wonderful people. I’m not going to mention all the names, because all those cameras that are rolling, they don’t like it when I do it, but one they don’t mind is Governor Kim Reynolds. Come up, Kim, come up here! Also first gentleman, Kevin Reynolds, Kevin!\\nDonald Trump: (30:48)\\nKim, come on, come on.\\nKim Reynolds: (30:55)\\nDo we love him! Do we love him? Are we going to win Iowa for President Trump? Yes! Four more years!\\nSpeaker 2: (31:16)\\nFour more years! Four more years! Four more years!\\nKim Reynolds: (31:16)\\nYou’re doing great.\\nSpeaker 2: (31:16)\\nFour more years! Four more years!\\nDonald Trump: (31:16)\\nYou want to say something?\\nSpeaker 2: (31:16)\\nFour more years!\\nKim Reynolds: (31:16)\\nNo. On February 3rd, we are going to caucus. On November 3rd, we are going to vote. And on November 4th, we are going to celebrate four more years of President Trump!\\nDonald Trump: (31:40)\\nGreat, great job. Thank you.\\nDonald Trump: (31:42)\\nOh, she was driving me a little bit batty. She would call me up, Kim, you would call. “What about ethanol?” I said Kim, “I mean, I’m doing a lot for that place.”\\nDonald Trump: (31:53)\\n“No, no. We want ethanol.” Then, “we want biofuel.” Then she is asking for things I never even heard of, but we got them all, whatever that hell she wanted, we got. Right? And by the way, Joni Ernst and the great Chuck Grassley are right now in Washington fighting for fairness, fighting the hoax, fighting for all of us. They called, they said, “Do you mind if we don’t go tonight? We have to stay.” I said, “I don’t want you to be there. I want you to be where you are” because they are fighting for us. They are great people. They are great people.\\nDonald Trump: (32:33)\\nAnd, they would call too. Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst, they would call, “We got to help our farmers, sir.”\\nDonald Trump: (32:40)\\n“Yes. Okay, we are going to help the farmer.” They were great. Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg. Thank you, Adam. Thank you, Adam. Great job, Adam. Speaker of the Iowa House of Representatives, a man with really fantastic genes, got to have like the best genes in the world. Although you had an ex-governor here that had very good genes, too. We have his son in the audience, too, but this is Representatives Pat Grassley. Those genes, those two young men have the greatest genes anyone has ever had for politics. Thank you, fellas, thanks. I sent one of them, the father to China, and he’s now Ambassador to China. Do you think he is happy? Is he happy? I think so. I think he is happy. Great Governor, longest serving Governor in history, actually, 24 years. We have the Chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, Jeff Kaufmann. Great job.\\nDonald Trump: (34:01)\\nAnd just quickly, we have the world’s tallest campaign manager, Brad Parscale. And Republican National Committee Co-Chair, who has done an incredible job, Tommy Hicks. And we have the great negotiator, the great man, Bob Lighthizer with us here, someplace. Where’s Bob? What a job he did negotiating for you.\\nDonald Trump: (34:27)\\nAnd we have somebody that you never heard of, somebody that’s a fantastic person, but you never heard of, somebody named Sarah Sanders. Have you ever heard of her? Come here, Sarah! Come on! That’s pretty good! And we have a great football player, from Iowa, Matt Whitaker is here, Matt. Say something.\\nSarah Sanders: (35:16)\\nThank you. How much do we love this president?\\nSpeaker 2: (35:19)\\n[inaudible]\\nSarah Sanders: (35:26)\\nAnd Mr. President, how much do we love the state of Iowa, so much. This is an incredibly special place, I actually met my husband here in Des Moines, so I love being back in Iowa. It is an amazing place. We’re sorry you have had so many crazy, liberal Democrats running around here the last year. But the good news is, it’s not going to matter, because at the end of the day, this guy will still be our president.\\nSarah Sanders: (35:56)\\nThank you very much. God bless you.\\nDonald Trump: (36:02)\\nThank you, Sarah. Very popular. She is a terrific person, great person. Thanks to Republican leadership, American now has the hottest economy anywhere on the Planet Earth, not even close. Every Prime Minister, President, King, Queen, Dictator, whatever you want to call them, they all say, “How did you do it?” And, the truth is we have certain advantages, but we also have a people advantage. We have the greatest people in the world. I really mean that.\\nDonald Trump: (36:34)\\nSince the election, we have created seven million new jobs. The average unemployment rate, under my administration, listen to this, is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. Can you believe that? The lowest unemployment rate. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded, think of that.\\nDonald Trump: (37:11)\\nMore than two million millennials, you know what millennials are, young, great people with a lot of future, they have gotten jobs, and their wages have grown by nearly 5% annually. That’s a record.\\nDonald Trump: (37:28)\\nAnother record is that between the ages of 25 and 34, people are now working, and that’s a record, the number of people, 25 to 34.\\nDonald Trump: (37:41)\\nAnd under the so-called Trump Economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of any group. And that’s a great thing. This is a blue collar boom, and that’s a good thing too. That’s a good thing.\\nDonald Trump: (37:59)\\nEarnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% for the first time ever, for the first time ever.\\nDonald Trump: (38:10)\\nAnd median household income is at an all time high, just for one second, president Bush, eight years, $450. President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years, eight years, $975. President Donald John Trump, two and a half years, not three, because the numbers were taken at two and a half, now it’s actually higher. Two and a half years, including the tax cuts which are massive, and including all of the regulatory cuts, and the other things you have gotten, $10,000. Think of it.\\nDonald Trump: (38:54)\\nYou have eight years, 450. Eight years, 975. Two and a half years, think of it, $10,000. It’s one of the reasons the economy is doing so well. And let the people down the road tell you about that, okay? Let them tell you about that. And those tractors that I told you to buy, your tractors will be 60 years old if they have anything to do with it. They will be 60 years old. They will be old, tired, exhausted. Your land will be exhausted. You will be exhausted.\\nDonald Trump: (39:26)\\nWe’ve ended the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth, by far. We are also proudly promoting American ethanol, and I recently approved E15 to be used all year round! Biofuel also, but the Socialist Democrats want to shut down American energy. They support Representative Ocasio-Cortez.\\nSpeaker 2: (40:07)\\nBoo.\\nDonald Trump: (40:07)\\nIt’s a real beauty. That’s a real beauty. That’s a beauty. I can’t even believe it, but I don’t want to knock it, because the Green New Deal, which would crush our farms, destroy our wonderful cows. I love cows. They want to kill our cows. You know why, right? You know why?\\nSpeaker 2: (40:26)\\nWhy?\\nDonald Trump: (40:28)\\nDon’t say it. They want to kill our cows. That means you are next. And they want to wipe out, totally, Iowa ethanol. They want to wipe it out. But we will never let that side get in, and by the way, that’s the least of it. But I don’t want to attack the Green New Deal, because they might change it.\\nDonald Trump: (40:51)\\nI said to her the other day, they said, “What do you think of the Green New Deal?” I said, “Well, it should be studied carefully. We should look at it, look at it closely. I don’t want to talk about until about two months before the election. And then I will tell you how totally insane it is.”\\nDonald Trump: (41:10)\\nHow about this crazy Senator? How about this crazy, crazy Senator from Hawaii? They said, “I’m totally in favor,” not the smartest. She said, “I’m totally in favor of the Green New Deal.” Well, that would mean there’s no more airplanes. “Oh!” They started screaming at her in Hawaii, they said, “How the hell are we going to get to Hawaii?” They said, “We’re going to build a railroad.” She said that would be “the world’s longest track.” It’s the world’s longest. She doesn’t know that they don’t want airplanes anymore, and yet they fly around in brand new Gulfstreams, in brand new planes all over the place. They’re flying from place to place. They’re talking about the carbon footprint. “We’re going to destroy the carbon footprint! What time is my plane taking off, please?”\\nDonald Trump: (42:04)\\nTo lift up forgotten communities, the Republican tax cut launched Opportunity Zones, jobs, and investment, and now rushing into over 60 newly… and this is incredible, brand, newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Iowa alone. Rich people are investing vast amounts of money. Tim Scott, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, came into my office. He said, “I have an idea that I have wanted to do for years, but we have never had a president that could pull it off.” I said, “What is it, Tim?” And he talked about Opportunity Zones, first time I heard it. And we did it, and there is nothing, nobody has ever seen anything like it. Money is being poured into these communities that would have never been there. What’s happening is incredible. Opportunity Zones. Remember it.\\nDonald Trump: (42:51)\\nFor decades, politicians ran for office, promising to protect American farmers and workers. You’ve heard it all your lives, right? But then, they went to Washington. They looked at those beautiful marble columns, and that gorgeous ceiling painted, and all that gold, the way they used to build the buildings, they don’t build them that way anymore. We could, but they just don’t know how. By the way, we’re building the wall. You know the wall is over a hundred miles long. It’s over a hundred miles long already and moving fast.\\nDonald Trump: (43:25)\\nThey went to Washington and they sold you out. That’s what happened. They sold your jobs out. They sold everything out. Globalist politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories, ravage our farms, rob our workers, and ransack our communities. But the era of economic surrender is over, because now we are finally putting America first, America first.\\nSpeaker 2: (44:10)\\nU.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A.\\nDonald Trump: (44:10)\\nBefore I took office, Washington looked the other way, while China stole our secrets from American agriculture. Your business, what they do scientifically, nobody understands what they have done to a seed. It doesn’t sound complicated. It is genius, what they have been able to do, what you have been able to do. But those secrets were being stolen, stolen. And installed massive barriers to your exports. You couldn’t do anything with exports, so people, not only China, many, many other places were stealing your secrets.\\nDonald Trump: (44:42)\\nOur new agreement with China will protect our intellectual property and pry open vast new markets for American beef, pork, poultry, seafood, soybeans, rice, dairy, and much, much more.\\nSpeaker 3: (44:54)\\nI love you Donald Trump!\\nDonald Trump: (45:03)\\nBut you know it is true. China is so big. 1.5 billion people. We have 350. 1.5 billion people, think of that, and we are just touching it. This deal will be so big. If it all works out, and you have the best product, the best product in the world, if it all works out, it will just keep expanding. 250 billion will end up being much, much more than that.\\nDonald Trump: (45:35)\\nAnd, I’ve told this story before, when we were signing, we were almost finished and I said, “How much are the farmers getting?” Meaning how much are they going to purchase from the farmers. And Ambassador Lighthizer said, “We put 20 billion, sir. The highest ever was 16, so we made it 20.” I said “Make it 50.” They said, “What?” And then people, even farm people, said, “Sir, we can’t produce that much.” I said, “That’s a good problem, not a bad problem.” I said, “Make it 50,” so we now have, in the contract, from 40 to $50 billion worth of purchase.” Make it 50, make it 50! Right, Jared? I said, “Jared, you better make it 50.”\\nDonald Trump: (46:23)\\nI want those farmers to come back, say, “Sir, sir, we can’t do it. We can’t produce that much, sir, what are you doing to us?” I don’t think that would ever happen? Do you think that would ever, I said they will figure a way. He’s going “Absolutely not.” Nah, I said, “Don’t make it 20, make it 50.”\\nDonald Trump: (46:40)\\nThe U.S.M.C.A. is another colossal victory for American agriculture like you have never had before. It’s time. We suffered for a year and a half, almost two years. Think of it, but not really because I was able to give you those, I won’t call them subsidies. I made that mistake once with the farmers. I said to this group of farmers that came in, “Subsidy.” I used the word subsidy. That was the worst word, “Sir, we don’t watch subsidy! Please don’t ever use that word.” I said, “I won’t, I promise.”\\nSpeaker 3: (47:04)\\nAmen!\\nDonald Trump: (47:06)\\nBut we helped. And it will increase total agriculture exports by more than $2 billion annually. Think of that, including the huge dairy in Iowa, dairy, pork and poultry alone, so two billion just in those small [inaudible 00:47:23]. Just in that small, little grouping where you were doing nothing. It’s called promises made, promises kept. Promises met.\\nDonald Trump: (47:42)\\nThe last time I came, I never did this before, I never ran, so they all said, “You never ran before. You can’t do this if you never ran,” so whatever happened, it happened. One by one, they started dropping out, right? And then I was left with one, Hillary Clinton, and that worked out very nicely. “He cannot get to 270,” remember? 270, electoral college. “He cannot get to 270.”\\nDonald Trump: (48:10)\\nI went to Maine. It’s true, Maine, too. It’s got one point, right, one. I went there a lot, many times. Everyone said, well, they kept getting me, maybe if I have a great night, 269, but 269 loses. Right? But we got 306 to 223. 306, 223, so they were right, “You cannot get to 270, you can get to 306,” but not that there is…\\nDonald Trump: (48:44)\\nIn the eight years before my election, net farm income plummeted by 20%, you know that. If you look at a chart, for 15 years actually, not eight, for 15 years, it’s like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer. Soybeans. Take a look at it all. It was just a one way street. Everybody was ripping off the American farmer. Now you’re going to see numbers that are going to be great. Look at even what’s happened recently. It’s incredible what’s going on and I love it, because you deserve it. You suffered a lot, with people that were stupid. They were stupid! Under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50% and will now be rising even faster. What are you going to do? You are going to vote for Bernie? You are going to vote for Bernie?\\nDonald Trump: (49:37)\\nHere I am on the debate stage, “Well, net income has gone up for the farmers 50%.” Tell me, how the hell do I lose this debate? How do I lose? And based on the polls, I guess I’m not going to lose in this state. I don’t think I will lose in any other state either. Because this is really true all over the country. This is happening all over the country, not just Iowa.\\nDonald Trump: (50:02)\\nOn no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than on immigration. Illegal immigration costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars, drains public services, overcrowds our schools and hospitals, and threatens innocent American lives at a number that you wouldn’t even believe. But we have got it closed up, but we’re getting your people in. You have people that have worked for you for a long time, don’t you? I know who the people that you have, and they are hard workers. We have a lot of great people. You have a lot of great people out there. Right here in Des Moines, a twice deported, illegal alien was charged with shooting and killing a woman, her 11-year-old daughter, and her five-year-old son.\\nDonald Trump: (50:45)\\nIn this region of the county alone, last year, ICE officers arrested nearly 4,000 illegal aliens charged or convicted of heinous crimes, including robbery, rape, and murder.\\nDonald Trump: (50:58)\\nYet today’s Democrat Party glorifies illegal immigration. We have no idea, now we do now, but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands. We have no idea who they are. Many are fine people and all of that, but some are stone cold rapists, and murderers, and people that their countries don’t want, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and even Mexico. Right now we have a love affair with Mexico because the Democrats, the Democrats wouldn’t give us what we needed and I got Mexico, they’re great. They put up 27,000 soldiers on our Southern border and the numbers are plummeting, 87% down.\\nDonald Trump: (51:47)\\nThe president of Mexico is doing a great job. And we ended Catch and Release. You think that was easy? Catch and Release, you know what Catch and Release is? You catch a criminal, you take the number, and you release him into the, they would never come back. We say, come back please in three years, this is a Democrat deal. Come back if you don’t mind, in three years. We release them into our country. We totally ended it through a very, very slick group of rules. Catch and Release. May we please have your address and your phone number? “Here it is!”\\nDonald Trump: (52:24)\\n“What have you done?”\\nDonald Trump: (52:26)\\n“I got out of jail.”\\nDonald Trump: (52:28)\\n“Oh, well, welcome to the United States. Please, we have a little information. Okay, and now we’re going to release you, and in three and a half years, we schedule a court appearance for you.” Do you believe, this is the only country in the world. They catch somebody on the border. You’re supposed to be Perry Mason. You take them to court. Other countries catch somebody at the border. They say, ” Sorry, you got to get out.” We say, “Oh, may we have your information? We’re taking you to court.” Man.\\nDonald Trump: (52:57)\\nToday’s Democrat Party glorifies illegal immigration, vilifies the heroes of law enforcement, and pledges to dissolve immigration control entirely. They want open borders. They want hundreds of thousands of people to flow into our country. And some of those people, some of those people are stone cold killers. Some of those people, in the caravans, right? I came up with that name but they won’t give me credit for that. They don’t give me credit for anything. They don’t give me credit for fake news. Wasn’t that my term? Now they say, I see CNN, they said, “Fake news has reported,” no, no, you are fake news, that fake news is you. You are fake news.\\nDonald Trump: (53:43)\\nThey turned the term around. They are reporting that fake news is reporting their fake news. Left wing politicians even support deadly sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into American communities. We don’t want them. In New York City, the Mayor’s Sanctuary Policy recently forced the release of a-\\nDonald Trump: (54:03)\\n… the mayor’s sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a criminal illegal alien charged with assault. After being set free the same criminal raped, brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman. They wouldn’t give him to the ICE warriors. Their warriors. They’re tough and they love our country. They’re very tough and they love our country. They’re taking MS-13 gang members … They’re about as tough as you get, they’re taking them out of our country by the thousands. By the thousands. That’s a tough job but they love to do it. They love our country.\\nDonald Trump: (54:43)\\nSanctuary city policies aren’t just wrong, they’re immoral, and they’re lethal, and they really are something that has to be stopped. They have to be stopped now. What’s happening is a disgrace.\\nDonald Trump: (54:57)\\nThankfully here in Iowa your great Republican governor, sometimes referred to as Governor Reynolds, signed a state-wide ban on sanctuary cities. Thank you Kim. That is why we need to elect more Republicans nationwide, to end sanctuary cities in all 50 states. Thank you Kim Reynolds. You know I endorsed her, so I want to take full credit for the job she has done. I endorsed her very early, right? Very early I endorsed her. I know talent. She’s done a great job.\\nDonald Trump: (55:44)\\nDemocrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order, and justice. It’s true. We are finding the illegal game members, drug dealers, predators, and we are throwing them the hell out of our country, ideally. We don’t want to put them in prison because you know what? We got to pay for them for the next 50 years, but sometimes we have to. If they’re too dangerous we have no choice.\\nDonald Trump: (56:15)\\nThanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row, and they’re getting lower, and lower. Shockingly, as that wall gets longer, the crossings get less. Remember the Democrats? “You don’t need a wall. You don’t need a wall. You don’t need it.” Seven years they all voted for it, they just didn’t have the ability to build it. You know it’s not easy with land, and this, and that, and property, and rights. They couldn’t figure it out but I can figure it out. The problem was we couldn’t get the money, but we got all the money we need now. We have everything. We have everything. The last time, this last budget, they didn’t really fight us on the wall. You know why? Because they learned it’s a really bad issue for them. It’s a really bad issue. But I made one mistake with the wall. I should have said, “We will never ever build a wall.” They would have given me so much money to build a wall. That was my only … Because I used to go, “We will build the wall,” right? That was a mistake. I should have said, “We will never ever build it. Under no circumstances,” and they would have forced its building and I would have said, “Okay.”\\nDonald Trump: (57:39)\\nBy the way, in all due respect, you know who’s going to pay for the wall, right? No, no, they play … The fake news plays. No, no, through remittance illegal aliens from Mexico are going to pay for the call. That’s what it is. Remittance. 100% because when I say something I mean it. I said I was going to build a wall.\\nDonald Trump: (58:03)\\nYou think it’s easy when you have a party that controls the House, you got to end that. You got to end that. They said they picked up the House in ’18 but I didn’t run in ’18. You know the big difference when you run, ’16 I ran, ’18 I didn’t run. They did, they picked up some seats. I didn’t run, but I’m running this time and we’ve got to take back the House. Kevin McCarthy will be a great Speaker of the House. Kevin McCarthy will be a great Speaker, watch.\\nDonald Trump: (58:33)\\nBut getting something built when you have a party that controls one of the three, getting it built is … Honestly I don’t want to brag, nobody else could have done it. Nobody else could have done it. It’s The Real Deal wall. It’s the wall that border security wanted. Remember I thought I could just build concrete slabs? They didn’t want that because you have to be able to see through. I said, “Oh come on.” This is the expensive version. This is the best version. This is steel, and concrete, and rebar in between. It’s really something.\\nDonald Trump: (59:08)\\nDid you see the other day where drug dealers got caught at the top? They couldn’t get over. We had to get the fire department to get them down. They couldn’t get over and they’re like mountain climbers. They got used to climbing. They got caught because you know that panel? That’s an anti-climb panel. It’s very hot and very tough. It’s a very hard panel to climb, the panel on top. Sometimes I’d say, “I’d rather do without that panel,” because I’m a very visual person. They said, “Sir that’s anti-climb panel.” I said, “Oh it is? Okay, let’s put it on. To hell with it.” It’s true. Anti-climb panel.\\nDonald Trump: (59:45)\\nThe wall is the top of the line. That’s what they wanted. Mostly 30 feet tall. That’s very tall. That’s maximum. It’s really doing a big trick. A lot … Wherever we have it … 100 miles is all of a sudden a lot, but where you have that it’s incredible. 99.9%, especially when we’re watching it. We’re watching the sections.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00:05)\\nIllegal crossings now are down 75% since last spring. The powerful border wall was starting to set. I mean pretty soon we’ll be setting records in speed. It’s going up very rapidly. Very rapidly. You’re seeing it all over and it’s going to be really something. Look, it would be nice if we didn’t have to have it. It would be great, but we have to have it. They said, “Oh we could have drones.” Oh what are you going to do with drones flying around? When people are going through your border with nowhere … They’re going to have drones flying around. They know because they were all for it. They were all for it. Now all of a sudden they’re against, but they want drones. Well we’re going to have drones too but the drones are policing the wall.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00:49)\\nIn terms of human trafficking, people don’t even talk about it. Because of the internet, sadly, the worst in the history of our world. All over the world. Trafficking in women and children all over the world. All over the world. The worst it’s ever been, but when we have this border it makes it very, very tough for them to come into the United States with women and with children stuffed in trunks in the back of a car.\\nDonald Trump: (01:01:20)\\nThe Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders’ government healthcare takeover bill. It’s a takeover of your healthcare that would strip all of those 180,000 million great Americans of your private coverage. You want that. You got great deals. You’re able to negotiate, you’re able to keep your doctor, keep your area, keep your hospitals, keep everything that you wanted. Now they want to take it away. Report to an operating room when you have a cold, okay? In your local hospital. I don’t think so. 180,000 million people, but I’m not going to knock it because I want Bernie to bring it right up to the end and we’ll debate it the day before the election. Okay? We are saving your healthcare while Socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare.\\nDonald Trump: (01:02:14)\\nSleepy Joe has no idea what he’s even … He doesn’t even know what he’s talking about. He’s so lost. Honestly, that poor guys is so lost. They talk healthcare, she said, “It’s over for him.” It was over for him, actually if you knew him, a long time ago. Now it’s really over.\\nDonald Trump: (01:02:31)\\nWe are making healthcare better and cheaper. We got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed Obamacare. We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party. We’re stopping surprise medical billing and making everything totally transparent. I signed it already. Everything now is going to transparencies, where hospitals, doctors, everybody has to tell you how much things are costing. Watch those prices come down. Right? Right?\\nDonald Trump: (01:03:17)\\nI have an expert on healthcare. He said transparency because it’s a big deal. It’s a big deal. Nobody else would have gotten it done, that I can tell you. Transparency is bigger than healthcare because you will see prices tumbling like you wouldn’t believe. People go in for a blood test, they get charged $2,700. Down the road they get the same test for $57. The same exact test. Maybe it’s better. Maybe it’s better. It’s crazy. When you have transparency it’s all going to come. You watch. You watch. But this person, a real expert, said, “This is bigger than healthcare,” and I got it done. Unfortunately it won’t really start kicking in until after the election because it takes a period of time. They have certain statutory requirements, et cetera.\\nDonald Trump: (01:04:02)\\nWell you better let me win. Can you imagine? Can you imagine? I did transparency, I took the guts, I did transparency and then I’m going to watch as somebody else says, “Didn’t he do a great job for transparency?” You better let me win because I want the credit for that one.\\nDonald Trump: (01:04:19)\\nWe’re buying cheaper drugs from other countries and approving more generic drugs than ever, ever, ever before. We are defending your right to keep the doctor. We are defending your right to keep your plan. Remember Obama 28 times, “You can keep your doctor. You can keep your doctor”? 28. “You can also keep your plan. You can keep it. You can keep it.” 28 times he lied. We should impeach him. No, he got it on a lie. He got it on a lie, but we’ve run it much better. But essentially it’s totally different because of individual mandate. Because that really took the guts out of it and we’re running it much better.\\nDonald Trump: (01:05:04)\\nI had a choice, do we run it well or do we run it poorly? If we run it poorly everyone’s going to blame me. If we run it well everyone’s going to give him credit, especially the fakers back there right? But you know what? We got to run it well but we’re coming up with a healthcare that if we win the House we will have the best healthcare of any country in the world, by far.\\nDonald Trump: (01:05:29)\\nWe’re fighting the lobbyists and we’re fighting the special interest, in case you didn’t notice. We are serving only you. Thanks to our bold reforms we’re now offering health plans that are 60% cheaper than Obamacare. We’re offering a lot of different things. We have just passed, recently, 10 months ago, Right to Try. I love Right to Try.\\nDonald Trump: (01:05:52)\\nYou know what that is? That’s people are terminally ill and they can’t use medicine because … They’ve been trying to pass this, almost for 50 years. You can’t use the medicine. We have the greatest doctors, labs, hospitals in the world. They come up with a medicine but it has to go through the FDA procedure, right? You can’t do anything. You can’t use it. They won’t let you use it. Now I have you sign an agreement, you’re not going to sue the United States, you’re not going to this, your family, et cetera, et cetera. Very simple. And they can use it. You have no idea the results that are taking place. You have no idea. You have no idea the results. People’s lives are being …\\nDonald Trump: (01:06:35)\\nFor me it was simple. I said, “Wait a minute, you’re worried about hurting somebody? These people are dying. They’re terminally ill. They’re admitting they’re terminally ill and you won’t let them use a drug that may work? Let the use the drug.” And we’re letting them use the drug and it’s working in a lot of cases.\\nDonald Trump: (01:06:57)\\nWe have transformed veterans healthcare, including VA Choice. The best. You know I think I’m a totally brilliant human being. I think I’m the smartest person, so I came up with a plan. I’ll never forget, I was in New Hampshire, I came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and saying, “Sir it’s really terrible what’s happening with healthcare. We’re waiting in line for two weeks, for four weeks, for seven weeks.” Honestly people were waiting in line, they weren’t very sick, they were terminally ill, truthfully, before they saw a doctor. By the time they got to the doctor. So I came up with this incredible plan. Only I could think of this. I said, “Here’s what you do … Here’s what you do, if somebody can’t get a doctor quickly,” because we have great doctors at the VA. They don’t get enough credit. “If you can’t get to a doctor quickly you go outside, you go locally, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get yourself all better.” Right?\\nDonald Trump: (01:07:50)\\nSo I went back. I went back and I told my people, “Do you have any idea how smart I am? Listen to this plan I have.” They said, “Actually sir we’ve known about that plan for 52 years we just couldn’t get it approved.” So I said, “Oh that’s too bad, I thought it was brilliant,” but what I am good at is getting things approved and I got it approved. People are using it and it’s great.\\nDonald Trump: (01:08:19)\\nI know the people of Iowa don’t care about this but we are making substantial investments in rural healthcare. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. That’s a great thing. Our great first lady is helping us with that. That is such a big thing for Melania. Big, big thing. She is really involved.\\nDonald Trump: (01:08:51)\\nWe will never let the Democrats give away your healthcare to illegal immigrants, especially when we say, “Come in. Come in, we’ll give you healthcare.” It’s one thing they come in and it’s a rough situation because we all have hearts but when people are saying, like in California this wacky governor he says, “Come in, we’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you free education. We’re going to give you everything. We’re going to give you a beautiful Rolls-Royce.” See to show you how fake they are one of the newscasters said, “Donald Trump said that the governor of California promised a Rolls-Royce to illegal immigrants. He didn’t promise them. This was a lie and a misrepresentation by President Trump.” They can’t take a little humor. They can’t take it. These people are sick. They’re sick. No. They’re sick people.\\nDonald Trump: (01:09:51)\\nThem and Shifty Schiff is a very sick person. He lies awake at night shifting and turning, Shifty. Shifting and turning in his bed, sweating like a dog. “How am I going to get him? He didn’t do anything wrong, how am I going to get him?” Oh what a sick guy he is.\\nDonald Trump: (01:10:09)\\nVirtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion. Ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb. Right up until the moment of birth. That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, Socialism, and blatant corruption. No matter how you cut it, that’s what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. You know that, right? Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe.\\nDonald Trump: (01:11:17)\\nRemember I always said, “I can be more presidential than any other past president, other than perhaps Abraham Lincoln when he’s wearing the hat,” right? Because it’s easy to be presidential but only have about three people in front of me. Be a, “Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Is everything okay in Iowa? Oh I see, the world is ripping you off. Well there’s not a thing I can do about that. Thank you. Good night everybody. Good night.” No, we got to do it the right way. Republicans …\\nDonald Trump: (01:11:52)\\nAnd by the way, can I be honest? Doing this takes far more talent than doing that. Doing that is very easy. This is not easy. Especially when you just left Michigan, and you just left other places, and you got maniacs doing a number on you all the time for three years. You got the maniacs for three years. I think before I came down the escalator with our future first lady I think really they were doing it then. They started even before I came down on the escalator. These people are maniacs, so you have all that. So you’re fighting that and you’re doing farm bills.\\nDonald Trump: (01:12:28)\\nWe got your farm bill approved by the way. We got your farm bill approved. I don’t even mention that because that’s massive by any other standard, but it’s peanuts compared to the USMCA and the China deal, right? So I don’t even mention it.\\nDonald Trump: (01:12:41)\\nAnyway, Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. It’s true. Our numbers with African American workers, people, are through the roof. Are through the roof because … Remember I used to say, “What do you have to lose?” I’d read the down the worst on crime, the worst on education. They got this, they got that, they got 10 different things, all horrible. One day I’m in front of this tremendous group of people and I’m reading this list, African American, they have the highest crime rate, they have the highest this, they have the worst education, they have the worst schools, they have the worst … I said, “Stay with me,” because they were with the Democrats for a hundred years, more. I said, “Stay with me. What the hell do you have to lose?”\\nDonald Trump: (01:13:33)\\nYou know what? You know what? Remember that? Now they have the best employment and unemployment numbers, they have the best poverty numbers, they have numbers that nobody would believe. They’re doing so great. It’s so great to see it. It’s incredible. Youth unemployment, African American youth. It’s been great.\\nDonald Trump: (01:13:58)\\nWe’re asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are a big tent and a big party with big, bold, beautiful ideas for the future. We’re what the country was based on originally. It was called greatness. It was called greatness.\\nDonald Trump: (01:14:21)\\nDuring National School Choice Week, School Choice everybody, we continue our fight to rescue children trapped in failing government schools. Iowa became one of the first states to pass School Choice. That was over 10 years ago. Now Governor Reynolds, Senator Ernst, Senator Grassley, and more than 100 members of Congress are supporting our plan to give School Choice to every child in America who needs it. It’s a great plan.\\nDonald Trump: (01:14:52)\\nTo give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed criminal justice reform. Think of that. Think of that. We had a lot of great Conservatives who wanted it, we had Liberals who wanted it. They couldn’t get it passed. President Obama couldn’t even come close. He didn’t try too hard. He talked like, “Oh I’ll try.”\\nDonald Trump: (01:15:15)\\nTo uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges, a record, who will interpret The Constitution as one. And two great Supreme Court justices, by the way. As part as … Right? Two great ones.\\nDonald Trump: (01:15:39)\\nAs part of my commitment to rebuild our military we secured an $8.5 million facility to support our Iowa Guardsmen at Camp Dodge, right here in Des Moines, Iowa. Right here, Camp Dodge. Camp Dodge everybody. We take care of Camp Dodge.\\nDonald Trump: (01:16:01)\\nI recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Yesterday we just released a historic new plan for peace. We’re going to see if we can get that done. It’s one of the toughest deals of all. One of the toughest deals but we have a shot at it.\\nDonald Trump: (01:16:29)\\nFor years you watched as your politicians apologized for our country. They apologized. They would say, “I’m sorry.” Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Iowa. We are standing up for Iowa.\\nDonald Trump: (01:16:50)\\nAt stake in our present battle is the survival, frankly, of our nation. Look, I can make this speech really short. All I have to do is say, “Hello Iowa, you have no choice. You have to vote for me. Otherwise everything that you’ve built in your entire life will be gone. Goodbye Iowa, have a good time.” Instead I work my ass off up here, okay? Yeah. True. Do you think this is easy? It’s a little hot in this room. This room wasn’t designed for this many people.\\nDonald Trump: (01:17:33)\\nIf you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020. We have to.\\nDonald Trump: (01:17:51)\\nBy the way, for those beautiful farmers that want to leave your small farms or businesses to your children … Because of our great tax bill, the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, the biggest that you benefit by. Because of that there is no death tax or inheritance tax, as they call it. So I always say, “If you love your children that’s a great thing. If you don’t love your children don’t leave it to them and that particular tax won’t matter,” but if you love … Is there anybody here that does not love your children? Is there anybody here who loves your children? Well it’s Iowa. It’s Iowa. You love your children. You know you have no tax to pay, you leave your …\\nDonald Trump: (01:18:43)\\nIn the old days, meaning before Trump, what would happen? You’d leave your farm, they’d assess your farm for a massive amount that kids would go out to a bank, they’d borrow money up to their eyeballs and they’d end up losing the farm. Now you can leave your farm … And they did that to pay the tax. Now you can leave your farm, you don’t pay inheritance tax or [inaudible 01:19:03]. No, it’s great. So when you’re looking down at your children you’re saying, “Oh did you get lucky? Did you get lucky? Look at them, they’re enjoying life.”\\nDonald Trump: (01:19:19)\\nBut only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. That swamp is bad. That swamp is bad. I had no idea it was going to be this sick and this degenerated. It’s a degenerate swamp. I had no idea. When I came out, I said, “We’re going to drain this swamp.” I had no idea that the swamp was that evil, but we’re winning. We’re winning because we’re in The White House. We’re winning.\\nDonald Trump: (01:19:49)\\nWith your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependents to independents, and poverty to prosperity. That’s what’s happening all over our country. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. It’s already happening. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products made, raised, farmed, and grown right here in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. We’ve already started.\\nDonald Trump: (00:00)\\nShould have been started in the last administration. Incredible. Should have been started earlier, but we started. In less than 10 years, the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated, will be gone. Who would have thought that was possible? When they came in and told me that a couple of years ago, I said, “Really? Nobody knows that.” Incredible the strides that we’ve made.\\nDonald Trump: (00:26)\\nWe will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. In the state of Virginia they want to take your guns away, you believe it? Virginia, I love Virginia. Of all states, they want to take your guns away. The Democrats. Not going to happen.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00)\\nAbove all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We are one great America. We support, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that family and faith, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way, not government bureaucracy. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust. We live by those words, in God we trust.\\nDonald Trump: (02:05)\\nFrom Cambridge, good old Cambridge. Who’s from Cambridge here please? Cambridge. What the hell do I mention it for when there’s two people here? Can I say it anyway? I’ll say it anyway. Good place Cambridge. Good, he said it’s amazing. Well, from Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids where I made my last speech prior to the election. What a place, 32,000 people. I said, “I’m going to win tomorrow.” To Rock Rapids, from Melbourne to Moorhead, and from Davenport to right here in Des Moines, Iowa. We stand on the shoulders of true red blooded American heroes.\\nDonald Trump: (02:54)\\nThis great state was founded by tough, tough, tough frontier men. These are tough people. Let’s see how big and how tough. They’re tough. Anybody like to join ICE? You want to join ICE? He says, “No thank you.” And strong pioneer women who defied the dangers to carve out a life and a beautiful home with great families and great neighbors. They tamed the wilderness, braved the elements, tilled the soil, planted the fields and help make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are making it greater and greater every single day.\\nDonald Trump: (03:54)\\nProud citizens like you helped to build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, where it has always belonged. It’s coming back to you, you see that. With your help, your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working and we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen, and especially the great ladies and gentlemen of Iowa, the best is yet to come. True, true. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you.

       "2020-02-04  Democratic Candidates  Transcript: Speeches at the Iowa Caucuses – Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar Speak  Bernie Sanders: (00:08)\\nThank you. Thank you. Let me begin.\\nBernie Sanders: (00:24)\\nLet me begin by stating that I imagine, have a strong feeling that at some point, the results will be announced. When those results are announced, I have a good feeling we’re going to be doing very, very well here in Iowa.\\nBernie Sanders: (00:52)\\nAnd the message that Iowa has sent to the nation, it’s a message shared by the American people, is that we want a government that represents all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors and the 1%.\\nBernie Sanders: (01:12)\\nTonight in this enormously consequential 2020 election, the first state in the country has voted and today marks the beginning of the end for Donald Trump, the most dangerous President in modern American history. You know, no matter what our political views may be, the people of America understand we cannot continue to have a President who is a pathological liar, who is corrupt, who does not understand our constitution, and is trying to divide our people up based on the color of their skin, based on their religion, their sexual orientation or where they were born. And all of that hatred, all of that divisiveness, is going to end when together we are in the white house.\\nBernie Sanders: (02:54)\\nWe are going to win this election because the people of the United States are sick and tired of a massive level of income and wealth inequality. They don’t want tax breaks for billionaires and cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The American people understand that if you work 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty, and that we’ve got a raised up minimum wage to at least 15 bucks an hour.\\nBernie Sanders: (03:40)\\nThe American people understand that health care is a human right, not a privilege. And that our administration is going to take on the greed and corruption of the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry. And whether they like it or not, we will pass a Medicare for all single payer program.\\nBernie Sanders: (04:19)\\nThe American people understand that in the year 2020 all of our people, regardless of income, are entitled to get a higher education. And that is why together we will make public colleges and universities tuition free, and why we will cancel all student debt in America. And we’re going to do that through a modest tax on Wall Street speculation. Eleven years ago, we bailed out the crooks on Wall Street. Now it is their time to help the middle class.\\nBernie Sanders: (05:18)\\nAnd unlike the President of the United States, the American people understand that climate change is not a hoax, but is an existential threat to our country and the entire world. They understand that the time is now for us to take on the fossil fuel industry, to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energies. And as President of the United States, because this is a global issue, not just an American issue, we are going to speak to the people in China and Russia and countries all over this world and say, maybe just maybe instead of spending 1.8 trillion dollars a year on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.\\nBernie Sanders: (06:33)\\nAnd the people of America know the time is long overdue for major reforms to a broken and racist criminal justice system. We’re going to invest in our young people in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.\\nBernie Sanders: (07:05)\\nAnd the American people also understand that our immigration system is broken, and together we will pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship.\\nBernie Sanders: (07:23)\\nAnd the American people know that gun safety legislation will be written by the American people, not the NRA.\\nBernie Sanders: (07:36)\\nAnd the American people most certainly know that it is women who must control their own bodies, not politicians.\\nBernie Sanders: (07:51)\\nSo brothers and sisters, yes, together we will defeat Donald Trump, but we’re going to do more than that. Our message to Wall Street, and the insurance companies, and the drug companies, and the fossil fuel industry, and the military industrial complex, and the prison industrial complex, our message to them is change is coming.\\nBernie Sanders: (08:42)\\nTogether with the strongest grassroots movement this country has ever seen, where we have knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors here in Iowa. We’re doing it in New Hampshire. So let me conclude by thanking our great staff, our volunteers here in Iowa, and now it is on to New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, California, and onward to victory. Thank you all very much.\\nElizabeth Warren: (00:00)\\nIt is too close to call, so I’m just going to tell you what I do know.\\nSpeaker 2: (00:04)\\nYou won.\\nElizabeth Warren: (00:05)\\nAs the baby daughter of a janitor, I am so grateful to be up on this stage tonight. Tonight, as a party, we are one step closer to defeating the most corrupt president in American history. Tomorrow, Donald Trump will make a speech about the state of the union, but I have a message for every American, our union is stronger than Donald Trump. And in less than a year, our union will be stronger than ever when that one man is replaced by one very persistent woman.\\nAudience: (01:02)\\nWarren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren.\\nElizabeth Warren: (01:12)\\nNow, Donald Trump and I see America from very different viewpoints and we have since we were born. Trump grew up in New York City in a 23 room, nine bathroom mansion. I grew up out in Oklahoma in a two bedroom house with one bathroom and a converted garage where my three brothers slept. By the time he was three, Donald Trump was getting a $200,000 allowance every year from his dad’s real estate empire. In total, he got nearly half a billion dollars from his dad. Me, I took on small jobs to make money babysitting, waitressing, sewing dresses for my aunts. Donald Trump claimed bone spurs to avoid the draft. All three of my older brothers signed up for military service and the oldest spent five and a half years off and on in combat in Vietnam.\\nElizabeth Warren: (02:22)\\nBefore he became a reality TV host, Donald Trump spent most of his career running one company after another into bankruptcy. Stiffing small businesses, ripping off workers and scamming students. I spent most of my career studying why families go broke and fighting to make it easier for them to get back on their feet. Before I was even elected to office, I built an entire federal agency to stop big banks and financial institutions from cheating people. I tell you this …\\nElizabeth Warren: (03:12)\\nI love it. But I tell you this because a person’s values matter, a president’s values matter, and the only thing Donald Trump values is Donald Trump. He believes that government is just one more thing to exploit, a tool to enrich himself and his corrupt buddies at everyone else’s expense. I believe government should work for everyone. We don’t know all the results tonight, but tonight has already showed that Americans have a deep hunger for big structural change to make our economy and our democracy work for everyone. Tonight showed that our path to victory is to fight hard for the changes Americans are demanding, changes that Democrats, Independents, and Republicans are demanding. Tonight showed that our agenda isn’t just a progressive agenda. It isn’t just a democratic agenda. It’s an American agenda.\\nElizabeth Warren: (04:29)\\nThroughout our history, when moments of prices have called on us to meet big challenges, Americans have answered the call. Even when the doubters and critics say that our dreams are too big and the fights are too hard, we persist. In the 19 … In the 1700s, when people said we can never overthrow a King and form a new Republic, farmers and merchants came together and fought side by side until we won our independence. In the 1800s, people said that slavery would endure forever and African Americans would never see liberation. But abolitionists, enslaved and formerly enslaved people formed an underground railroad and more than 2 million people waged a war to defeat the tyranny of slavery.\\nElizabeth Warren: (05:32)\\nAnd in the 1900s, people said we could never rescue our economy from the depths of the Great Depression or defeat fascism, but we forged a new deal. We mobilized to defeat fascism. We expanded unions. We built a middle class and we marched for civil rights. Americans do big things. That’s who we are. We don’t settle. We don’t back down. We meet big problems with even bigger solution.\\nElizabeth Warren: (06:11)\\nSo I’m here tonight because I believe that big dreams are still possible in America. Tonight, you showed that when you imagine an America that lives up to its ideals, you can set in motion the process of making it a reality. All it takes is some hard work and better connections. And here in Iowa, that’s what happened. You came together, you organized, you showed that we are united in our conviction, that hope defeats fear, that courage overcomes cynicism. That we will always be a stronger party and a stronger nation. When we unite around our shared values to advance justice and expand opportunity to everyone. Right now, across America there are folks standing with groups of friends or sitting on the couch with loved ones, or maybe even watching this quietly on their phones, because everyone else in the house is asleep, watching and thinking, “Maybe I could help out.”\\nAudience: (07:38)\\nYeah.\\nElizabeth Warren: (07:39)\\nMaybe I could volunteer some time. Maybe I could get in the fight. And that is how we’re going to do this. I am here tonight to tell you if you have hope that America can be better than it has been in these last few years and if you have the courage to speak out and do a little organizing with us, then this campaign is for you. If you can imagine an America where corruption doesn’t block our ability to reduce gun violence, an America where we can urgently tackle climate change, an America where we can bring an end to the opioid epidemic, then this campaign is for you.\\nElizabeth Warren: (08:38)\\nIf you can imagine an economy where every job has dignity, where people are paid a livable wage, and where everyone, everyone has a real chance to thrive, then this campaign is for you. And if you could imagine a democracy where people, not money, come first, this campaign is for you. And if you can imagine an America of moral clarity that lives its values every day, then this campaign is for you. Tonight, we are one step closer to winning the fight for the America we imagined is possible. Tonight is for you. Tonight is for every volunteer who put their feet to the pavement to fight for change. It’s for every organizer who braved the blistering told to knock on doors.\\nElizabeth Warren: (10:00)\\nIt’s for every person who made a call or sent a text to spread the word. I’m going to tell you about some of our volunteers, because tonight is for the veteran who came back diagnosed with PTSD and who volunteered every week to help us become a nation that honors its promises to its veterans. Tonight is for every undocumented, unafraid organizer and volunteer who proudly knocked on doors to let the world know that the path to progress runs through courage, not fear. Tonight is for the innovative, persistent women who organized babysitting clubs so they could get in more hours of volunteering. And tonight is for the single mother who had been homeless and who was so determined that her twin daughters would grow up in a better world that she found the spare moments to make calls on our behalf. Tonight is for everyone who believes that no matter the color of your skin, who you love, how you worship, where you were born, or what zip code you live in, you should be safe and your opportunities should be pretty much as good as everyone else’s.\\nElizabeth Warren: (11:41)\\nIn every day and every way, this movement is made up of people who know that the only way to make progress and to build power is to fight from the heart. So tonight, Iowa, and all of you, I want to say thank you. Thank you for living your values, thank you for standing together, fighting together, persisting together. You have made me a better candidate and you will make me a better president. And while I’m at it, I want to thank my sweetie Bruce. I [crosstalk 00:12:36] … And thanks to Bailey. He truly is a good boy.\\nElizabeth Warren: (12:59)\\nTogether, we have built a movement powered by hopeful, courageous people who will do the work to make the change we need. And we’re just getting started. This race will be decided by people like you and if you believe that something should be done, then I’m asking you to do something. Go to elizabethwarren.com right now, pitch in a few bucks, sign up to volunteer, get involved with our campaign near wherever you live, because this race started right here in Iowa, but from tomorrow it will run from ocean to ocean, East to New Hampshire and then West to Nevada and then down to South Carolina. This fight will stretch across all 57 States and territories that make up this great nation until we unite together as a party in Milwaukee.\\nElizabeth Warren: (13:58)\\nThe road won’t be easy …\\nAudience: (14:19)\\nWarren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren, Warren.\\nElizabeth Warren: (14:20)\\nThe road is not going to be easy here, but we are built for the long haul. Yeah, we still have a fight on our hands, but we are fueled by the hope in our hearts. Our optimism and our determination run deep. And no matter what lies ahead, we are not afraid. This is our moment. This is the moment we have been called to. Our moment to make history, our moment to dream big, fight hard, and win.\\nJoe Biden: (00:05)\\nHello, everyone.\\nAudience: (00:05)\\nWe want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe!\\nJoe Biden: (00:17)\\nFolks, well, it looks like it’s going to be a long night, but I’m feeling good. I want to thank you all, all our supporters and all those incredible people who hold public office in this state that endorsed us and all the endorsers from all across the country, my colleagues in the Senate and the house and from the vice presidency, all of you, and all the people from Delaware, California, all the people came from all over to campaign here.\\nJoe Biden: (00:43)\\nI want to tell you. And most of all, I want to thank the Iowans that are here. Well, the Iowa Democratic Party is working to get this result, get them straight, and I want to make sure they’re very careful with their deliberations. And indications are… From our indications, it’s going to be close. We’re going to walk out of here with our shared delegates. We don’t know exactly what it is yet, but we feel good about where we are. And look. So, it’s on in New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and well beyond. We’re in this for the long haul.\\nJoe Biden: (01:27)\\nAnd I want us to remember not just tonight but throughout this campaign, this isn’t-\\nAudience: (01:34)\\nWe love you, Joe.\\nJoe Biden: (01:35)\\nThis… Thank you. This isn’t just another election. This is well beyond just our party. This is about a ending an era of… well, ending an era, God willing, of a present who… Look. This is bigger than any of us. It really is. We cannot allow Donald Trump to be reelected to the United States presidency again. I’m ready to give him a new nickname, the former President Trump. Chris, the former President Trump.\\nJoe Biden: (02:18)\\nAnd folks, as I said, it’s bigger than any candidate, bigger than any party. And folks, I said from the outset. Jill and I both said. We’re in the battle for the soul of the nation, and that’s not hyperbole. We really believe that, and I think it has been demonstrated every single hour he remains as president of the United States. Folks, each and every one knows that deep in our bones that everything this day she stands for is at stake. And I really mean it. Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation, and character is on the ballot. That’s what this is. Everything that makes America America is at stake, and literally our democracy is at stake in my view, our view. I say our view because you’ve been doing as hard work as I have.\\nJoe Biden: (03:12)\\nFolks, I love her too, man. Well, I’ll tell you what. And the other reason we’re running and we’re going to make sure it happens is we’ve got to rebuild the backbone of this country, the working class, the middle class. They’ve been getting laid out badly by this administration. The middle class is being hurt very badly. But look, you know what? We have to unify this country as well. Everybody understands that CEOs and Wall Street bankers didn’t build America. Ordinary hardworking people led by unions built America. Unions.\\nJoe Biden: (03:50)\\nAnd folks, we needed a president is not only ready to fight but is also ready to heal this country. We can’t hold grudges. We’ve got to be able to go out and unify the country because the president is supposed to heal as well as fight. And that’s exactly what I plan on doing. We plan on doing. All of us in this hall plan on doing. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m going to go all over this country, every part of the democratic party and reunite it, men, women, gay, straight, everyone, Black, Brown, a whole universe of people out there.\\nJoe Biden: (04:25)\\nBecause folks, there’s nothing, nothing we’ve ever failed at when we’ve tried to do it together. Nothing America has ever, ever failed at. And so, ladies and gentlemen, all my friends… And by the way, I want to say a special thanks again to Harold Schaitberger and the firefighters. You’ve been incredible to us. You’ve been incredible to us.\\nJoe Biden: (04:52)\\nBut folks, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Well, it’s fortunate they do know now. They didn’t know last time, I don’t think, but they know now. And folks, we got to let them know who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose science over fiction, unity over deviation, and compassion over cruelty. And maybe most importantly of all, truth over lies.\\nJoe Biden: (05:27)\\nFolks, we’re going to do this. I promise you. I promise you we’re going to get this done. And God willing, God willing, we’ll do it together. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. On in New Hampshire.\\nAudience: (00:00)\\n(silence)\\nAudience: (00:00)\\nButtigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg.\\nPete Buttigieg: (01:32)\\nThank you. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What a night. Because tonight, an improbable hope became an undeniable reality.\\nAudience: (01:40)\\nButtigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg.\\nPete Buttigieg: (01:43)\\nWe don’t know all the results, but we know by the time it’s all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation. Because by all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.\\nAudience: (02:38)\\nPete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete.\\nPete Buttigieg: (02:38)\\nOne year ago, it was in the deep freeze of an Iowa January where we began this unlikely journey to win the American presidency. We weren’t well-known, but we had a new idea. The idea that at this moment when Washington has never felt further from our everyday lives, a middle-class mayor from the American Midwest could carry the voices of the American people all the way to the American capital and make sure they’re actually heard.\\nPete Buttigieg: (03:48)\\nWe had the belief that in the face of exhaustion and cynicism and division, in spite of every trampled norm and every poisonous tweak, that a rising majority of Americans was hungry for action and ready for new answers. We could see an American majority yearning for leadership to rally us together behind bold ideas to make a difference in our lives. We saw that Americans were ready to come together, but our politics were not.\\nPete Buttigieg: (04:29)\\nTo seize this moment, we needed a new path forward, a path that welcomed people instead of pushing them away. Brought them together instead of driving them apart, because this is our best and maybe our last shot.\\nPete Buttigieg: (04:50)\\nWe knew that with this American majority, we are on the cusp of changing the game for ordinary Americans. But that we could not win or govern if we wrote people off who didn’t agree with us 100% of the time. But then if we could come together, the future that we know is possible would start on January 21st, 2021.\\nAudience: (05:13)\\nPresident Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete. President Pete.\\nPete Buttigieg: (05:14)\\nThere were skeptics, an awful lot of skeptics who said, “Not now. Not this time. All this talk of belonging and of bridging divides is too naive, too risky.” So tonight I say with a heart full of gratitude, Iowa, you have proved those skeptics wrong.\\nAudience: (06:00)\\nI-O-W-A, Mayor Pete all the way. I-O-W-A, Mayor Pete all the way. I-O-W-A, Mayor Pete all the way. I-O-W-A, Mayor Pete all the way.\\nPete Buttigieg: (06:25)\\nBy your effort, and it was by your effort we brought together an extraordinary coalition of Americans. Progressives, moderates, and that good number of what we like to call future former Republicans. That’s how we’re going to win in November, because it’s about adding people to our cause, adding to our majority. That is how we will guarantee that on the day Donald Trump leaves office, we will be ready to move America forward into the era that must come next.\\nPete Buttigieg: (07:14)\\nI want to thank every member of our campaign family, every organizer, every volunteer, every caucus-goer who talked to a neighbor or a coworker, every staff member and every supporter who believed. Anyone who shares our vision can join the three-quarters of a million grassroots supporters fueling our movement and chip in right now at PeteforAmerica.com.\\nAudience: (07:38)\\nButtigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg.\\nPete Buttigieg: (07:43)\\nWhile we’re at it, I want to recognize a few other people who helped us get to this night. My mother, who not only helped raise me, but put her love of language to work, answering letters sent to our campaign.\\nAudience: (08:08)\\n[inaudible 00:08:26].\\nPete Buttigieg: (08:36)\\nMy father who left us just in the very early days of this journey, but whose own journey to this country made tonight possible in the first place. And to the love of my life, keeping my feet on the ground. How about a hand for the future First Gentleman of the United States. Let’s hear it for Chasten.\\nAudience: (09:00)\\nChasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten. Chasten.\\nPete Buttigieg: (09:19)\\nI also want to congratulate my fellow democratic competitors in this diverse and formidable field. For months we have been having an honest and respectful but vigorous debate about the course of our party and the future of this nation. Tonight, Iowa chose a new path.\\nPete Buttigieg: (10:02)\\nFrom river to river, and churches and community centers and high school gyms, you joined your neighbors to say that the time has come to turn the page and open up a new chapter in the American story. You chose to move on, not just from the broken policies of these last few years, but the broken politics that got us here.\\nPete Buttigieg: (10:28)\\nTomorrow, because of what we did here, the nation will have that choice too. We take our message onward to New Hampshire, which has a way of making up its own mind, to Nevada, to South Carolina, and beyond to every corner of America. As we do, we will be building the movement that not only will win the election against Donald Trump, but win the era for our shared values.\\nPete Buttigieg: (11:06)\\nWe have exactly one shot to defeat Donald Trump. We’re not going to do it by overreaching. We’re not going to do it by division. We’re not going to do it by saying, “It’s my way or the highway.”\\nAudience: (11:20)\\nRight.\\nPete Buttigieg: (11:20)\\nThis is our shot. Our only shot to galvanize an American majority to win. Make no mistake. Ours is the campaign that will defeat this president.\\nAudience: (11:34)\\nButtigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg.\\nPete Buttigieg: (11:54)\\nA president who cuts taxes for corporations while crushing the rights of workers to organize, ought to have to compete with a middle-class mayor who entered politics, fighting for auto workers, and actually lives and works in the industrial Midwest. A president who tries to cloak himself in his wrongdoing and religion should have to debate a candidate not afraid to remind America that God does not belong to a political party. And a president who avoided serving when it was his turn should have to stand next to a veteran, ready to show what troops deserve from a real commander in chief.\\nPete Buttigieg: (12:47)\\nNow, this president may get a pass on the floor of the Senate, but this November, the verdict will be up to us. When I am your nominee, we will win big enough to send not just Donald Trump’s presidency, but Trumpism itself into the dustbin of history where it belongs.\\nPete Buttigieg: (13:29)\\nSomething is stirring in America right now. You can feel it. We saw tonight in the bluest counties, in the reddest, in rural towns and industrial cities, in big communities, in small, and the suburbs in between. We’re seeing Democrats hungry to win. Independent voters who had been turned off by our politics. Republicans tired of trying to look their kids in the eye and explain this presidency. All standing together and all standing together to declare that we are defined not by who we voted for in the past, but by what we’re voting for in the future.\\nPete Buttigieg: (14:21)\\nThis is the coalition that no pundit saw coming. It’s the coalition the president won’t see coming either. It’s a majority we’re assembling to agree not just on who we’re against, but on what we are for. We are unifying a rising American majority ready to raise wages and empower workers in this fast-changing economy. A majority ready and determined to put an end to endless war. A majority committed to bringing about a day in America where your race has no bearing on your health, your wealth, your access to education, or your relationship with law enforcement. A majority of Americans ready to support our teachers with a president and a secretary of education who believe in public education.\\nPete Buttigieg: (15:34)\\nThose Americans are counting on us to come together and act, and they cannot wait. I’ve met Americans not even yet old enough to vote, but who know that we cannot wait. An 11-year-old asking how his family will be able to afford the insulin he needs. He can’t wait for a president who will ensure there is no such thing as an uninsured American or an unaffordable prescription. The 14-year-old who let me know she’s already written out a basic will because she’s terrified the next day in school could be her last. Cannot wait for a president who will see to it that she can walk into her school free of fear. The 10-year-old who let me know he expects to be around in 2100 and look back at whether we acted fast enough to secure his future. He cannot wait for a president prepared to enlist every American in the fight for our climate.\\nPete Buttigieg: (16:55)\\nWe are running for them. This campaign is giving voice to them. It has room for everyone because no matter who you voted for in elections past. For that matter, no matter who you caucused for tonight, we welcome you in our campaign and you belong in the future that we are building for America.\\nAudience: (17:15)\\nButtigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg. Buttigieg.\\nPete Buttigieg: (17:37)\\nWhether you’re a young woman with autism in Muscatine or a veteran battling addiction in Clermont, you belong. Whether you clean hotel rooms in Las Vegas or are getting a new business up and running in Charleston, you belong.\\nPete Buttigieg: (17:56)\\nI believe the presidency has a purpose. The purpose of our American presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification and the empowerment to the American people to solve these big problems.\\nPete Buttigieg: (18:17)\\nAmerica has a place for everyone. I believe this not because of my age, but because of my experience. I believe in American unity because of my experience serving. Of lacing up my boots in the dust of a war zone alongside Americans so different we hardly had anything in common besides the flag on our shoulders, yet learned to trust each other with our lives.\\nAudience: (18:42)\\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\\nPete Buttigieg: (18:48)\\nI believe in American boldness because of my experience governing, guiding a city once called dying, out of the shadows of our empty factories and into a brighter future.\\nPete Buttigieg: (19:06)\\nI believe in American belonging because of an experience you are part of right here tonight. Looking out at you and remembering how it felt to be an Indiana teenager, wondering if he would ever belong in this world. Wondering if something deep inside him meant that he would forever be an outsider. That he might never wear the uniform, never be accepted, never even know love. Now that same person is standing in front of you, a mayor, a veteran, happily married, and one step closer to becoming the next president of the United States.\\nAudience: (19:42)\\n[inaudible 00:19:58].\\nPete Buttigieg: (19:56)\\nThat is the America we are building. That is the America so many Iowans chose tonight. If you are ready to build an American life defined by belonging, this is our chance. If you’re ready to build an American politics defined by boldness, this is our chance. If you are ready to build an American future defined by unity in the face of our greatest challenges, this is our chance.\\nPete Buttigieg: (20:39)\\nWith hope in our hearts and fire in our bellies, we’re going on to New Hampshire, on to the nomination, and on to chart a new course for this country that we love. Thank you. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you so much. Thank you.\\nAmy Klobuchar: (00:02)\\nThank you so much. Unbelievable. You probably heard we don’t know the results, but I did not want to let another minute go by without thanking all of you. We know there’s delays, but we know one thing: We are punching above our weight. My heart is full tonight. One, because I have my great chair here. Thank you, Andy McGuire. Two, because I have this fantastic staff with that has stood with us all the time. And three, because my husband and daughter are here with me tonight. And I want to thank them. I want to thank our tireless field organizers, the unstoppable volunteers who would never give up and we are feeling so good tonight, and I cannot wait somehow some way, I’m going to get on a plane tonight to New Hampshire and we are bringing this ticket to New Hampshire.\\nAmy Klobuchar: (01:15)\\nEven in a crowded field of candidates, even during the well-earned impeachment hearing of Donald J. Trump, which kept me bolted to my Senate desk for the last two weeks, we kept fighting and you kept fighting for me. We have started in a blizzard and a lot of people didn’t predict I’d finish that speech. That’s what they’re … “Like how could she do it?” Then in the summer they kept saying, “Is she going to make it through the summer?” And then debate after debate after debate and all I can say is we are here and we are strong.\\nAmy Klobuchar: (02:01)\\nAnd with that same grit that got us through that blizzard, we are now ready to head to New Hampshire. And my friends here in Iowa, you know we have beaten the odds every step of the way. We have done it on the merits, we have done it with ideas and we have done it with hard work because.\\nSpeaker 2: (02:21)\\n[inaudible 00:02:22], Amy.\\nAmy Klobuchar: (02:21)\\nThank you. We know in our hearts that in a democracy it is not about the loudest voice or the biggest bank account. It is about the best idea and it is about the person that can turn those ideas into action. We know that our party can’t win big by trying to out divide the divider in chief. We know that we win by bringing people with us instead of shutting them out. Donald Trump’s worst nightmare is that the people in the middle, the people who have had enough of the name calling and the mudslinging, have a candidate to vote for in November. Donald Trump’s worst nightmare is that our fired up Democrats will march to victory alongside a big coalition of independence and moderate Republicans that see this election just as we do. That this election is yes, an economic check, but it also is a patriotic check. It is a decency check. It is the simple idea. It’s a simple idea that the heart of America is so much bigger than the heart of this guy in the White House.\\nAmy Klobuchar: (03:52)\\nOur country cannot take another four years of Donald Trump. Our collective sense of decency can’t take another four years. The rule of law can’t withstand another four years of a president that thinks he’s above it. Our democracy cannot tolerate another four years of a president who wants to bulldoze right through it. The American dream cannot take another four years of a president who thinks he can choose who gets it. His playbook is not hard to understand. It is really three words. Divide and demoralize. Well, I have a playbook that’s three words, unite and lead.\\nAmy Klobuchar: (04:44)\\nThat is how I have passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in the United States Senate in the middle of that gridlock. And that is how I have won elections in the reddest of red congressional districts in the bluest of blue congressional districts. The president though, he might as well have a sign on his desk that says the buck stops anywhere but here. Look at what he has done. He blames everyone for our problems. He blames everyone. People that shouldn’t be blamed. Who does he blame? He blames immigrants, right? He blames Barack Obama. He blames the Fed Chair that he nominated, the energy secretary that he appointed, the generals that he commands. And yes, the King of Denmark. He even recently blamed Justin Trudeau for cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2. Who does that? Who does that?\\nAmy Klobuchar: (05:50)\\nLet me tell you what I will do. When I am behind that desk, I will take responsibility instead of passing it on. I will reach across the aisle and work with Americans in good faith. Instead of picking fights, I’ll bring this country together instead of pushing it apart. Some of you may know that old story about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and it was a story about how after he died, they put his body on a train and it worked its way to Washington, DC. And there’s a story of a reporter who came upon a man who was crying by the side of those tracks and the man had his hat on his chest and he was sobbing and the reporter looked at him and said, “Sir, do you know President Roosevelt? Did you know him?” And the man says, “No, I didn’t know president Roosevelt, but he knew me. He knew me.”\\nAmy Klobuchar: (06:49)\\nAnd what we are missing so much right now in our country is that sense of empathy. We are missing that caring and I promise you this, I will bring back that sacred trust between the American people and the President of the United States. If you are sick and tired of hearing how great the economy is when you don’t feel it, when your paycheck is stretched to the breaking point month after month, I know you, and I will fight for you. If you are sick of choosing between paying for daycare for your kids and longterm care for your parents, I know you, and I will fight for you. If you’re sick of being torn between filling a refrigerator and filling a prescription, I know you, and I will fight for you. And if you want a democratic nominee who can make our tent bigger and our coalition wider and our coattails longer-\\nSpeaker 3: (08:00)\\nAmy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy!\\nAmy Klobuchar: (08:19)\\nIf you want that, I know you, and I will fight for you. And if you are sick and tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. Please join our campaign at amyklobuchar.com. Join us. Join us because we are going to be here it looks like a really long time tonight, and you will have plenty of time to join us at amyklobuchar.com. Let’s stay up. Let’s stay in a good spirit because you all know what happened out there in those precincts. You know that we have been punching way beyond our weight. You know that despite some limited resources compared to some of those bigger bank accounts, we are way on the board. Let’s stay up. Let’s stay happy and let’s head to New Hampshire. Thank you, Iowa. I love you.\\nSpeaker 3: (09:27)\\nAmy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy!\\nAndrew Yang: (00:26)\\nHello. Hello. Good morning. Hello Iowa. Thank you so much. You all are incredible.\\nAndrew Yang: (00:34)\\nI also want to say a special thank you to my wife Evelyn Yang for being such an incredible partner along this journey. I love you so much, baby. Woo. What a night here in Iowa. Thank you all so much for the hard work and dedication you put into making tonight a tremendous night for the yang gang in this campaign. And this is a great time to actually pause for reflection on how far we’ve come. We declared over two years ago. Over 30 people ended up jumping into the race. I remember that first debate stage. There were 20 candidates. They had to break it up into two nights. And I’m going right from here to New Hampshire where I will be one of the seven candidates on the debate stage.\\nAndrew Yang: (01:28)\\nI brought it out in New Hampshire. So many of you dropped everything and came here to Iowa to fight for this campaign. Raise your hand if you’re here from out of state and came here. Let’s give them a round of applause. Let’s give you a round of applause. Look at this. That’s humanity first. That is what has made this campaign the political force of nature that no one saw coming. We’ve raised tens of millions of dollars from almost half a million Americans in increments of only $30 each. And that is because people have made this case to other people at every step of the way. And tonight what happened? We saw that tens of thousands of Iowans around the state realized that the economy is transforming around them in profound ways. I’ve seen it myself. It’s gone from the farms to the factories to the main streets, and eventually we’ll hit the highways. This is what we have to turn around yang gang. We have to actually make an economy that works for us instead of the bottom lines of these huge companies.\\nAndrew Yang: (02:53)\\nTo say it is all about our bottom line because we all hear their record high corporate profits, record GDP in this country. You know what else are at record highs in the United States of America right now? Stress, anxiety, drug overdoses, suicides, depression, student loan debt, medical bankruptcies. If your corporate profits are going up and your very life expectancy is going down, which do you listen to?\\nCrowd: (03:24)\\nLife expectancy.\\nAndrew Yang: (03:26)\\nThat’s right. It’s our lives, yang gang. It’s our lives America. We have to start measuring how we’re doing by how we are doing and not how these giant companies are doing. Because the two are no longer lining up. If anything, they’re heading in opposite directions more and more. And that is what this campaign can change. This campaign can make our country’s bottom line, our family’s bottom line, our kids’ bottom line, our town’s bottom line. Because you look around and you see that our current economy does not reward the kind of work that Evelyn and stay at home parents do every single day.\\nAndrew Yang: (04:07)\\nIt doesn’t recognize and reward the kind of work that caregivers like Kyle Christensen, taking care of their ailing mom, do every single day. Volunteers and activists doing work in your communities, artists, people trying to make the community stronger. All of these are getting zeroed out one by one by one. Our very democracy is getting zeroed out because in this country today, we feel money on one side and people on the other. It’s the money that wins. And this campaign is about turning that around. This campaign is about saying the best way we can solve our own problems is by putting economic resources into our hands, the people’s hands, that we know how to improve our lives better than any other government program. That message rang loud and clear here in Iowa tonight thanks to each and every one of you. And now we’re going to take that message to New Hampshire and the rest of the country.\\nAndrew Yang: (05:14)\\nI got to say, I’m a numbers guy. We’re still waiting on numbers from tonight. We’re all looking around and being like, what’s the math? What’s the math? And this is one of those situations where we can essentially just throw some algebra letters up on the wall and being like, I guess we’ll project onto these new letters for now what the numbers are going to be. But the math that I care most about is the fact that this movement has become something that has already shocked the political world, and it’s going to keep on going from here. It’s going to keep on growing from here.\\nAndrew Yang: (05:56)\\nYou know what’s fun is when some of the other campaigns hold a fundraiser, they get together in a fancy place. They put on their nice duds. They come together. They say expensive words. They think expensive thoughts. You know the way the yang gang has a fundraiser? We’re going to have a fundraiser right now. What we’re saying is yang gang, if you want to keep this movement growing through New Hampshire, chip in five, 10, 20, 30 bucks tonight, and let’s show that this campaign is going to grow and grow all the way to the White House. We have shocked the world time and time again yang gang. Are we done yet?\\nCrowd: (06:38)\\nNo.\\nAndrew Yang: (06:40)\\nNo. We’re going to go to New Hampshire. I’m going to be in the CNN town hall, the debate stage on Friday. The vote is going to start on the 11th. And then they’re going to see that this campaign has just begun and it is going to go all the way. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you yang gang. Love you all. I love each and every one of you the best. You’re beautiful human beings, and we’re going to keep on going all the way to the White House, and then we’re going to have a big celebration at the end, a year from now the White House lawn. Thank you, yang gang.



Now as everyone knows, the Iowa process is enormously complicated. In my view, it is far too complicated.\\nBernie Sanders: (00:22)\\nAnd one word, if I might, about the so-called state delegate equivalence, SDEs, that the cable news and political pundants have spent so much time pontificating about. Because of changes to Democratic party rules that will widely supported during the Democratic Unity Reform Commission. These state delegate equivalents have greatly diminished importance from past caucuses and they should. In the past, a candidate with more delegates at the state and county conventions could actually change the number of national delegates, delegates who go to the national convention, from that allocated on caucus night. That is no longer the case.\\nBernie Sanders: (01:13)\\nAs it stands right now, to the best of my knowledge, either I or Mr. Buttigieg will end with a tiny fraction of an advantage in the SDEs. I think he’s ahead now by some 3.5 state delegates out of 2,150 total number of delegates. That may change. We may go in the lead by a little bit. Given the remaining precincts outstanding and mathematical errors, which we are discovering in the data, we could well end up with more SDEs. But this difference no matter who inches ahead in the end is meaningless, because we are both likely to receive the same number of national delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. I think right now it is about 11 each probably go up a bit. Those national delegates, not the state delegates, are the ones that really matter in the nominating process.\\nBernie Sanders: (02:17)\\nAnd now that Iowa is hopefully, finally behind us, let me take this opportunity to thank the thousands of volunteers here in New Hampshire who are out today on the streets in rain and snow, knocking on doors, making the phone calls that have to be made, using social media in order to help us win here in Iowa.\\nBernie Sanders: (02:42)\\nLast point that I want to make is I have been asked over and over again why I believe that we are the campaign to defeat Donald Trump and let me tell you why that is the case. At the end of the day, in order to defeat Donald Trump, who will be a very formidable opponent, we are going to need an unprecedented grassroots movement of folks who are prepared to knock on doors and do all of the things that our support did in Iowa and they’re doing right here in New Hampshire and they’re doing right now in California and in Nevada and South Carolina and all across this country.\\nBernie Sanders: (03:22)\\nOur campaign is I believe the campaign that is putting together a multi-generational, multi-racial process in which we are bringing people together around an agenda that is speaking to the working families of this country. We’re not out raising huge sums of money from millionaires and billionaires. We have an agenda that is going to take on the millionaires and the billionaires. We have an agenda which is going to deal with income and wealth inequality. We have an agenda which is going to raise wages for the working families of this country, an agenda, which says finally, after 100 years of talk, now is the time to do what every other major country on earth is doing, and that is to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human rights.\\nBernie Sanders: (04:17)\\nSo I think we have the grassroots movement that wins. We have the agenda that wins. I’m confident that we’re going to do really well here in New Hampshire, having won Iowa. We’re going to do very well in Nevada. I think we’re going to do a lot better than people think in South Carolina. I think we’ve got a good shot to win California. And bottom line, I believe that we are well positioned to win the Democratic nomination and to defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. I thank you all very much.\\nSpeaker 2: (04:47)\\nSenator Sanders. Senator Sanders.\\nBernie Sanders: (04:50)\\nCBS. We’ll start with CBS. Then we’ll go on.\\nSpeaker 3: (04:58)\\nSenator Tom Perez is calling for essentially a recount in this process. Is that something that you would support and do you trust that the people running the party in Iowa are effective in doing their job?\\nBernie Sanders: (05:10)\\nAll I can say is what I just said, is we won an eight person election by some 6,000 votes. That is not going to be changed. What may be changed in this so-called recount is a few SDEs here, but at the end of the day, as I’ve just indicated, these SDEs are not of what… what these SDEs will do is go to a convention in Iowa. They will determine who the Iowa chairman is. They will determine the rules of the Iowa Democratic Party. Very important, I guess, for Iowa Democrats, but not important for the rest of the country. At the end of the day, what will… I expect almost definitely happen is that Mr. Buttigieg And I will end up with the same amount of delegates, 11 now each probably a little bit more. That’s what will happen. Ain’t going to change. And what certainly is not going to change is the fact that in terms of the popular vote, we won a decisive victory.\\nSpeaker 3: (06:04)\\nSo you-\\nBernie Sanders: (06:04)\\nGary. Hold… I’m sorry. Yeah. Gary.\\nGary: (06:07)\\nSenator, there’s been a lot of accounting issues and a lot of issues with the Iowa Democratic Party. How should people respond to this? Should they trust the Iowa Democratic Party here?\\nBernie Sanders: (06:14)\\nI think what you should trust are two things. Number one, and I really do feel bad for the people of Iowa, because I’ve been all over the state, as you well know. We have held, I think, 120 rallies and town meetings, and these are serious people who are trying to do the best they can in determining who the best candidate for president is. And I think what has happened with the Iowa Democratic Party is an outrage, that they were that unprepared, that they put forth such a complicated process, relied on untested technology and also to be honest with you, they have relied on thousands of volunteers, good people who have to get up and go to work the next day, all right, to do what is enormously complicated and I think there is very little doubt that what happened on Monday night, that type of process, that complicated process that is never, ever, I don’t think going to happen again. Yeah.\\nSpeaker 2: (07:16)\\nSenator.\\nSpeaker 3: (07:16)\\nSenator.\\nSpeaker 5: (07:17)\\nSenator Sanders, Mayor Pete’s been declaring a win for days now. Why should people believe your victory speech over his?\\nBernie Sanders: (07:26)\\nBecause I got 6,000 more votes and from where I come when you get 6,000 more votes, that’s generally regarded to be the winner.\\nSpeaker 2: (07:33)\\nSenator.\\nSpeaker 3: (07:33)\\nSenator.\\nBernie Sanders: (07:33)\\nYes.\\nSpeaker 6: (07:37)\\nSenator, a huge part of the recount is from the satellite caucuses, which you are doing very well in. Are you worried about why this recount was called, specifically with those votes in mind?\\nBernie Sanders: (07:49)\\nNo, I don’t think it’s going to be… I just learned about this a few minutes ago, but I think if they’re going to do this recount, that’ll be for every precinct in the state. And look, in terms of the satellite caucuses, the purpose of the satellite caucuses, which is a good purpose… one of the problems that you have with a caucus that takes place at 7:00 in an evening. Well, what happens is if you’re a working person, what happens if you’re a mom who has two kids and you can’t come out to a caucus. And what I think the Iowa Democratic Party tried to do correctly is to say, “Okay, if you can’t come out, if you’re a student in a night class, we will provide you an opportunity to vote.” And most of the people I think who voted are working class people. And you’re right, we did very, very well in those satellite caucuses and I’m proud of that victory there. Okay. Yep.\\nSpeaker 7: (08:37)\\nHow are you. Joe Biden said yesterday that Donald Trump is desperate to pin the socialists label on our party. Why are you so certain that your own self identification as a democratic socialist won’t have serious blow back in November?\\nBernie Sanders: (08:49)\\nLet me tell my good friend, Joe, that when we’re dealing with somebody like Donald Trump, who lies all of the time, he will pin any label that he wants on any candidate. It doesn’t really matter. But I think the agenda that we have is the agenda that speaks to the working families of this country.\\nBernie Sanders: (09:11)\\nLet me tell you something else. We will expose Trump, not only for the liar, pathological liar that he is, but for the fraud, that is total fraud. And this is a man, as all of you know, who spends half his life demonizing the undocumented in this country. Oh, he just hates the undocumented, how terrible it is. And yet, as a private businessman, he hired quite knowledgeably, hundreds and hundreds of undocumented workers in his resorts and in construction projects so he could save money. This is the guy who says, “Oh, I hate outsourcing. We got to make sure that corporations create jobs here in the United States, not go to cheap labor countries abroad.” This is a businessman who manufactured his products in low wage countries abroad, in Turkey, in China, and in other low wage countries. He is a fraud. He is a liar. And we will expose him for what he is.\\nBernie Sanders: (10:13)\\nThis is a man who during his campaign, he said, “My tax plan, it’s going to not benefit the wealthy, it’s going to benefit working families.” 83% of the benefits of his tax plan have gone to the top 1% over a 10 year period, and we end up with the absurdity of companies like Amazon, which made $10 billion in profit last year, last year. They’re not paying a nickel in federal income taxes. So we will have an opportunity during this campaign to expose Trump, not only as a liar, but as a fraud. Yes, ma’am\\nSpeaker 8: (10:47)\\nSenator. Thank you, Senator Sanders. So Michael Bloomberg is skipping early states. There’ll be a debate tomorrow night. He won’t be on the stage. Do you think it’s fair that the Democratic Party altered or revised the rules to put him-\\nBernie Sanders: (11:02)\\nI absolute-\\nSpeaker 8: (11:02)\\n… wait, wait. Let me at least put the question all the way out-\\nBernie Sanders: (11:04)\\nJust give me the answer right?\\nSpeaker 8: (11:05)\\n… even though you know where I’m going.\\nBernie Sanders: (11:06)\\nWe want to answer the question.\\nSpeaker 8: (11:07)\\nYou know where I’m going. Do you think it’s fair that the rules are now allowing Michael Bloomberg to come in and I’m looking at you as I see your slogan there, Bernie, not the billionaire. So could you comment also on the rules-\\nBernie Sanders: (11:22)\\nIt’s billionaires. Do we have an S at the end.\\nSpeaker 8: (11:23)\\nYou have an S.\\nBernie Sanders: (11:23)\\nAll right.\\nSpeaker 8: (11:24)\\nSo could you comment not only on the debate, but on the even more money that Bloomberg is putting in the contest?\\nBernie Sanders: (11:30)\\nLook-\\nSpeaker 8: (11:30)\\nThank you.\\nBernie Sanders: (11:32)\\nYes. Thank you for the question. And I knew what the question is. I was going to answer it the same way.\\nSpeaker 8: (11:34)\\nWell you got to make sure though.\\nBernie Sanders: (11:35)\\nOkay. No, I think it is an outrage. Look, rules are rules and people like Julian Castro played by the rules, campaigned really hard. Cory Booker played by the rules. Tulsi Gabbard played by the rules. Andrew Yang played by the rules. They were here in New Hampshire. They were in Iowa. They have work really, really hard, and for… based on the rules determined by the DNC, they were unable to participate in one or more debates.\\nBernie Sanders: (12:10)\\nAnd now suddenly a guy comes in who does not campaign one bit in Iowa, New Hampshire. He’s not on the ballot, I guess, in Nevada or South Carolina, but he’s worth $55 billion and I guess if you’re worth $55 billion, you can get the rules changed for a debate. So to answer your question, I think that that is an absolute outrage and really unfair. And I say this because these other guys on my friends, the people like Cory Booker or Julian Castro or Tulsi Gabbard who work really, really hard, they were excluded, but they’re not multi-billionaires. That’s wrong.\\nSpeaker 2: (12:47)\\nSenator.\\nSpeaker 9: (12:47)\\nSenator do you have confidence in-\\nBernie Sanders: (12:48)\\nYeah.\\nSpeaker 10: (12:50)\\nTwo questions.\\nBernie Sanders: (12:50)\\nWe’ll see how the first one goes.\\nSpeaker 10: (12:56)\\nA lot of Democrats are going to hear what you’re saying this morning, members who are actually, or people who actually are members of the Democratic Party and will say, “Why not wait? Why not let Iowa finish counting first before declaring victory?” Aren’t you confusing the process by doing so?\\nBernie Sanders: (13:08)\\nWell, I would hope given the fact that we have waited three days and now there is a talk of another recount, maybe we might want the decisions of the Iowa caucus before the November election, but I think what is very clear, two points, it is what is not going to change is that we won a very significant victory in the popular vote. We won a very significant victory in the realignment vote. And if you go out on the streets to New Hampshire, you go to Vermont and you ask people, “How do you determine who wins an election?” Well, from where I come from and where everybody else comes from, the person who gets the most votes wins. We got the most votes.\\nBernie Sanders: (13:50)\\nAnd as I said before, and I got to say this to my friends in the media, is you guys have been putting too much emphasis on these SDEs. There’s a confusion that SDEs will determine the number on national delegates. National delegates are important. SDEs do not determine they determine who the party chair is, the rules of the Iowa Democratic Party.\\nBernie Sanders: (14:16)\\nSo as I said earlier, I think in terms of the basic question are coming out of Iowa, how many delegates do we have? How many delegates does Elizabeth have? How many delegates does Buttigieg? That is not determined by these SDEs. So I think it is fair to say that we won the caucus.\\nSpeaker 10: (14:33)\\nAnd was there something specific you’d… you talk about a multi-racial grassroots movement in Iowa. Was there something specific you did an Iowa, either targeting certain community or certain part of the state that you anticipate doing again down the road-\\nBernie Sanders: (14:48)\\nSure.\\nSpeaker 10: (14:48)\\n… in any other states?\\nBernie Sanders: (14:50)\\nLook at the whole thrust of what our campaign is about is to understand that in America we have one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth. That’s what we do. And the reason for that are many fold. One of them is that a whole lot of working class people here in New Hampshire, Vermont, all over this country, they’re working two or three jobs. They can’t afford childcare. They spend that half of their income in housing. They can’t afford to send their kids to college and they are saying, “Who is concerned about me? I turn on the TV on a year old is blah blah. Is anybody worrying about me and I’m going to retire at 65 and I don’t have anything in the bank for retirement. Anyone worried about me or is it just the billionaires and the wealthy who determine what goes on in Washington?” A lot of those people say it’s all nonsense. We’re not going to vote. What do I want to waste my vote? The whole system is so corrupt.\\nBernie Sanders: (15:46)\\nAnd the essence of our campaign is to talk to those people, to knock on those doors, the doors of black voters and white voters and Latino voters and Asian American and Latino and Native American voters and to say, “You know what? If we all stand together, yeah, we can take on the billionaire class, which now dominates what goes on in Washington, both politically and from an economic perspective. Yeah, we can create an economy and a government that works for all of us.” Okay. Yes ma’am.\\nSpeaker 11: (16:23)\\nHi. Based on these inconsistency is that we’re seeing in the results and because this is the first time that we’ve had the popular vote results, does this make you question the results of the 2016 Iowa caucuses and do you think that there should be a caucus system at all?\\nBernie Sanders: (16:39)\\nThat’s a good question. I don’t want to revisit 2016. All I can say is you’re right. We fought for… by the way, the fact that we now have clear results of the popular vote is something that we fought for. That did not exist in 2016. Now, I can’t give you a definitive answer as to what happened in 2016. I don’t know. I don’t think anybody knows. It turned out that in 2016 I think Secretary Clinton got one or two more delegates than we got in the state process. There is some supposition that we actually won the popular vote. I can’t say that definitively.\\nBernie Sanders: (17:17)\\nI can say definitively that in 2020 we did win the popular vote and I want to reiterate to you, so we’re clear. You’ve got 180,000 people voting. When you got eight candidates, when you win the popular vote by 6,000 votes, that is a pretty good victory. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.\\nSpeaker 12: (17:39)\\nYou’ve said the process in Iowa should not repeat itself and do you think the caucus itself should remain first?\\nBernie Sanders: (17:47)\\nI think it depends on how you do it, but the Iowa caucus is just much, much, much too complicated. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got to determine the popular vote. That you’ve got to do. If you want to talk about realignment and you could make the argument. You can make the argument, okay, what happens if somebody doesn’t get 15%, should those people have an option to go elsewhere? You can make that argument.\\nBernie Sanders: (18:06)\\nBut then when you get into calculating these SDEs, man, that is enormously complicated. I mean, the answer is what I just told you what I believe to be the case, maybe it’s not. I do believe it to be the case. We’re going to win by 6,000 votes. We will end up with the same number of delegates to the Democratic National Convention as will Mr. Buttigieg. Does that sound right? In a certain sense, it doesn’t sound right. One would think that if you win pretty good victory in the popular vote, you would get more national delegates. It’s a complicated formula and kind of… and so forth. So what will not happen again, if I have anything to say about it, is a caucus this complicated. That will not happen again. Yes, ma’am. Okay. Maybe one more question. Yes ma’am.\\nSpeaker 13: (18:53)\\nThank you. Senator, a key part of your argument for the general election, your electability is that you’re going to boost turnout by bringing all these people into the process that haven’t been voting. Iowa turnout doesn’t look like it was higher than last time. Does that concern you?\\nBernie Sanders: (19:07)\\nIt does and I would have liked to have seen a higher turnout and I think I can probably speak for every other candidate. But this is what I do want to say. I want to say where I am very excited and what I think bodes well for the overall 2020 election and that is that last year, in 2016 in the Iowa caucus in terms of voters who young people from 17 to 29, 18% of the total vote, 18% was under 29. This election, 24%. That was a very significant, very significant increase in young people participating in the Iowa caucus. And actually as I understand it, it turns out to be even higher percentage wise than the turnout of young people in 2008, when there was a massive turnout and Obama won. So that does give me a lot of optimism.\\nBernie Sanders: (20:07)\\nI believe as I have said many times that the young people of this country, the younger generation is the most progressive young generation in the modern history of this country. And to defeat Trump, we are going to have to mobilize young people who are concerned deeply about climate change. They’re concerned deeply about racism and sexism and homophobia and xenophobia. They are concerned and very worried about the kind of student debt that they are carrying. They’re worried about the cost of housing. If we can mobilize, and Iowa is a good start in that process, if we can mobilize, bring young people into the political process, I think it will have a very positive and profound impact on the general election. Thank you all very much.



       "2020-02-08  Pete Buttigieg         Transcript: Pete Buttigieg Speaks at New Hampshire Rally with Michael J. Fox                                                               Michael J. Fox: (00:11)\\nWell, thank you very much. That’s cool. That’s cool. [crosstalk 00:00:30]. Pete Buttigieg is fantastic. I was watching the debate last night and it occurred to me I love all the Democratic nominees and I think they’re all terrific and I have respect for all of them, but they’re all yelling at me. I was sitting there and I said, “Why are you yelling at me, Bernie? What did I do to you?” I said, “They’re all screaming.” But Pete isn’t screaming. He’s just talking to me. He’s the one guy who’s just quiet and just making his point and it’s a point I agree with on almost all the issues. All issues. I can’t tell you one I don’t. I’ll just allow for the possibility that he might be, “You have to wear purple on Fridays,” or something. But I want to tell a story about the first time I saw… Well, the temperament and that idea that he can talk to you and not yell at you [inaudible 00:01:35].\\nMichael J. Fox: (01:33)\\nI mean, that’s the contrast we need to make to Trump to this insanity. He said something there, just saying, okay, whatever he just said, here’s the thing. I know Pete is capable of that. I believe he’s got the ability and temperament and the intelligence to get past this current divisive, dysfunctional politics. We’re going to new low to new low. I think he’ll rise us back up to where we need to be.\\nMichael J. Fox: (02:12)\\nI first noticed Pete on a morning show, one of the morning shows, and I just had my breakfast and watching the TV. Then this guy comes on, this young guy from Indiana running for president. I had never heard of him. The host of the show is just, I won’t say the name of the show, but they’ve had three hosts and one was [inaudible 00:02:37]. I watch every day. But they were kind of playing with him at first. I could tell they thought, who is this guy? And trying to answer this and then he would answer that and then they’d say, well how about this? And he would answer that. He’d do it very quickly. He was eating his lunch. He just had every answer but it wasn’t like it wrote. It was like he was saying it whether he said it a thousand times before, I believe that he was saying it for the first time and I believed he was saying it to me.\\nMichael J. Fox: (03:10)\\nThat comes from a true place in him. He’s not trying to pull one over on me. He’s just trying to tell me the way he sees it. More times than not that that’s what I saw. We know the issues. I mean, climate change and obviously health care issues are important to me, these preexisting conditions. Because I have pre existing conditions.\\nMichael J. Fox: (03:43)\\nBut I think this comes to me. From Indiana, a veteran, a road scholar. We have a very stable road scholar. Well better than genius. That’s right. That’s what I say the J stands for. But the story, so I saw him. I was so impressed with him. Where’s my phone? I called people afterwards. I said, “This guy. Just Google Mayor Pete.” Just see what comes up. And they come back and say, this guy sounds impressive.” I said, yeah, he’s amazing. Everybody I’ve told about him, now everybody knows him, but in those earlier days immediately became followers and supporters.\\nMichael J. Fox: (04:34)\\nIt’s a quick digression, but 2006 I was campaigning for research freedom and for STEM cell research. I was traveling around with the midterm and I was supporting candidates that supported STEM cell research. I was in Chicago and I was supporting Tammy Duckworth. I was leaving and I was at the airport and there’s this guy standing by waiting for his car. He was kind of hidden away, like kind of around a corner smoking a cigarette, if I could tell the truth. It was the Senator from Illinois. It was Barack Obama and I met him. It was really honest. He was just started to make a splash and I talked to him and I was so impressed with him and I called my wife afterwards and I said, “I just met the next president of the United States.” I felt the same way when I saw Pete.\\nMichael J. Fox: (05:31)\\nI mean, working together we can not only get a lefthanded Maltese, American Episcopalian gay millennial war veteran be elected to the President of the United States, we also begin to tackle and quit talking about it, and just tackle challenges like rising healthcare costs to climate change and the gun violence epidemic so that children have a brighter future. It’s all about the future.\\nMichael J. Fox: (06:03)\\nI think it’s a real honor to be here today. It’s so great to see all of you and to be with Mayor Pete. I just want to introduce the next President of the United States. Pete Buttigieg.\\nPete Buttigieg: (06:25)\\nThank you so much. Thank you Congresswoman Annie Kuster for your support. We good? All right. All good? We’re good. We’re good. [inaudible 00:06:43]. Once again, thank you Congresswoman Annie Kuster for your support. You are lucky to have somebody representing you in New Hampshire, in Washington DC, a place where I know there’s so much frustration and exhaustion and even a sense of darkness sometimes when we turn on the news. But if you look at what Congresswoman Kuster and her colleagues are doing in the House to try to make sure that prescription drugs are affordable, to try to raise wages, to try to protect Americans from gun violence on issue after issue, they are there. Let us send them a president who will make sure that their work gets completed. One of our best conversations was about, not policy alone, but the qualities and the values that we cared about. She shared qualities and values that she had learned from her upbringing and talked a lot about courage and grace and how those two values mean so much as we’re trying to get things done together. When I think about courage and when I think about grace, I picture Michael J. Fox and I’m so honored to have you on our team.\\nPete Buttigieg: (08:06)\\nI think about strength a lot too because there are some figures in our society right now who think that strength has to do with how loud you are, how hard you can thump your chest or putting other people down. I’m not here for the strength or so-called strength of the loud mouth guy at the end of the bar. I’m here for the strength of somebody like Michael J. Fox that others can look to and know that their struggle is something they can draw courage in and move forward. I’m so honored you’re here.\\nPete Buttigieg: (08:56)\\nI’m so thankful that Jamie and the other members of our team, I know I’m very biased, but don’t we have the kindest, most energetic professional organizers and staff on this campaign? If you’ve had a chance to get to meet them, they’re just wonderful. They live out the values. We like to call them the rules of the road that are part of what makes this campaign what it is. The way that they are approaching people is such an important part of how we’ve been able to earn support and how we’re working to earn support right now in these last three days that bring us to the New Hampshire primary. I’m here one more time. If you are among those granite staters making up your mind, decision time, to ask you for your vote.\\nPete Buttigieg: (09:42)\\nI know how seriously you take that responsibility and that influence that comes with being a New Hampshire voter. I’ve seen it. I saw it in the way that you would ask tough questions and kick the tires on every idea we put forward during the campaigning in the last year. I saw it when when we felt like we were really getting somewhere and in your New Hampshire way you’d say something to me in the late fall or winter like that was a really good presentation. You are now in my top five. Now we’re so excited to be here one more time in Keene to ask you for your vote.\\nPete Buttigieg: (10:17)\\nI remember our first time turning up here, popping into Lindy’s, thrilled that we had a chance to meet literally a couple of dozen people and came to really admire the spirit of this community. Also want to share with you that since my last visit to Keene, I had the opportunity to visit the national cathedral with Jean Robinson, the former Episcopal Bishop of New Hampshire. He took me to a place near the entrance of the cathedral where carved into stone is the figure of Jonathan Daniels, a Keene native who laid down his life in the Civil Rights movement.\\nPete Buttigieg: (10:56)\\nI think it’s especially important to consider that example at a time like this in our country. Also as we acknowledge and honor Black History Month, which is about the contributions and the struggles of Black Americans, Black Americans who don’t need to be told or reminded the pain of living with systemic racism in this country. But it is also a time for those of us who have not had the lived experience of systemic racism and discrimination in the way that you do when you are African American in this country to ask of ourselves how we are making ourselves useful as allies. We can always do a better job listening. We can always show up. If Jonathan Daniels could lay down his life in that cause, surely every single American can make the cause of racial justice in this country our own.\\nPete Buttigieg: (12:03)\\nMy point is there’s a lot to draw on here in Keene by way of inspiration as we pull into these last days of this unbelievably consequential and important election. An election that I am convinced will define not just who is in the White House for the next four years, but what it’s like to be an American for the next 40. That’s what’s on the line. To think about what’s at stake and what we’ve got to do, I want to ask you to form in your mind the image that I always like to start out with that is the guiding image of this campaign in some ways. It’s the image that I’ll invite you to visualize of how it’s going to be that first time that the sun comes up-\\nPete Buttigieg: (13:03)\\n… visualize of how it’s going to be that first time that the sun comes up over the mountains and lakes of New Hampshire and Donald Trump is no longer in the White House. It’s going to be a good day, right? Aren’t you ready to put that chaos behind us? Aren’t you ready to put the corruption behind us? How about putting the tweets behind us? I don’t even think that’s a partisan statement anymore.\\nPete Buttigieg: (13:47)\\nSure, I’ve got fellow die-hard Democrats who’ve been committed to making sure that that day comes, but also I’m seeing so many independents who feel equally strongly about bringing change to this country and I’m finding an awful lot of what I like to call the future former Republicans. I see a few acknowledging right here. We are glad that you are here and you are welcome to be at our side in this struggle. We may not agree on everything, but we can agree that the time has come to deliver this change before it is too late.\\nPete Buttigieg: (14:27)\\nAnd that’s what this campaign is about. Because I am the candidate best prepared to defeat Donald Trump. Facing a fundamentally new challenge, a new political challenge, like running against him, I do not believe we can take the risk of falling back on the familiar. And in a divided time in our country, I also don’t think we can take the risk of excluding anybody from this effort, of saying that if you’re not either for a revolution or a status quo, then you don’t fit. I think we are going to defeat this president by inviting everybody to be at our side and get this done together.\\nPete Buttigieg: (15:18)\\nBut that majority we’re working to build is not just united around who we’re against, we’re even more united when it comes to what we’re for. There is a powerful American majority coming together today that can agree that we need to raise wages and empower workers in our economy. They can agree that part of how we honor our troops in uniform and in danger is to put an end to endless war and ensure they’re never asked to go, unless there is no alternative. And thanks to everybody here who served. Who can agree that we support our next generation by supporting our teachers and we ought to back them up with a Secretary of Education who believes in public education? On issue after issue, I’m seeing the majority come together that will not only make it possible to win the next election, but make it possible to govern on the road ahead, make it possible for us to actually deliver the changes that this country knows that we need, and that even though they command a majority among the American people, up until now can’t seem to get a majority in the American Senate. Now’s our chance to change that.\\nPete Buttigieg: (16:54)\\nAnd the way we change that is to build a politics that insists on the idea that government and elections are not about the ups and downs in the polls. They’re not about who got the best zinger off in a debate. They’re not about who’ll look good on television. They’re about everyday life. That’s why even though I’m ready to go toe to toe with this president, you won’t see me talking about him that much because the less we’re talking about him, the more we can talk about you and about our everyday lives.\\nPete Buttigieg: (17:29)\\nI believe every election is about the voter’s question, “How’s my life going to be different, my everyday life, if you’re president, instead of you.” That’s how I think about it. That’s how Chasten and I come to politics. Knowing that my mother-in-law’s struggle, his mother’s struggle, with cancer depends on the ability to get chemotherapy through insurance that she wouldn’t be able to get it all if it weren’t for the Affordable Care Act. Knowing that the course of my own life was changed by the orders that sent me to a foreign war, issued by a decision made in the White House. Knowing that my marriage, most important thing in my life, this ring on my finger, exists by the grace of a single vote on the United States Supreme Court. That’s what this election means to all of us, to each of us, in a different way. And it’s not even just about voters. Because so many of the most powerful voices I have encountered in this campaign are people not even yet old enough to vote. An 11-year-old who sticks up his hand at an event and asks me what we’re going to do so that he’ll be able to afford insulin in the future. He’s worried about this at the age of 11. And the only responsible answer is that we, anybody old enough to vote, is supposed to sort this out and take care of it and worry about it so you don’t have to. A 14-year-old who lets me know she’s written a will because she’s that afraid of what’ll happen to her at school. Shame on us if we don’t take care of that by the time she is old enough to vote.\\nPete Buttigieg: (19:25)\\nA 10-year-old who came to an event and pointedly reminded me, and of course I like to think of myself as the youngster in this field, but pointed out that he was planning to be here in the year 2100 and will look back on the decisions we made in 2020 to decide whether the climate future for him and his kids and grandkids would be one where they could actually thrive, that this is the decision point that he will be looking back on, as so many of us will. That is who we are seeking to defend, to support, and to do right by. So that by the time they’re old enough to vote, certainly by the time they’re old enough to run for office, they’re worried about a whole other set of issues we can’t even think of because every election is about preparing for the future.\\nPete Buttigieg: (20:13)\\nOn that day of that sunrise I was talking about, America will be confronting challenges the likes of which weren’t even thought about just a few years ago, an economy transformed by gig work and technology, a climate this close to the point of no return, and oversees everything from global health security threats and pandemics to election security and cybersecurity challenges barely understood, let alone talked about by presidential candidates just a few years ago. That’s what we’re up against. But that is also why we now have the opportunity to look to the future and that is why there is not a decision to be made between what it takes to win big and what it takes to govern well. Both of those require the very same thing, which is a focus on the future and a readiness to turn the page.\\nPete Buttigieg: (21:03)\\nIn other words, the reason I’m doing this and the reason I’m asking for your support for this office is not that I got it into my head one day that I would like to occupy it. It’s about what the office is for. I’m here based on the idea that the presidency has a purpose and that the purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president, it’s the empowerment and the unification of the American people to deal with these big problems and face our future together. That’s what this is about and that’s why I’m asking for your support.\\nPete Buttigieg: (21:48)\\nNow, our numbers at our events have grown a little bit since I first poked my head in at Lindy’s, but I still figured there’s no such thing as a room too big to have some kind of a conversation. So with help from Congresswoman Kuster and the famous fishbowl, we’ve gathered up questions from different folks on your way in, and I’ll do my best to be concise and respond to as many as I can. And if you hear yours, please give a wave and a holler so that I’m looking at you as we do.\\nCongresswoman Kuster: (22:11)\\nOkay. Mayor Pete, what will you do to strengthen Social Security and Medicare?\\nPete Buttigieg: (22:20)\\nGreat question. So let’s begin by correcting a couple of myths or problems in the way this is talked about. First of all, the word “entitlement.” We hear that a lot to describe Social Security and Medicare. Well, as a voter put it recently, I don’t know if this term will catch on, but I like it. He stood up and said, “I don’t think of it as an entitlement. I think of it as a paid-into-ment because I’ve been paying for it my whole working life.”\\nPete Buttigieg: (22:50)\\nAnd so when we’re talking about Social Security and Medicare, we’re not talking about doing anybody a favor, we’re talking about keeping a promise that is made by every worker to the public. And that is why we have to make sure that it’s on good solid ground. Now there are some folks who say, “Well, we’re not going to be able to keep Social Security solvent unless we cut benefits.” But it isn’t true. It’s only true if we refuse to look at revenue. All we’ve got to do is raise the cap on income over $250,000 and allow that to pay into Social Security. We take that one step, that one step alone, and the Social Security trust fund will be in good shape, at least into the 2050s when I expect to be collecting. So I’ve got a bit of a personal stake in this. And we’ll be in a position to increase the generosity of the program too in certain important ways. I’ll give you one that I think is particularly important, caregiving for loved ones. Family caregiving is not considered work. Well, at least it’s not compensated as work. But it’s work, especially when it takes you out of the workforce in order to do it. And so even though you don’t get a W-2 for taking care of a loved one, I believe for the purposes of Social Security, a year spent as a family caregiver should count as a year in the working world.\\nPete Buttigieg: (24:25)\\nNow, on Medicare, it’s a different set of challenges. There really is a fiscal challenge to keeping Medicare afloat. But again, it’s up to us to decide whether we can make the adjustments that are needed to make sure that it runs well. This is not about cuts. This is about making sure that we take common sense steps to get the finances right. And the biggest one, one so obvious to Americans of both parties that it’s astonishing that it hasn’t gotten done, but we can change it if we change Washington, is this. Medicare should be able to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs with prescription drug companies. You take that one step, it goes a huge way toward being able to shore up Medicare. Thanks for asking about those programs.\\nCongresswoman Kuster: (25:09)\\nOkay, from a young friend, this one, Anderson Kohler, age nine. “I like that…” Oh, right here. Thank you, Anderson.\\nPete Buttigieg: (25:19)\\nHi.\\nCongresswoman Kuster: (25:19)\\nWhat a good guy. Thank you for this. “I like that you say, ‘I think that kids shouldn’t have to have active shooter drills before they can read.’ Can you talk more about how you plan to help with this? Thank you.”\\nPete Buttigieg: (25:44)\\nWell, Anderson, thanks for coming, first of all. I love your tie. Your question deserves a serious answer. And I want to begin with an apology on behalf of anybody old enough to vote because, like I was saying earlier, we’re supposed to take care of that sort of thing so that you can concentrate on being-\\nPete Buttigieg: (26:03)\\nWe’re supposed to take care of that sort of thing so that you can concentrate on being nigh. My promise is that we’re going to take steps to make sure that you don’t have to worry about these kinds of things when you’re going to school. You’ve got enough to deal with. What grade are you in? Third grade. Third grade is hard. You’ve got a lot of stuff to figure out.\\nPete Buttigieg: (26:19)\\nI want to let you concentrate on third grade. Here’s some things we can do. First of all, we need to check the background of anybody who tries to buy a weapon. Now most Americans think we ought to do it, including most Republicans and most gun owners. Again, Annie Kuster and her colleagues in the House passed a bill to do it, but it keeps getting stuck in the Senate because we have a president who won’t take the step of pushing it through. We need to make sure that everybody gets their background checked and there are all these little loopholes and ways to sneak around it. We’ve got to put an end to that. That’s one.\\nPete Buttigieg: (26:59)\\nAnother is a kind of law called the Red Flag Law, and the idea is… Some folks know what that means. Imagine somebody waving a red flag because they know that there’s danger up ahead. That’s what it’s like. Only this time it’s not actually somebody waving a flag. It’s if somebody realizes that another person they know is potentially going to be dangerous to themselves or to others. Being able to take steps to make sure that they don’t have access to a weapon until that can get sorted out. The third thing that we’ve got to do is think about the kinds of weapons that are being sold in America. When I was in the military, I was responsible for learning how to use certain kinds of weapons that are designed for war, weapons anything like what I had to deal with in the military, have no place being sold anywhere near your school for profit. We’re going to actively make sure that doesn’t happen. Those are some of the steps we’ll take to keep you safe. Thanks for your question.\\nCongresswoman Kuster: (28:06)\\nThank you, Anderson. My first presidential campaign rally, I was nine years old. So one day you’ll be up here. All right, Pete. A classic New Hampshire question. This one’s important to all of us. Even if folks in Washington have stopped paying attention. What’s your stand on the deficit?\\nPete Buttigieg: (28:28)\\nGood. Again, if you want to… That’s probably a lot of folks here. I think the time has come for my party to get a lot more comfortable talking about the deficit. Because right now, we’ve got a president who comes from the party that used to talk a lot about fiscal responsibility with a trillion dollar deficit and no plan in sight for what to do about it. Yes, this should concern progressives who are not in the habit of talking or worrying too much about the debt and here’s why. Service on the debt is going to start crowding out investment in safety net and health and infrastructure and education programs that are important. That’s one.\\nPete Buttigieg: (29:12)\\nAnother is that we’re in an expansion right now. When we’re in a recession, you need enough room in the budget to be able to do the kind of stimulus that helps get us out of a recession. Not a lot of room left when you got a trillion dollar deficit already. The third concern, especially for a younger generation is the longer you’re planning to be here, the more likely you might be here when some of these fiscal time bombs start to go off. So we need to act to make sure that our country’s finances are under control.\\nPete Buttigieg: (29:48)\\nThat doesn’t have to be a knockdown argument against making big investments. I’m proposing big investments, but you’ll notice two things about my plans. One, I’m careful about what we promise. I think we ought to take a major step forward in healthcare in America, but I figured out a way to do it that costs one and a half trillion dollars over a decade. No small sum of money, but instead of 20 or 30 or 40 or some of my competition even saying you don’t deserve an explanation on how much it’s going to cost. It’s impossible to tell. No. We’ve got to make sure that we’re making promises we can keep.\\nPete Buttigieg: (30:22)\\nSame thing with college. When it comes to college, we are going to make sure that cost is no longer a barrier. We’re going to enact a program that would cover actually all of your tuition for about 80% of Americans in public colleges. But if you’re in that top income bracket, I still wish you well. But I’m looking for you to go ahead and pay your own tuition because those tax dollars are so precious. Part of it’s on the side of spending.\\nPete Buttigieg: (31:00)\\nI’ve put together a bold package that’s the most ambitious that we’ve seen from certainly relative to any nominee we’ve had recently, but it’s a manageable number. The other side is we can’t be afraid to talk about revenue. This is not about hitting the middle-class with more taxes. This is about the fact that in a world where you and I pay federal income taxes, but companies like Amazon and Chevron pay precisely zero on billions of dollars in profits. Something is out of whack in the system and you don’t have to be a die hard Democrat to know that those corporations and the wealthiest Americans ought to have to pay their fair share.\\nPete Buttigieg: (31:42)\\nThat’s why at least one outside group has scored the major campaigns, proposals looked at everything we said we want to invest in and every way we said we’re going to raise the revenue to do it. I’m very proud to tell you that when you look at ours, ours is the one that’s actually in the black and starts reducing the deficit over time.\\nCongresswoman Kuster: (31:58)\\nAll right. They like that one. This is from Lisa in Rindge, New Hampshire. She’s a special educator and the parent of a special needs child that she adopted through foster care.\\nPete Buttigieg: (32:14)\\nHi, Lisa.\\nCongresswoman Kuster: (32:18)\\nLisa is an adoption attorney for 25 years. Thank you very much. All right. I love this question. What advice would you give to Americans to help our country and as president, what would you ask of our citizens?\\nPete Buttigieg: (32:34)\\nWhat a great question. First of all, Lisa, thank you for your work and your advocacy. We need more to go into your field. The president when he was inaugurated said, “I alone can fix it.” But I think we know that it doesn’t work that way. No one person, president or otherwise can fix big problems alone. I think it’s especially fitting here in New Hampshire where you have the culture of service where so many run for office and hold office here in New Hampshire. You don’t get to just say, “Why don’t they do this? Why don’t they fix this road? Or why don’t they change that law?” The spirit is why don’t we? I see that everywhere from frankly the sheer number of folks who are involved in elected office in Concord to the tradition of the town meeting. This is a very well understood civic responsibility in New Hampshire.\\nPete Buttigieg: (33:31)\\nWe need to make sure that we’re reinforcing a national culture of involvement, whether it’s in public processes or whether it’s in just rolling up your sleeves and getting stuff done. It’s one of the reasons why I’m proposing as a country we create a million paid voluntary national service opportunities a year. We know how much work there is to be done. I’m proposing a climate corps where people could work directly on things like weatherizing the homes of low income homeowners and seniors, an intergenerational corps that helps connect an older generation with the younger one serving one another, learning, mentoring and growing. And a community health corps that can make a difference whether it’s supporting neighbors with disabilities or whether it’s making sure that we’re getting ahead of some of the behavioral health and addiction challenges that we face in so many of our communities and cultivating an interest in the career of doing it.\\nPete Buttigieg: (34:35)\\nPart of it is that the work is out there needing to be done, but part of it is something else. It’s that in our country that so badly needs to be healed and unified, we need more experiences in common. We have been so divided, we even get our information in different places. It feels like people are getting their own facts. So whenever we have something in common just to share an experience, it becomes a touchstone that reminds us we’re all Americans. For me, military service was that touchstone. I can have a conversation with somebody from maybe a different branch in a different generation and served in different places, but we have that thing in common. When I was deployed, there were people I was deployed with who were radically different from me. I mean regionally, racially, politically. Definitely politically very different. But we learned to trust each other with our lives because we had a job to do. I want every American to have that kind of connection without having to go to war in order to get it. That’s why I think national service is such a powerful idea.\\nCongresswoman Kuster: (35:43)\\nOkay. The last word goes to Canny. How can we protect vulnerable disabled people and elders if Medicare goes to block grants to save money?\\nPete Buttigieg: (35:57)\\nVery good. When they talk about block grants for Medicaid, that’s another word for cutting Medicaid. We shouldn’t allow them to play these language trips. What’s the new one called? They rolled it out in the white house a few days ago. Adult healthy… I’m going to try not to say something unrepeatable here, but let’s just say we got a call a Medicaid cut, a Medicaid cut and that’s what that is. Yes, it is harming some of our most vulnerable Americans. Everything that they say they care about that we all know we care about from ensuring that people of any background get access to the care that they need to breaking addiction. Lives. You want to talk about the opioid crisis, lives depend on Medicaid to help deal with that. To ensuring that those who need longterm care are able to get it. The exact wrong direction to move in is these block grants that make cuts.\\nPete Buttigieg: (36:59)\\nLet’s talk about something else that I think folks across the aisle can agree on, supporting rural communities. Do you know what most of the hospital closures in rural areas in America have in common right now is that they’re in states that did not expand Medicaid when they had the chance? So supporting Medicaid and I think Medicaid is what’s on your mind with the block grants, right? Supporting Medicaid and Medicare is also a question of how we support rural economic development and the ability to live in rural communities because we won’t have rural hospitals if we don’t have that kind of funding. If we want to tackle racial inequity in health right now, a big part of that is making sure that we have the resources to allow everybody to get access to care.\\nPete Buttigieg: (37:43)\\nIt’s not only about coverage. We’ve also got to deal with implicit bias. We’ve got to have more diverse medical providers. We’ve got to deal with a whole set of problems, but part of it is insurance. Even veterans. There’s more to taking care of veterans than the VA. Actually a majority of veterans get their medical care outside of the VA because they might not have a service connected issue or because of their financial situation. We have a responsibility to make sure that the whole system is shored up and yes, that means protecting Medicaid from these kinds of cuts.\\nCongresswoman Kuster: (38:13)\\nThank you.

       "2020-10-15  Donald Trump           Donald Trump Campaign Rally Greenville, NC Transcript October 15                                                                           Donald Trump: (01:25)\\nThank you very much. Thank you. Let’s see, it’s 1:30. This is a hell of a crowd for 1:30 in the afternoon. Thank you.\\nDonald Trump: (01:41)\\nGreat state. It’s fantastic to be back in North Carolina with thousands of loyal, hard working Americans patriots. 19 days from now, think of that, 19 days, do you believe this? We’re going to win the State of North Carolina, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins. Do you see what’s going on? When we win, North Carolina wins and America wins. It’s very simple.\\nDonald Trump: (02:22)\\nFor the last 47 years. Joe Biden’s betrayed the workers of North Carolina through one act of economic treachery after another and now you see what’s happening. They got caught stealing folks. Biden’s a servant of the wealthy donors and globalist and special interests who got rich bleeding America dry, taking your jobs from North Carolina and every other place and moving them out of the country. We turned it around. You got to remember that.\\nDonald Trump: (02:56)\\nThese corrupt forces, they don’t see our nation as a protector of its citizens, but as a vehicle for personal profit and power at your expense, and you see it happening right now. They hold everyone in contempt and they always put the American worker last and that’s what’s happened until I came along. In fact, it’s the primary reason I came along if you think about it.\\nDonald Trump: (03:24)\\nThey keep their jobs while outsourcing your jobs to other countries, countries that you’ve never even heard about. They build walls for themselves while forcing your family to suffer the consequences of illegal immigration, drugs, and crime. You know it very well over here.\\nDonald Trump: (03:42)\\nFor five decades, Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars, and you know, they’re all coming back, they’re almost back, our great soldiers. Our great soldiers. Countries you’d never even heard about. He’s the embodiment of the political class that enriched itself while draining economic life and soul out of our country.\\nDonald Trump: (04:15)\\nYesterday, we learned from newly released emails, and I want to thank the New York Post for showing real bravery, that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and he has been corrupt for many years and everybody in Washington knew it.\\nDonald Trump: (04:46)\\nAnd just now, a little while ago, a new story shows up that Hunter made a deal with a wealthy Chinese business magnet for $10 million a year for introductions only. Introductions. I don’t know, “Will you take 10 million a year to introduce people?” “Yeah to introduce dad. Dad say hello, and by the way, dad give them everything they want. Okay? Give them everything they want dad.”\\nDonald Trump: (05:14)\\nHunter also referred to another more lasting and lucrative arrangement with the same Chinese businessman that, “Would be so much more interesting to me and my family,” that’s what he said. That’s a quote. These deals were made at the same time Joe Biden was letting China steal your jobs and take away your factories.\\nDonald Trump: (05:34)\\nIf Biden is elected, the United States will be owned by China, but we don’t have to worry about it because I can’t believe it’s going to happen. He’s shot, just so we understand. We cannot have a leader that’s just about half-shot. Can we believe we’re even fighting against this guy? But you know what? They’re a powerful party. They’re very corrupt party. They’re in bed with the media, the fake news, right back there.\\nDonald Trump: (06:13)\\nAnd totally protected by big tech. If I said what he said, they’d be calling for me out of there in 24 hours, what this guy has said. Two days ago, he said, “I’m running for the United States Senate.” That’s the third time he said it, “I’m running for the …” Now, that’s not like a regular mistake. You can make a mistakes. He said that, and then he said other things, but we won’t even get into it. This is crazy. This is the craziest race.\\nDonald Trump: (06:41)\\nYou know what? I’m running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics, and if I lose, it puts more pressure. I wish he was good. I wish he was good, I’d have less pressure. You know what I mean? How do you lose to a guy like this? Like how do you lose to a guy like this? And by the way, we’re leading in North Carolina, a poll just came in. I think we’re leading everywhere where people are intelligent actually. And you actually … We just got a report, the lines are through the roof on areas that would more typically vote for us. I’m trying to be diplomatic when I say that. Thank you. But this election is a matter of national security. It really is. We can’t let this happen. It’s a matter of national security. The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. Now, big tech, you see what’s going on with big tech? Is censoring these stories to try and get Biden out of this impossible jam. He’s in a big jam. You know, his son left his laptop at some place, “Fix my laptop.” He forgot to pick it up. The guy from the laptop, it looks like he saw it. He said, “Wow, this is really criminal stuff.” He brought it to the FBI. Can you believe this?\\nDonald Trump: (08:13)\\nThis could only happen to me and the people of North Carolina, no this could only happen to us. Can you imagine, he’s fixing a laptop? He says, “This is really bad stuff. I think I’ll bring it into law enforcement.” Anyway, they’ve got it. They’ve got a lot of them. I hear they have stuff coming out you won’t even believe, yeah you’ll believe it. He and his family are crooked and they were caught. They got caught. Now they’re being protected by big tech and if big tech persists in coordination with the mainstream media, we must immediately strip them of their Section 230 protection. Okay, it’s very simple.\\nDonald Trump: (08:52)\\nWe all believe in freedom of the press, but don’t big tech got something years ago that let them become big tech, they got total protection. They don’t get sued. They don’t get anything, they’re totally protected. So the government gave that, so that takes away that little feeling that, “Oh gee, we can’t talk to them about freedom of the press, et cetera.” No, we’re going to take away their Section 230, unless they shape up.\\nDonald Trump: (09:20)\\nBelieve it or not, even the Democrats agree. Of course, the only problem we have when they say that we’re against, it’s like the wall, you know, we’re building the wall? It’s going up. It was so hard. It was so hard getting that done. There was very few people who could have gotten that done. We’re up over 400 miles, but here’s what’s happened. I just think back. All I had to say is, “We will not build a wall,” they would’ve given me so much money. I had to say we were building it, but we got to going and we have the safest Southern border we’ve ever had so that’s all good.\\nDonald Trump: (09:53)\\nIn 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president of the United States who put America first. And we’ve done a job. We’ve done a great job. It’s been amazing. Our comeback, nobody’s ever done anything like what we did, and then we got hit by the China plague. Shouldn’t have let it happen. We’re now coming back at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. Nobody thought it was possible. They thought we’d be at 42% unemployment. We just had 7.8%. Can you believe it?\\nDonald Trump: (10:42)\\nNow, we were in 3.5%? I even went to North Carolina. I needed a good chief of staff. I said, “Where is he? Where’s Mark Meadows?” Where’s Mark? Where’s Mark? Come here Mark. Come here. Can you imagine? I had to go to North Carolina to find my chief of staff. No, he’s great. No, he’s done a great job. He’s done a great job. He followed me and I said, “You know what? I just tested positive.” He didn’t care. He was in that helicopter. Hey, he’s from North Carolina, what can I say? Yeah, he’s great. Doing a great job.\\nDonald Trump: (11:40)\\nYou elected me to restore the principle that’s a nation’s first duty, and it’s to its own citizens. We’re about our country, right? I’m president of our country. We’re not president of the world. We’re not president of the world. The USA. So if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always seem to be playing by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than any other president has ever fought for our country’s people.\\nDonald Trump: (12:25)\\nRight now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus and we’re doing really a good job. We’re rounding the turn. You see what’s going on in Europe? It’s flaming up. These characters back there, they say, “Well look at Europe.” Well, I’ll tell you what, go take a look, go take a look. No, we’re doing a great job. We’re doing a great job. They didn’t give the credit. I don’t want the credit. But our vice president worked 24 hours a day, Mike Pence. And we had a lot of governors. They worked with us, but we had some that were really good, and some that were really not so good. I’ll let you know one day, I’ll write a little book and I’ll tell you who the good ones were.\\nDonald Trump: (13:06)\\nWe made a lot of people look good. We’ve done a great job. We have some incredible statistics, but we want to rebuild the economy and that’s happening quickly. We had the greatest economy we’ve ever had. Think of it. Now, we closed it down and we saved 2 million lives by closing it down. We closed it down and now we’re building it back up, and by the way, North Carolina, tell you governor, “Open up your state, open up your schools.” Right? Right?\\nDonald Trump: (13:43)\\nThey’ll announce on November 4th, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’re opening up by North Carolina, and by the way, Pennsylvania.” You know, we’ve been suing a lot of states that are run by Democrats, right? I always call them high crime. But the fact is that’s where the crime is. But we’ve been suing a lot of people and we just won in Michigan against … what she did was terrible. I mean, she did … It’s like a prison warden. So Michigan, we won on a constitutional basis to have to open it up. You got to open this one up. I mean the people want to get back. The kids want to be back in school, 99.9%.\\nDonald Trump: (14:22)\\nLike you heard yesterday, they announced, my Baron, my tall Baron, he’s very tall. My beautiful Baron, and handsome, he is handsome, but my beautiful Baron had it, he recovered like so fast. I said, “Wait a minute. How long did that take?” They have the strongest immune systems, they’re better than all of us. That’s what they are, they’re kids, for some reason. But we’ve learned about this disease. You got to open up your businesses, open up your schools, get it going.\\nDonald Trump: (14:49)\\nWe have incredible therapeutics, have incredible drugs. We have, in my opinion, a cure because I took something, Regeneron. It was highly sophisticated stuff, the antibodies, and Eli Lilly makes an incredible drug. What we’ve done is incredible. This is all been over the last six months. It’s all happened. We got the FDA for fast approvals. They would have taken years and years and they’re doing it … They came to me on one, “Sir, this will take approximately two years.” I said, “Nope, I needed to prove tomorrow.” They said, “That’s not good.” We got it too. We got it.\\nDonald Trump: (15:23)\\nBut this is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain, in exchange for his party’s nomination, he has handed control of the socialists … I mean he’s given control of this party, the Democrats, they used to be like normal people. Now they’re socialists, Marxists, communists. That’s right. You said it, I didn’t say it, communists. Some people would say far left lunatics. Look at the Green New Deal.\\nDonald Trump: (15:55)\\nWell, don’t clap too hard. Go out and vote. We’ll clap later because these people are crazy. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country because they’re addicted to power, and God help us if they win, we won’t have our country anymore, and it’ll never be able to come back. They never do.\\nDonald Trump: (16:15)\\nIf you look at 20 years ago, Venezuela had oil, it had wealth, less than 20 years ago, it had everything. Now they don’t have water. They don’t have food. They don’t have medicine. They have nothing but killing all over their streets. This happened in a short period of time and it’s the same ideology. You see it. The Democrat party talks about decency and decorum while they demonize and cancel, you know the word cancel, right? They want to cancel your culture and persecute anyone who refuses to bend to their will. I don’t think they like me too much, do they? They don’t like me too much. That’s really an honor. That’s an honor. You know why? Because those words, nobody has ever heard them at a political event. I liked Ronald Reagan and they’d say, “We like you Ronald Reagan,” but nobody’s ever heard those words, right? “We love you.” No, seriously? What politician has ever heard those words? I’ve never said those words and that happens and I consider that a great honor and thank you very much. Thank you.\\nDonald Trump: (17:39)\\nBut the Democrats smear decent Americans as racist, slander our nation as evil. Indoctrinate our children and incite anti-American riots on our streets that we could control in 25 minutes, as we did in Minneapolis, as we do wherever we go, but they have to invite us in. By law, they have to invite us in. We want to go to Portland so bad. That one would take 15 minutes to set. 15 minutes.\\nDonald Trump: (18:08)\\nThe man that shot another innocent man, this was an innocent man shot, killed, instantly killed. I said, “What happened?” “Well, we haven’t arrested him.” Two days. Three days went by. We sent in the US Marshals, it took 15 minutes, it was over. 15 minutes it was over. We got him. They knew who he was. They didn’t want to arrest him and 15 minutes that ended.\\nDonald Trump: (18:34)\\nAnyway, and they call themselves peaceful protesters. In theory, we’re not supposed to be … and look at all the masks. They keep saying, “Nobody wears masks, wear the masks.” Although then they come out with things today. Did you see, the CDC? That 85% of the people wearing the mask catch it, okay?\\nDonald Trump: (18:55)\\nThen you have my friend, and he’s a nice guy, Tony, Tony Fauci. He’s a nice guy. He said, “This is not a threat. This is not a problem. Don’t worry about it, [inaudible 00:19:04] a problem.” It’s the craziest thing. Then he said, “Do not wear a mask. Do not wear a mask under any circumstances. Don’t wear a mask. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.” Right? So we don’t wear a mask. Then they say, “Oh, wear a mask.” I never saw … Do you ever see any conflicts? But he’s a nice guy. So I keep him around. Right? We’ll keep him around.\\nDonald Trump: (19:22)\\nHe’s a Democrat, everybody knows that. He’s Cuomo’s friend. Cuomo did the worst job of any governor in the United States. Almost 40,000 people died, more, and 11,000 at least, and you know, I gave him this big convention center, 2,800 beds. He didn’t use it. I gave him a ship. I gave him the great hospital ship meant for wars, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of incredible … You have to see the ship. I’ve been on it many times, it’s incredible. They didn’t use it. Instead, they sent sick people back into nursing homes, right? It’s a disgrace. The Democrat party is ashamed of America. The Republican party is proud of America and that’s a big difference. A big difference. Thank you.\\nDonald Trump: (20:28)\\nSo you know, I’m being set up tonight, right? So I’m doing this town hall with a Concast, C-O-N, right? Con, because it’s a con-job, Concast, C-O-N, not C-O-M. C-O-N-cast. So I’m doing it, and it’s NBC, the worst. It’s the home of sleepy eyes, Chuck Todd, and some others. They gave Lester Holt, he’s a beauty. They gave Joe Biden, a week ago, a town hall, and it was meant for children. In fact, speaking of Baron Trump, he fully recovered in like record time, Baron Trump would do great …\\nDonald Trump: (21:03)\\nTrump fully recovered in record time. Barron Trump would do great on that show, because he’s a young child. They ask him questions that a child could answer, any child, a smart child, not such a smart child. And they got taken apart. It was a joke. It was a joke. And so they asked me if I’d do it, and I figured, what the hell? We get a free hour on television, and we have Savannah Guthrie. She’s always lovely, isn’t she? But I figure, why not? Watch the difference in tone between what they did to this guy, that kid put two sentences together, and what they do to me. But with me, it’s me. It’s a life. We know what we’re doing and we just go on and we do it, but they’re doing him on doing him on ABC. And actually I’d like to watch him because I want to see if he can make it through the program.\\nDonald Trump: (21:51)\\nAnd, honestly, they’ll be so soft. George Stephanopoulos, I did him a couple of weeks ago. It was fine. His questions were unfair. They said that the audience is neutral. Turned out that they only had Never-Trumpers in there. But these are minor, little minor facts. Well, that happened with the other guy too. It was supposed to be neutral. It turned out that they were all big Democrats, right? Big Democrats. Because you know what? The fake news media is corrupt. It’s corrupt, and we’ve shown it so many times. So I’ll see you later on NBC, I look forward to it. We’re going to be doing it from Miami, where we’re doing very well in Florida too, by the way. We just got numbers back. Doing very well. And the senior citizens are liking us, I think, more and more every day. Every day, they see what we’re doing. Every single day. But we’re going to be doing that from Florida, so you’ll watch tonight. If you want to have a little entertainment, watch.\\nDonald Trump: (22:47)\\nLet’s just see. I just want to see the tone of the way they treated this character and the way they treat us. It’s not me, it’s us, the way they treat us. So the candidate whose supporters are burning American flags, and I say all the time, let’s put in some kind of a major, major resolution, you burn an American flag, you spent one year in jail. Do it.\\nSpeaker 1: (23:12)\\nU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nDonald Trump: (23:31)\\nSee, that’s where the politicians are weak. The politicians could do this. That’s where they’re weak, the politicians. And I think it lost five to four in the Supreme Court. Now we have a different Supreme Court. Hey, by the way, can you imagine, we’re going to have number three in one term, which is a record, a record. President’s go an entire, Presidency, one term, two terms, without ever having to pick a Supreme Court. I have three in the first term. Their heads are exploding. These people can’t believe it. You know what? Our friends over here, they can’t believe what’s happening, I’ll tell you. But we have three. And how good is Amy? How good is Amy?\\nSpeaker 1: (24:14)\\nFill that seat! Fill that seat!\\nDonald Trump: (24:27)\\nIt’s happening.\\nSpeaker 1: (24:28)\\nFill that seat!\\nDonald Trump: (24:31)\\nThey said, “He should not be able to do this.” I said, “Why? I’m in my fourth year.” “He should not be allowed to do it.” But then they have a quote from Justice Ginsburg talking about, I guess it was Obama, right, that, “Well, wait a minute. He’s elected for four years. He’s not elected for three years.” That didn’t help them. That didn’t help their cause. No, we got it done. It looks like it’s going to be done very soon. They have a one week period where they sit, but they’re getting out of committee and it’s very exciting. And I’ll tell you what, she’s been flawless. She hasn’t made a mistake. She’s toying with those Democrat evil people. They’re evil. The way they treated Justice Kavanaugh was one of the greatest disgraces. I’ve never seen anything like it, and I’ve watched a lot of unfair things. I get treated that way all the time.\\nDonald Trump: (25:23)\\nBut I want to tell you, I’ve never seen anything like it, the way they went after Justice Kavanaugh with false accusations and everything else. It’s a disgrace, but they’re not playing that card here. They’re not playing that card, at least so far they’re not, but we’ll be watching very closely. But she’s been spectacular. She’s getting rave reviews. She’s a great intellect. Her professor, who was a great professor many years, said the single greatest student that he’s ever had. That meant something to him. It’s always nice. As long as you’re doing it, you might as well put smart people. Now, they’ll say, “He discriminates. He discriminates against others.” No, I like to have smart people on the Supreme Court, and she’s been great.\\nDonald Trump: (26:03)\\nBut the candidate whose supporters are tearing down our statues is not going to deliver any civility. And by the way, we solve every problem. And these are Democrat, radical left usually, but Democrat areas that are having these high crime. The Republicans are doing fantastically well, remember it. No cash bail. They do things that nobody could even conceive of and they’re out of control. But you know what’s going to bring it all together? Success, because we were bringing it all together before the plague came in from China. Should have never happened. They shouldn’t have let it happen. They let it happen. We’re not forgetting. They’ll pay for it. But before the plague came in from China … Well, Biden’s not going to make them pay. He’s going to get cash. They paid his son a lot of money. What’s he going to do? Say, “Hey, you shouldn’t do this.”\\nDonald Trump: (26:54)\\nAnd that’s true. That’s common sense. Look at the money they’ve out of China. I’ll tell you what, he really is, he’s a corrupt politician, just remember it. And I’m going to say it more and more, and Facebook and all can try and shut us down. But you know what? Everybody knows it. You don’t have a kid who gets thrown out of the military, hasn’t got a job for a long time, his father becomes the Vice President, and now this kid’s going into every country, walking away with millions of dollars from every country with no talent, no skill, no expertise. And the press doesn’t want to cover it because they’re corrupt. Is that true? I mean, how true is that? And then you look at the way Joe Biden lives. He lives on a politician’s salary for his whole life. 47 years, right? And he lives in these beautiful houses all over the place.\\nDonald Trump: (27:45)\\nI haven’t seen him, but he’s a politician and you’re not supposed to live like you’ve made $20 million a year. So he’s corrupt as hell and everyone knows it. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your job, and that’s what they’ve done. They’ve killed your jobs, dismantle your police departments, and that’s what they’re doing. Dissolve your borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes by four times. And how about this? How about the fracking? There will be no fracking. That’s when everybody was against, because the super radical left primaries, right? There will be no fracking. Here’s Biden. “No, I said there will be. How many times do I have to say it? There will be no fracking.” Now he gets the nomination. The following day, he said, “No, that will be fracking.” And I said, “Okay, he’s going to get killed by the media on this.” They never even asked him the question.\\nDonald Trump: (28:41)\\nI hope you’re watching Pennsylvania because you will lose one million fracking jobs almost immediately, because you know what? Joe has no control over that party. That’s all AOC and Crazy Bernie and all these maniacs. But we were coming together really well. I was getting calls from people that normally I wouldn’t want and they wouldn’t want me, and they’re saying, “It’s amazing.” We had the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had. We had 160 million people working. Think about it, 160 million. We were never even close. We were beating China at a level that they’ve never been beaten before. I was charging them tariffs. They didn’t know what the hell to do. And they were always going to overtake us in 2019. If you go back 15, 20 years, 10 years, China was always going to overtake us, 2019. Well, in 2019, we became much, much bigger and we were way overtaking them and they weren’t even close to overtaking us. It was just the opposite.\\nDonald Trump: (29:48)\\nWe were coming together as a country because everything was good. Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, people with diplomas, people without diplomas, people with no high school education, PhDs from MIT, everybody was coming together. And then we had the plague. But that’s going to bring us together again because you had your best year in the history of your state. You had the best year last year in the history of your state. You’re going to have a better year coming up. This is going to be a better year. And watch your third quarter, watch your third quarter. But the radical Democrats will confiscate your guns, destroy your suburbs. I keep hearing about the suburban women. The American dream, it is. I let you have the American dream. I wiped out a regulation that will destroy the suburbs. Do you know that? You know about that. I wiped it out, right? They don’t want to have a project built next to their beautiful house, right?\\nDonald Trump: (31:03)\\nSo why is it that the fake news keeps saying that women aren’t going to like Trump? You know what women want more than anything else? They want safety, security, and they want to be able to have their houses and leave me alone. The suburban woman. And then early on, before I realized it wasn’t politically correct, sorry, folks, haven’t been doing this too long, I said, “The suburban housewife loves Trump.” And by the way, the women, they loved it. Does anybody mind that term? Is that a bad term? The only people that mind it are those people there with the cameras. Look at them. Look how innocent they look, and they’re not innocent. They’re not innocent. The enemy of the people. I call them the enemy of the people. But, anyway, so the suburban women should love Trump. Now, this is the same thing, this is like a carbon copy of what happened last time, not nearly as bad.\\nDonald Trump: (32:03)\\nRemember, you had nine states. I was going to lose all of them the day before. And they were just wrong a little bit. I won all of them. I was going to lose all nine. They said, “This will be a horrible evening for Donald Trump.” That wasn’t President Trump. That was Donald Trump. “This evening will be over very shortly.” Then we went and Florida. We win North Carolina, by the way. We win South Carolina. We win Georgia. We ran the coast. We just ran it one after another. And remember it said, they had this little crazy chart on NBC, and that’s when the people started crying that worked there. “Oh my God, what am I going to tell my wife after two and a half years of saying, he’s not going to make it.” And remember it said 3%. I had a 3% chance, right? So it’s at 3%. Then we won Utah. Remember, we were supposed to lose Utah. We only won by 22 points. Very accurate. So we win you Utah.\\nDonald Trump: (33:05)\\nSo it goes 3%, 5%, 8%, 12%, 21%. Now they’re saying, “Man, that sucker. That number is getting bad up there, that little number.” Then it started getting smaller, because they made the numbers small, but the number was actually getting bigger. 21%, 25%. Then we won a place called North Carolina. So it went from 25% to 32% right through that evening. Wasn’t that a great evening? Started off with Ohio. Remember, “You cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.” I heard that for a year. And then we won Ohio by 8.7. So everyone said, “Nobody wins it by eight.” By the way, we’re doing better there now that we did four years ago. The great Jim Jordan and all those guys. So we won by eight points and that was the beginning. They said, “Wait a minute. Not only did he win, he won by a lot.” But that was the little signal as to what was happening.\\nDonald Trump: (34:10)\\nSo then it goes to 25, then 31, 35. Now we hit the 42. So now I have a 42 chance of winning. And I’m looking at all these states and I’m leading in most of them, right? We won 32 or 34 States. So it goes 34, 38, and now they’re going, “Oh, what’s going on here?” And remember the guy, John King at CNN. And he’s good with the board. I like it. He’s got nice action. But it wasn’t so good that night. He was shaking And he’s going, “Okay, well, look, this is not looking good. This is not good. I don’t know.” And now he’s a nervous mess. And he’s going, “What’s going to happen?” Who’s there, Heather? Oh, Hemmer, Bill Hemmer. Well, Bill Hemmer’s a good guy, right? Bill Hemmer’s a good guy. Oh, he said, “Hemmer’s better.” I agree with that. Hemmer’s a good guy.\\nDonald Trump: (35:06)\\nBut you know what? It’s very interesting. So then we go from 42 to 48, 54, 60, 64, then 71. This is in our favor. Then 78. Then you see all the people screaming and crying. It was beautiful. The most beautiful convention center. They had that. Remember they had the earth that was shaped like the United States. And they had the podium on the state of Florida out there hanging out over. And I looked, I said, I said to our great First Lady, I said, “First Lady, that is the most beautiful looking thing I’ve ever seen.” The way they had it. They spent a fortune. But they knew something was wrong because they went to Grucci, and they were in the river at the convention center, and they had a big display of 4th of July, whatever the hell it is, the fireworks. And they paid a lot of money. But now they had to pay seven million. They owed $7 million to Grucci and they were all set to do it. And then they decided to cancel.\\nDonald Trump: (36:10)\\nSo I then called up Grucci. I said, “Listen, it’s way far away from my location, but I’ll give you a million dollars.” I tried to buy their fireworks. I figured I’d give New York, have a little fun. But I’ll never forget that beautiful. And it looked so beautiful. Five o’clock, it’s beautiful. They’re all looking like, oh, they’re going to have a big evening. And by eight o’clock in the evening, you watch these people. Remember the woman screaming, you know the one? Screaming. How about her? You think she’s a reasonable person to deal with? And she was screaming, they’re screaming. And they talked about the glass ceiling, right? The woman breaking the glass ceiling. And it didn’t work out that way. The glass ceiling broke her. But there will be a woman that breaks the glass ceiling. It just won’t be Hillary.\\nDonald Trump: (36:58)\\nAnd you know what else it won’t be? It won’t be Kamala. Won’t be. It won’t be Kamala. But we worry about her. I’m very concerned about her, because as you probably just heard just before I walked out, two of the people that traveled with her, her chief of staff and somebody else in the plane with her all the time, they have been tested positive for COVID- 19. So we extend our best wishes, right? Right? Yes? We extend our best wishes. We extend our best, which is more than they did to me. But that’s okay. That’s okay. So let’s see what happens. I mean, it’s a tricky thing. It’s dust. It’s a little tricky thing. Masks, no masks, everything, you can do all you want. But you still need help from the boss. You need help from the boss. That’s what happened. We needed help. Yeah, we needed help. It’s all right to say.\\nDonald Trump: (38:14)\\nNow, they’ll criticize me for that. “How dare he say that. How dare he say that.” No, I’ll say it. I’ll say it. I’ll say it. Somebody said to me the other day, “You’re the most famous person in the world by far.” I said, “No, I’m not. No, I’m not.” They said, “Yes, you are. I said, “No.” They said, “Who’s more famous?” I said, “Jesus Christ.” I’m not taking any chances. I’m not going to have it. Hey, I’m not having any arguments. Jesus Christ. I’m not going to take any chances, I guarantee. And let me look up and I’ll say and it’s not even close. To defend our Constitution, I proudly nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. It’s been so popular. A lot of people said I got elected because of the United States Supreme Court. I don’t know that it’s true. But when I ran, people knew who I was and all, but they didn’t know too much about my politics. And they figured maybe I’m liberal. Who knows? They didn’t.\\nDonald Trump: (39:29)\\nAnd they weren’t happy because they didn’t know who I was going to appoint as a Supreme Court Justice. Was I going to put a radical left person, like he will put? He’s got to give a list, by the way. Not only can he not pack the court, which would be horrible, horrible for our country, for that institution, but he’s got to give a list of 10, 12, 15, 20, 25 that he will only pick from, because people have to be able to see who he is going to pick. You can’t let somebody go up and put a crazy radical left justice in the Supreme Court. So I’m going a step further than them. They don’t press him much. How about if I said what he said? He said, “No, no, I’m not going to say. I’ll tell them after the election.” Oh, that’s great. That’s wonderful. And then these guys walk away. No, no, he’s got to say about packing the court, but he’s also got to say who from what group will he pick?\\nDonald Trump: (40:24)\\nGive the names because you have to know that. You have to know that. And they say that’s what won me the election. I don’t know if it’s true, but a lot of people say because I came up, and I was having a lot of, when I first went, had a lot of bike back, where people were saying, “Well, wait a minute. Who’s he going to pick as a Supreme Court Judge?” And I said to my people, who are some really great people, I said, “Give me the top 25.” It was 20, and then ultimately expanded to 25 judges, lawyers, group of people. “Give me the top 25 judges, et cetera, in the United States. I want the smartest, the best, the most brilliant, and I’m going to put them in a list.” And I didn’t know, I don’t think, almost any of them, but these are the most respected people. They believe in a thing called the Constitution, which Biden’s people won’t believe in. You’ll see some real beauties if they put in the truth. That’s why they don’t want to do that, because you couldn’t win an election if you had to do that.\\nDonald Trump: (41:29)\\nSo I said, “Give me the top 25,” and then I went out and I played a little bit cute. I said, “All right, I will pick somebody like these people.” And you know what, that didn’t play. They said, “No, you have to pick one of these people, two of these.” And that’s what I did. I said, “All I’ll do that.” And they say that was 20 or 25 points in terms of the percentages of what I got. It was a big thing on the United States Supreme Court. Well, I’ve done it again. I’ve now taken my original list and we had two great people put, as you-\\nDonald Trump: (42:03)\\n… original list. And we had two great people put as you know, Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch. And by the way, nobody’s ever suffered like Justice Kavanaugh, what he went through, nobody. But we put Justice, Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch. They’re fantastic intellects, fantastic people. And now we have Amy to go along with it and it’s going to be unbelievable. Another week they’ll be voting. The full Senate will be voting. And I don’t know what can stop it because she’s so good. It’s a freight train, okay. But the fact is, so we’ll have three, but you know what Joe Biden has to tell you who. Because the next president, whoever it may be, it better be us, because if it’s not, honestly, you will not have the same country because the next president, the next term will have anywhere from one, two, three, and even four picks, very unusual.\\nDonald Trump: (43:04)\\nI was very unusual at three. It’s a record for a term, but you know what? The next could have just by statistically one, two, three, or four. So your whole court as good as we’re doing now, and if I didn’t do this, you wouldn’t even have a 2nd Amendment. You wouldn’t have a 2nd Amendment, but if they put on two, three or four, that means they will override. And that’s good for 30, 40, 50 years. And the judges, they go in young and they last for a long time, which is nice. So Biden has to go out and he has to not only talk about not packing the court because anybody who wants to pack the court shouldn’t win. And Justice Ginsburg said that. She said, “No, the nine, we’re friendly, we get together. We’re for the country.”\\nDonald Trump: (43:53)\\nShe made the greatest case for nine. Once you get a big group of people, then you’re into the Senate, you’re into the House. We’ve already got that, right. And this is a great institution, maybe our greatest institution, and we can’t let some radical group of people destroy it. So number one, he can’t pack the court. And number two, he’s got to explain one of 25 or 30 or 40 or 50 people, but he’s got to put up a list of people from which he’ll choose. And the voters have to know who those people are and he can’t get away with I’ll tell you after the election and then destroy our country. He can’t do it. So that’s it. That’s it.\\nDonald Trump: (44:39)\\nThat’s much more interesting than going off a teleprompter when you think of that, but no, but you got to say it. You got to say it like it is. So Bidens’ agenda would be a catastrophe for North Carolina seniors and you know that better than anybody. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. People don’t know that about him, but he tried to cut your Social Security, great genius. He’s going to cut your Social Security and your Medicare. Now Biden’s pledging mass amnesty and free healthcare for illegal aliens. And you saw that three months ago when he’s on stage and he said to all of these very radical left candidates, “Who wants to give illegal aliens free healthcare?” And they all raise their hand and Biden didn’t and then you could see his right shoulder here it was the corpse. I say he’s the corpse. And his shoulder was… He was looking around, he didn’t know what the hell was happening, but he knew everyone else’s hand was up.\\nDonald Trump: (45:39)\\nRemember that though? He knew it was wrong. Look, he’s been there for 47 years, hasn’t done a damn thing. He’s been there 40… He knew it was wrong, but his right shoulder started moving. And I said, “I just won the election.” I said, “Isn’t that nice?” And you know what? We all have a heart, but what that does is it brings millions of people into our country. They all want to get health care. They want to get education. They want to get all the things that they want to give them and you can’t do it. You can’t afford it, but that’s what they want So we’re not going to let that happen because it’ll decimate Medicare and destroy your Social Security and everything else. While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare or your Social Security.\\nDonald Trump: (46:23)\\nAnd under my leadership, we’re developing the vaccines and therapies and all of those things and you vote for me, prosperity is happening. Already it’s happening. It’s happening so fast nobody can believe it. We’re the number one country in the world by far for economic comeback and we went down less than any other country. Think of that. Normal life, that’s what we want. We want normal. I don’t want to talk. We want normal. We want to get back to where we were nine months ago, eight months ago. We want to have those football stadiums, those great teams of yours, we want to have people sitting next to each other screaming like crazy. You look at the stands where you have a person and then 20 empty seats. Nah, that’s not it. And we’ll be back. We’re going to be back very soon. Next year will be maybe the greatest economic year, one of the greatest economic years, but maybe the greatest economic year. I think better than last year. Last year was your best. I think we’re going to do better.\\nDonald Trump: (47:20)\\nAnd to a large extent, this election’s about many things, but it’s between a Trump recovery and a Biden depression. Because if they get in, they’re going to raise your taxes quadruple. He says it. They’re going to allow millions of illegal aliens in, and they’re going to let regulations, all of the cutting that I’ve done in regulation, which is a number that no president has ever even come close to, whether they were four, eight, or in one case, more than that. They’re going to let all those regulations come back in. And the farmers know what I’m talking about and the tobacco growers know what I’m talking about because you couldn’t even farm your land. You had so many regulations. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate North Carolina’s economy with draconian, unscientific lock downs. He’ll keep you locked down except at a level that you’ve never seen before. You won’t have a state by the time this guy finishes up. Biden’s plan will crush America. My plan is already crushing the virus.\\nDonald Trump: (48:26)\\nLook at our numbers, look at our numbers. This week, oh dammit. He must have lost his job. He must’ve been a nice guy. I’m sure he lost his job. This week, even the failing New York Times, the poor writer, I read this and I said, “This guy is gone, but I didn’t know him so what the heck.” The New York Times said that, this is the quote, experts are saying, “With genuine confidence that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than anybody ever expected.” How about that? New York Times. That’s right. The writer of that article is gone now, but may he rest in peace.\\nDonald Trump: (49:17)\\nThey don’t want to say that. They’re not happy to hear that because they don’t really have our interest at heart. Our early and aggressive action save so many lives, millions of lives. We pioneered all of these incredible therapies and reduced the fatality rate 80, think of it, 85%. We understand the disease and we have things that work and I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received available to anybody that wants it that has a problem free. And it’s free because it wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t your fault and I only hope it works as well on you, but I’ll tell you, I felt like Superman a day later. Here I am. Here I am.\\nDonald Trump: (50:07)\\nI actually looked at the doctor. He’s here with us now. Great doctors. We had so many doctors. I never saw so many doctors, all geniuses, lowest IQ 187. And they weren’t thrilled. But I looked at them and said, “I don’t know what the hell you gave me, but I want some more of it.” No, it was a transfusion. And it was amazing so we’re going to make that available to everybody. We’re trying to get it immediately approved by the FDA. And Dr. Han is working at the FDA to get it. And hopefully you don’t need it. And for the most part, you won’t need it. I think for the most part, but you need it. We’re going to get it to you, and you’re going to get it and you’re going to get better. And I call it a cure. They call it a therapeutic. I called it a cure, Regeneron.\\nDonald Trump: (50:52)\\nAnd they have others that are very similar, great companies. I told you before, Eli Lilly, et cetera. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year. The vaccine will end the pandemic but it’s ending anyway. I mean, they go crazy when I say it. It’s going to peter out and it’s going to end, but we’re going to help the end and we’re going to make it a lot faster with the vaccine and with the therapeutics and frankly, with the cures. So we’re joined today by some incredible warriors and friends of ours, Congressman David Rouzer, where is he? David. David Rouzer. There’s our warrior. How are we doing David? We’re doing okay in this state? You’re doing good. Do you have any competition in the race? Any competition or not much?\\nDavid Rouzer: (51:38)\\nNot much.\\nDonald Trump: (51:39)\\nI love that. I like when they say, “Not much, sir,” but if they have, I’m always there to help, right. I’m there to help. Thank you, David. Great job. We have a candidate for North Carolina, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Catherine Truitt. Catherine. Great. Great. Thank you. Good job, Catherine. I heard that. Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, who just recovered herself by the way. For anybody that’s sitting, look, they’re all jumping. Oh, she just recovered. Let’s get the hell out of here. No, Ronna’s great. Where is Ronna? Right here. Thank you Ronna. She’s great. She did a great job. She ran Michigan for us four years ago. She did so well. And many, many decades since the Republican won Michigan, and we won Michigan.\\nDonald Trump: (52:33)\\nI said, “I want that person running the RNC. She’s great.” So Ronna, thank you very much. She just fully recovered from COVID. A lot of people are recovering. People are recovering 99%, 99 plus plus. And now with what you can do, one thing I do say, “Get there early. Get to the hospital early. Get there early.” They can do things. Lots of things, but don’t get there late. Get there early. And North Carolina GOP Chairman, a friend of ours, a great gentleman, Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael. Great job. How are we doing? Doing all right? Looking like a good win, right? And are the numbers that big standing online getting ready to vote, right? Bigger than you anticipated? He’s saying the right things. Thank you Michael. No, I hear. It was broadcast today. The numbers are crazy. You know what it’s called? And this is what we’re going to have. We’re going to have a red wave. That’s what they call it.\\nDonald Trump: (53:37)\\nThey don’t want to send in the balance and have the balance thrown away into a dumpster. Who are you for, Trump? Get rid of that one, get rid. This is the craziest thing: they want to vote. Our people want to go and they want to vote. It’s going to be a big, beautiful red wave and let them put in their deal and we’ll check in every one of them. We’re watching very closely where they came from, where they went, how did they get there, right, all this stuff that’s going on. Not a day goes by when you don’t read about what crooked thing is happening, but the red wave will crush it. And those are people that are going to get there on November 3rd and previous to that, the open voting when you can vote, but they’re going to get there and people are talking about it already and you’re seeing that aren’t you? Huh? You’re seeing that. That’s great Michael. That’s great. It’s going to be a lot of fun because there was a landslide. Well, we’re going to see. We’re going to see, but we got a good shot.\\nDonald Trump: (54:35)\\nNo, we’re doing great in Pennsylvania. We’re doing great in Michigan. Doing great in Arizona. I heard some very good numbers just now in Nevada. We’re doing good. I mean, we’re doing good all over the place. And I don’t want to say it too loud because they get all this money. They’ll spend money like crazy, but ultimately, money doesn’t get you there because I spent 25% of what Crooked Hillary spent, right. I spent 25%. And even after I won, they said, “He didn’t do as good a job at fundraising.” I said, “I spent less money and I got criticized that we won.” My father taught me a long time ago if you can win for less money, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing, right? Good thing. Right Michael? Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now we are doing it again. In my first three years, family income increased by $6, 000, more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. Think of that.\\nDonald Trump: (55:40)\\nSo we did really more than eight times. African American income grew nine times more than it did under Biden and Obama, nine times. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment all reached in history, record highs. Highest in history, and we’re getting them all back. They’re all coming back. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty. Since the China virus, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs. We have never produced jobs at that level and that speed. We’ve already cut the unemployment rate in half and think of it, 7.8 7.9. That sounds terrible. But it sounds pretty good when they’re telling you about the 42%, right? Because I figured 42, what are you going to do? We have this crazy situation that happened and 7.8%, it’s a pretty incredible when you think about it and we’ll get that way down and it’s going down fast. Well, yeah, just watch this. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost in their crisis. It wasn’t a crisis though.\\nDonald Trump: (57:04)\\nIt was not great times, but it wasn’t a crisis. We did it in five months. So they had 30 months and they had the weakest recovery in the history of our country dating back actually to when they started 1929. It was the weakest recovery in the history of our country and then he wants to tell us how to do things. For 47 years, he did nothing. I love these guys. For 47 years he did nothing, now all of a sudden he wants to do all these things that I did already. I could do better. You shouldn’t have let China in. Well, for two months he was saying I was xenophobic because I closed the borders very early didn’t I, huh? Jobs have been recovering 23 times faster than the Obama Biden recovery. 23 times. Not 23%, 23 times. And these numbers come from the great Larry Kudlow, who’s a good man by the way. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over us for 47 years. Think of it. Biden has waged the decades-long assault on your state against your state’s tobacco growers.\\nDonald Trump: (58:15)\\nHe was a cheerleader for NAFTA, which was a disaster, TPP, which would have been a disaster had I not terminated. It would have destroyed your state. It would have destroyed manufacturing in our country and he was totally in favor of China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. That’s when they took off like a rocket, but not so good anymore. For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of North Carolina workers. He should not be asking for your votes, he should be begging for your forgiveness. That’s what he should be doing. What a job he did. I mean, you go back four or five years, you people were hurting. You were hurting. I have plenty of friends in this state. You were hurting. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders, countries you never heard of. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA.\\nSpeaker 2: (59:23)\\nUSA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.\\nDonald Trump: (59:23)\\nThat’s probably the main reason I ran in the first place. And I made this statement the other day and it sort of made sense to me. If Obama and Biden did a good job, I would have never run. I mean, think. I only ran because they did a horrible job and there was no unity. You had Ferguson. Look at what happened in St. Louis. Look at what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened in Oakland. Look at what happened. There was hatred all over the place. Now they say, “Oh, wasn’t that beautiful.” What they did was they did a terrible job. That’s why I’m your president. Because if they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. I had a very nice life, believe me. And by the way, how many of these rallies have you? Stand up, please. North Carolina. What number is this? Don’t be embarrassed.\\nSpeaker 3: (01:00:27)\\n60.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00:27)\\nSix O?\\nSpeaker 3: (01:00:28)\\n60 times.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00:29)\\n60. They have a group of 12 women and I see them a lot. And I say, “North Carolina, they remind me of that no matter where we go.” And so 60, that’s a lot, but that’s only about 20%. So you have a long way to… I’m sure their husbands are thrilled. Where are you going? I’m going to, well, at least here you’re close, right?\\nSpeaker 4: (01:00:55)\\n1,000%.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00:57)\\nAnd you don’t mind, right?\\nSpeaker 4: (01:00:58)\\nNo.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00:59)\\nWe like him. We like him. Great women. Thank you very much. That’s really nice. Now, that’s really nice. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration’s Trans-Pacific Partnership. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA, which is just now kicking in and it’s turned out to be incredible for our farmers, our manufacturers. Everyone said it couldn’t be done. There’s no way you could end NAFTA. I ended it. It was one of the worst trade deals ever made. I took the toughest ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. We’ve achieved energy independence, and we’ve done it while protecting our pristine environment. We have the best environmental numbers we’ve ever had, meaning I guess over 50 years because before that you didn’t have too much action, right?\\nDonald Trump: (01:01:53)\\nBut we have the best environmental numbers, ozone numbers, so many other numbers. In the meantime, China, Russia, India, all these countries, they’re spewing stuff into the air. I keep telling our people. I say, “I love clean air, but Russia and China,” you look at a map. You have all these spots and India and many others are spewing it in. What do you suggest? Well, we don’t think you should sell straws anymore. Oh, great. Okay. That’s going to help. You ever hear that? The straw, right? And I say, “Okay, the straw is good. That’s a little straw. That’s okay. What about the plastic plate? What about the carton? What about the glass that’s out of plastic?” Well, we’ll get to that later. These people are crazy. I recently signed an order placing a moratorium on offshore drilling off the coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. So you don’t have to worry about any oil spills in your beautiful land. You don’t have to worry. Look how happy she is. She obviously lives on the water. You don’t have to worry about those spills. At the same time, I have made it…\\nDonald Trump: (01:03:03)\\nI don’t have to worry about those spills. At the same time, I have made it so great for energy. We’ve never had energy like we do. We’re number one in the world now by far, and totally energy independent. In 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American.\\nDonald Trump: (01:03:24)\\nI saw a Biden the other day. He’s standing here like this. And he’s got a sign, “Hire American.” I said, “I’ve been saying that for 15 years.” It’s amazing. And you know this one, when the Tennessee Valley Authority replaced part of its American workforce with foreign workers, I told the board chairman, “Chairman, you’re fired. Out. You’re fired, chairman.” You know what he was making? This had nothing to do with me. He was making $8 million a year. He’s the highest paid government official. Semi-government. It’s like a private, semi-private deal. $8 million a year. And I said, “You’re fired.” And what happened is, as soon as I said that they hired all the employees back from Tennessee and five other states, six other states. Mississippi\\nDonald Trump: (01:04:17)\\nThey’re all back, and they were great. They were great. So we do our little things, right? We did that one and it was great. My opponent’s immigration plan is the most extreme in the history of our country. Biden’s plan would eliminate US borders by implementing nationwide catch and release. That’s catch… A murderer comes over, you catch him. What do you do? Well, not much. Most of them don’t say they killed people. You catch them, you take their name, and you release them into our country. It was a big deal. It sounds easy. I ended it. But you want to see tough? Go through courts, goes through… But I ended it. I ended catch and release.\\nDonald Trump: (01:04:57)\\nOne of the worst things. Now we release them. You know where we release them? We release them back into their country. We don’t release them into our country anymore. We say, “Congratulations, we’ve got them.” Look at all those people standing up out there. Wow, sorry. Sorry we didn’t get you seats. Well, they’re strong. They’re strong people. They’re from North Carolina. Making every community into a sanctuary city, this is their goal. And suspending all removals of any illegal alien, no matter how bad they are. Murderers, rapists. They have a deal with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. He lost twice. Greatest loser of all time. He lost the first time and he took it, then he lost the second time. Elizabeth Warren should have dropped out, I’d be running against him. That would be okay. I don’t care. There’d be more energy. Smaller base, more energy.\\nDonald Trump: (01:05:47)\\nBut it happened twice to Bernie. But I would really be watching it very careful because it would be the total nullification of US borders. They don’t want borders. They want to have this country, and what would happen would be our country would be overwhelmed with illegal immigration coming in. Your jobs, crime would go through the roof. And now, as I said, we have the strongest southern border in the history of our country. Over 400 miles of wall.\\nDonald Trump: (01:06:17)\\nWall will be completed very soon. MS-13 and criminal cartels would have rampaged freely all over the country if it wasn’t for ICE and border patrol, so we’ve gotten rid of thousands of MS013. We delivered them back out of our country. We said, “Congratulations. Here they are. You take them. We’re not taking them.” These are some bad people. If Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone, and your safety is gone. It’s very simple. Biden has pledged with Bernie Sanders, they made agreement. You know what it is? They all agreed to a thing. We call it the manifesto. My idea. It’s called the manifesto.\\nDonald Trump: (01:07:05)\\nHe’s pledged to eliminate our requirement that newcomers to our society be financially self-reliant. We want them to be able to make a pledge that they’re not going to take from us, and he’ll provide unlimited welfare, he wants to, for anybody anywhere in the world that comes into our country. I said, “That’s a great idea. Where are we going to get the money, Sleepy Joe?” Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we’re finishing the wall. We’re up to now 407, I think. 406, 407. We’re doing 10 miles a week. Nobody believes it. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US Military. Defense spending in North Carolina has soared to more than $1 billion a year, many times what it was. And by the way, all made in the USA. We have the greatest machinery ever made by any nation in history. Russia, China, every one of them. They’re all jealous. What we have is not even to be talked about.\\nDonald Trump: (01:08:16)\\nI actually mentioned this in a rally about two months ago and they said, “He’s giving away information.” Now I’m not. I’m telling you something. We’ve got stuff that they dream about, all made in the USA. $2.5 trillion. And you know what? Hope to God… We’ve redone our nuclear. When number one in the world by far. It was going down the tubes. It was old and tired, but hope to God we never have to use it. Remember when I came in? They said, “With his personality, we’ll be in a war in the first week.” Where’s the war? Where’s the way? Remember? You would’ve have been in a war without me, because North Korea, we were going to have a nice nuclear war with North Korea. And now I get along great with him. And everyone says, “Oh, that’s terrible” that I get along. No, it’s a good thing. Getting along is a good thing, not a bad thing. And you get along through strength, not through weakness. You never get along through weakness.\\nDonald Trump: (01:09:10)\\nAnd we launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces, and I never even talked. When I came to North Carolina and talked to you, I never said this. So we actually did more than I promised. I’m the only politician, if you’d call me that. I’m the only politician that actually did more than I promised, because I never talked about the Space Force. I never talked about it, right? And as I sat for a year and I watched and I saw what was going on with Russia and with China and with others, I said, “Wait a minute, we’re going to fall away behind. We can’t do that.” And we launched the Space Force. And Jim Inhofe and some of the people in the Senate were fantastic, and the House. And we got it passed, so we have… First time in 75 years, think of that, a new force. And it’s a big force, and it’s an important one. We passed VA Choice for our veterans and VA Accountability for our veterans. Nobody thought that could happen. 42 years.\\nDonald Trump: (01:10:10)\\nAnd we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate. When I came in, it was a mess. They were all over the place. We took over 100% and we killed the leader of ISIS and founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were after him for 15 years. And we took out the world’s number one terrorist, the mass murder of many American troops and many other troops and many other people, Kasseem Salamoni is dead. And I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous $150 billion plus $1.8 billion in cash. Can you believe it? Five plane loads of cash. Figure that one. The Iran nuclear deal, a disaster. And you know the first call I’m going to get after we win? It’s going to be from Iran. “Can we make a deal?” Because their country’s going to hell with the sanctions and all of the things we’ve done, and they want to make a deal.\\nDonald Trump: (01:11:09)\\nI said, “Why don’t you wait till after the election?” I said, “But if you wait until after the election, it is going to be much tougher.” But I said, “Wait until after the election,” because you can’t make a deal now. You’ve going to see if sleepy Joe… Because if sleepy Joe gets in you’ll make the greatest deal ever made. And China will own us. Remember what I said. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Got it built. And we got it built, Mr. Congressman. We got it built.\\nDonald Trump: (01:11:49)\\nThey wanted $2 billion to build it. I said, “Maybe we could do cheaper.” I said to my people, I said, “You know this story. Find something. Maybe we own some land.” We did. It had a building on it. So we were going to spend $2 billion. I said, “Well, let’s renovate the existing building. Is it big enough?” “Oh, it’s too big, actually.” “And how’s the location?” “Much better than the one we were going to buy in Jerusalem.” I said, “Alright, come back with a price.” David Friedman, who’s one of the most successful lawyers. Now he’s the ambassador to Israel. So he calls me up two days later, he says, “Sir, I think we can do it for $350,000.”\\nDonald Trump: (01:12:23)\\nI said, “David.” From $2 billion. I said, “Well, what’s the difference between the $2 billion version and the $350,000?” He said, “Sir, honestly the $350,000 will have a better location, a better building. It’s actually better.” Now, who would believe stories like this? And I actually told him, I did something I don’t think, congressman, I’ve ever done in my life. I said, “David, it’s too cheap. It doesn’t sound good. Make it more expensive, please.” So we made it $500,000. Not bad, right? And we opened it up a few months later. So not only did we name Jerusalem, became the capital of Israel. We got the building built. This thing would’ve taken 10 years, 20 years. Would’ve cost $5 billion. It would have been ridiculous. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, they’ve been fighting over that for 52 years.\\nDonald Trump: (01:13:16)\\nAnd instead of endless wars, we’re forging peace in the Middle-East. I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. It’s true. And now he’s pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy your social security, and he would destroy all preexisting conditions. And you know it, and so does he. Biden’s running mate sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have 180 million people that love their private healthcare. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions. He’s agreed to this with crazy Bernie, by 700%. Think of that. Does that sound reasonable? Opening the flood Gates to radical Islamic terrorism. I said, “No, thank you.” He wants to ban school choice and charter schools. And in a second term, and I’ve already started, we will provide school choice to every parent in America. One of the most important things.\\nDonald Trump: (01:14:27)\\nA vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and limitless future. A limitless future for all Americans. And just in concluding, first of all it’s great to be with you on this gorgeous day. This is beautiful. Been a great state. My granddaughter, you what happened, right? You know the name of my granddaughter? Carolina. Carolina. Am I allowed to say that to South Carolina? Because I love them too. Can I maybe do a… Am okay with that? Can I have your approval? It’s Carolina. Beautiful. Over the next four years, we’ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we’ll end our reliance on China. We’ve already started, we’re well on our way. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms.\\nDonald Trump: (01:15:45)\\nWe will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous, foolish, stupid foreign wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. Already signed, hits in January 1st. Don’t give Biden the credit for it, please. He won’t even know what it is. He’ll say, “What did I do?” And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs at levels that you’ve never seen before. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon in the United States. We’ll be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and it’ll be soon. And NASA is now the number one space center in the world by far. And it was virtually abandoned when I took over. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools.\\nDonald Trump: (01:17:13)\\nWe will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” And that won’t be changed. They took the word God out of the pledge of allegiance and they got absolutely decimated. They put it back. They said, “No, no we didn’t it.” And then they took it out a couple of other times. That’s the way they’re going, but it’s not going to happen. Not even going to come close. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina.\\nDonald Trump: (01:18:12)\\nSo again, this is the most important election of our lives, maybe in the history of our country. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get out and vote. The red wave is coming. The red wave is coming. And remember, early voting starts, guess when? Today. So go down there. From Wilmington to Winston-Salem, from Asheville to Charlotte, from Greensboro to right here in Greenville, we inherit the legacy of North Carolina patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We love our nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And you haven’t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, and we are returning it faster than anyone ever thought possible.\\nDonald Trump: (01:19:57)\\nWith your help, your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We’re proud. We will make America safe again, quickly. And we will make America great again. Thank you everybody. Go out and vote.  Greenville, North Carolina   Campaign Speech    1\n",
       "            Mike Pence             Mike Pence Campaign Speech Miami Transcript October 15                                                                                     Pedro Fuentes Cid: (01:08)\\nYeah, my name is Pedro Fuentes Cid. I’m a Cuban ex-political prisoner, and I have here with me Nelly Rojas from [foreign language 00:01:17]. [inaudible 00:01:22] Alvarez [foreign language 00:01:24] Alfredo [inaudible 00:01:33] [foreign language 00:01:38]. First, we want to thank Vice President Pence for allowing us the honor of being here with you. We think that you were one of the wisest decisions that our very wise precedent, Donald Trump, had, and we really are very happy. And not only are we going to make America great again, America is great again because of you guys. It’s great again, and it’s going to continue to be great again. And if you will vote four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Exactly. I want to direct this thought to other ex-political prisoners of communist countries. Watch out communist countries, we don’t want our country to be communist, right? We don’t need it.\\nPedro Fuentes Cid: (02:38)\\nAnyway, to really, really be behind these candidates that have so much in these four years to make this country great, they have done a lot, and they’re going to do even more. And this year, with a [foreign language 00:02:58], they have shown strength. And Kamala [foreign language 00:03:04] Kamala had a discussion with the vice president, vice president was fantastic. I think he beat her to… finish her off. So, anyway, my last words are going to be in Spanish. Sorry about that. [foreign language 00:03: 25] Mike Pence [foreign language 00:03:34] Trump/Pence. Trump/Pence. Trump/Pence. [foreign language 00: 04:27].\\nMike Pence: (04:35)\\nThank you so much.\\nPedro Fuentes Cid: (05:12)\\nYes, sir.\\nMike Pence: (05:16)\\nI’ll give it to the president today.\\nPedro Fuentes Cid: (05:49)\\nAbsolutely. Thank you very much.\\nMike Pence: (06:02)\\nWell, hello Florida. To Lieutenant Governor Nunez, Maria Salazar, Ernesto Ackerman, Bobby [inaudible 00:06:17], all the inspiring three or fighters gathered here today, It is great to be back in the Sunshine State with so many champions for freedom, just 19 days away from a great victory all across Florida and all across America. But standing here, near the hallowed grounds of Memorial Cubano, it is my great honor, on behalf of our president, to accept the endorsement of these extraordinary heroes of the Cuban exiled community. Thank you so much. I thank you so much for the honor and for the support. But honestly, I’m here for one reason and one reason only, and that is that Florida and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Cuatro anos mas. It’s on, and the road to victory runs right through Florida.\\nMike Pence: (07:40)\\nFour years ago, a movement was born, a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. Here in Florida, you knew we could be strong again. You knew we could be prosperous again. You said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016, and I know that Florida is going to say yes to Florida resident President Donald Trump in 2020. But it really is great to be with all of you and great to be back in Miami. And it’s great to be here with some people I so deeply admire. Would you join me in thanking one of the great great leaders in this state and one of the most admired women in America, Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nunez? Thank you so much. And it’s also great to be here with an award-winning journalist, the daughter of Cuban exiles, someone who’s been a voice for the voiceless all across this hemisphere, and the next Congresswoman from Florida’s 27th Congressional District, let’s hear it from Maria Salazar. We need Maria in Washington DC, and while you’re at it, we need you to send Mayor Carlos Jimenez and the great Mario Diaz-Belart to Washington DC, as well.\\nMike Pence: (09:20)\\nSo, it really is great to be with all of you. President will be in Miami before the day is over, so we are doubling up on South Florida. But it’s been a busy time. Been traveling around the country. I was in Utah last week. We had a little debate with Kamala Harris. Some people think I did all right. Thank you. But let me be clear, that debate was not just a debate between two candidates for vice president, it was really a debate between two visions: our vision that leads America to freedom, prosperity, and opportunity for all, and their vision that sets America on a path of less opportunity, decline, and a socialist future. When you compare the Biden/Harris agenda with our agenda, the choice is clear. If you cherish faith and freedom and law and order and life, in less than three weeks, we need to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. Cuatro anos mas.\\nMike Pence: (10:54)\\nIt’s amazing to think how far we’ve come in four years in our stand for freedom, and it all begins with the defense of freedom. Providing for the national defense is the first order of our national government. And I have to tell you, as the proud father of a United States marine and the father-in-law of a United States Navy pilot, currently deployed, I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. President Donald Trump has signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We’ve rebuilt our military, we’ve restored the arsenal democracy, and we’re once again giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guard, the resources and the support that they need. And with that renewed American strength, we’ve stood with our allies and stood up to our enemies, and this president has stood strong for freedom and liberty across this hemisphere of freedom.\\nMike Pence: (12:10)\\nFrom early on, we’ve stood strong with the freedom-loving people of Columbia, with President Duque, and last month, when a great hero of freedom, former president of Alvaro Uribe was placed in house arrest, President Trump and our administration called on the Colombian judiciary to release this heroic champion of freedom. And earlier this week, we learned that President Uribe is free. And in Nicaragua, we’ve stood strong against Ortega’s regime’s brutalization of its citizens and its systemic and lethal attacks against the Catholic church. We’ve imposed sanctions on all of those who would carry out this abuse. And I promise you under president Donald Trump, we are going to continue to stand firm for free and fair elections in 2021 in Nicaragua.\\nMike Pence: (13:22)\\nAnd in Venezuela, under president Donald Trump, America has stood against dictatorship and oppression. We have made it clear to this hemisphere and clear to the world. Maduro must go and democracy must be restored. We’ve imposed sanctions on the dictator Maduro, we’ve deployed Navy and Coast Guard ships into the region to interdict in their narcotics traffic. In this past March, we indicted the dictator Maduro and his cronies for their narco-terrorism corruption and drug trafficking. And I couldn’t be more proud that America was the first nation on earth to recognize president Juan Guaidó as the only legitimate president of Venezuela, and now 60 nations around the world have joined us. You know, it’s heartbreaking to think, socialist policies of the Chavez and Maduro regime have caused economic and humanitarian catastrophe in Venezuela, but under president Donald Trump, as I told Juan Guaidó just a few short weeks ago, in America we say to the people of Venezuela, [foreign language 00:01:53] We will not stand by while Venezuela crumbles. We will stand with the people of Venezuela until their birthright of libertad is restored.\\nMike Pence: (15:09)\\nAnd here, so close to the hallowed ground of Memorial Cubano, erected to remember the victims of the communist regime in Havana, you all know that when Joe Biden was Vice President America appeased the Castro regime with concession after concession. The Obama-Biden administration actually returned a convicted murderer, Gerardo Hernández, and other members of the regime spy network back to Cuba. And when the last president visited Cuba, he literally stood hand in hand with Raul Castro.\\nMike Pence: (15:54)\\nPresident Trump, he brought eight years of appeasement to an end, and President Donald Trump will only stand hand in hand with you and all of those who cherish freedom in this country and in that beleaguered nation. Under this president’s leadership, we’ve reversed the failed policies of the last administration. We’ve imposed sanctions. We’ve stood with political prisoners and stood for the human rights of the Cuban people. As president Trump said just a few weeks ago, when he accepted for the second election in a row the endorsement of the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association, we will not lift sanctions until all political prisoners are freed, freedoms of assembly and expression are respected, and political parties are legalized with free elections for all the people of Cuba. Standing here in the shadow of Memorial Cubano I promise you four more years of president Donald Trump in the white house. It will always be Que Viva Cuba Libre.\\nMike Pence: (17:29)\\nSo we’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve stood for freedom, ours, the birthright of freedom across this hemisphere. And in the first three years of this administration, we revived this economy. Where Joe Biden wants to raise taxes, President Trump cut taxes across the board. We rolled back more federal regulation than any administration in history. We unleashed American energy. We fought for free and fair trade, and in just three short years, businesses large and small created more than seven million good paying jobs, including 550,000 jobs right here in Florida.\\nMike Pence: (18:13)\\nAnd Florida reached its lowest unemployment rate in history. And the average hourly earnings in this state grew faster in our first three years than they did in all eight years when Joe Biden was Vice President. The President and I are probably most proud of the fact that wages were rising across the board, but they were rising most rapidly for hard working blue collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no more.\\nMike Pence: (18:45)\\nAnd all along the way President Trump has stood for the rule of law. We’ve appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And they’re all men and women who will uphold all the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms. And let me just say, 230 judges strong and pretty soon one more on the Supreme Court.\\nMike Pence: (19:24)\\nNone of that would have been possible without the strong support of Senator Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio. Would you join me in thanking these two great leaders? Now last month, we paused as a nation to honor the life in service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But when the memorials were over, President Trump fulfilled his duty under the Constitution, and he nominated a principled, brilliant, conservative woman who loves the Constitution to the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Amy Coney Barrett.\\nMike Pence: (20:04)\\nI’m going to tell her you all did that. I’ll tell you what. Now the President and I called on the Democrats in Washington this time to give Judge Barrett a respectful and dignified confirmation, and we’re going to hold them to it. But we have reason to be concerned. Kamala Harris actually attacked one of our nominees to the federal court because he was a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. And you all remember during Judge Barrett’s confirmation a couple of years ago to the court of appeals, the leading Democrat on the judiciary committee actually said she was concerned, saying that Judge Barrett’s Catholic faith was a quote, “Dogma that lives loudly within you.” And Hollywood elites have already begun to ridicule her faith and family. Well, I got news for the Democrats and their friends in Hollywood. That dogma lives loudly in me. That dogma lives loudly in you and the right to live and work and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States of America.\\nMike Pence: (21:38)\\nSo the Senate has a job to do, and they’re doing it. And after they discharge their duty to advise and consent, I’ll make you a prediction. Judge Amy Coney Barrett is going to be Justice Amy Coney Barrett. We’re going to fill that seat. You know, an independent judiciary is a bulwark of freedom. As we reflect today so much on America’s love and commitment to freedom, people gathered here and all across Florida deserve to know, after 150 years with nine justices on the Supreme Court, leading Democrats in Washington are actually talking about packing the court.\\nMike Pence: (22:46)\\nJoe Biden refused to answer the question during his presidential debate. And you might’ve seen Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris refused to answer my question during our debate. Although in the primaries, Kamala Harris said that she was quote, “Absolutely open,” to packing the court. It’s true. Last Friday, Joe Biden was actually asked if voters didn’t deserve to know if he plans to pack the court. And he said, and I quote, “No, they don’t.” Well, you know what? When you’re running for the highest office in the land, the American people deserve to know whether you’re going to respect the highest court in the land.\\nMike Pence: (23:27)\\nIt’s time for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell to come clean, give the people of this country a straight answer. There’s only one explanation why they won’t answer the question. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to pack the Supreme Court with liberal judges if they win. Make no mistake about it though, adding seats to the Supreme Court and filling them with leftist activist judges would be the biggest power grab in American history, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to preserve an independent judiciary. We’re going to uphold the Constitution of the United States. We’re going to reelect president Donald Trump for four more years.\\nMike Pence: (24:29)\\nSo we’ve stood for the rule of law. We’ve stood for an independent judiciary and conservatives on our court. And President Donald Trump has stood every day with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement. And we always will. The president and I know the men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in this country. When I was growing up my three brothers and I used to travel up to Chicago with mom and dad to visit their families. Dad’s younger brother, still living at home, would come out in the morning wearing that Chicago police department uniform. Sidearms strapped to him. My three brothers and I’d just look up in awe.\\nMike Pence: (25:21)\\nAll of my heroes wear uniforms. Men and women in law enforcement across this country are heroes. And they deserve the respect of every American every day. Now the president and I will always respect the right of Americans to peaceful protest, it’s enshrined in the Constitution. But rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech. Violence against innocent civilians, the destruction of property, or violence against law enforcement will not be tolerated and those who do it will be…\\nMike Pence: (26:03)\\n… will not be tolerated, and those who do it will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\\nMike Pence: (26:12)\\nNow, for months, remember, all summer long, all Joe Biden talked about was peaceful protests, remember? As the American people literally saw businesses and their communities burn on national television. The truth is, Joe Biden would double down on the policies that have led to violence in our major cities. You know, when you withdraw support for those who protect and serve, you only embolden those who would do harm to our families and our communities.\\nMike Pence: (26:46)\\nNow, Joe Biden explains it all by saying that America is, in his words, systemically racist. Joe Biden said that police officers in this country have a quote, “Implicit bias against minorities.” When Joe Biden was asked, if he would support cutting funding for law enforcement, he said, “Yes, absolutely.” Under President Donald Trump, I’ll make your promise. We’re going to back to blue and we’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever.\\nMike Pence: (27:24)\\nYou and I know that we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors or any minorities that live within our city. Under President Trump’s leadership. We have done both for three and a half years, and we’re going to support law enforcement and create more jobs, better education opportunities, and more prosperity for our African-Americans and all of our minorities in this country. We’re going to do both, and we’re going to have law and order in every city for every American of every race and creed and collar. So help us God.\\nMike Pence: (28:23)\\nSo we’ve stood for the rule of law. We stood for law and order. From the first day of this administration, this president is also stood strong for the right of every American to live, to work, to worship, according to the dictates of your conscience and your faith. You know, when Joe Biden was vice president, we saw a steady assault on the religious freedom of the American people. It’s true. It was President Trump who restored the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and teachers and religious charities. It was President Donald Trump who ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor, and the Supreme Court made it permanent by a seven to two vote.\\nMike Pence: (29:08)\\nNow, Joe Biden is actually said that he intends to haul those nuns back into federal court. Can you imagine that? I mean, I’m the product of eight years of Catholic education. My love, and my respect for nuns is boundless. Anybody with me?\\nMike Pence: (29:36)\\nSo here you have the Little Sisters of the Poor who have taken a vow of poverty to dedicate their lives to helping the underserved community, and in the Obama Biden administration, they hauled him into federal court to force them to compromise their faith. Joe Biden actually pledged, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, to do it again, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to reelect President Donald Trump because people of faith have no greater champion than President Donald Trump.\\nMike Pence: (30:14)\\nMaybe most important of all is we talk about Liberty. We need to talk about life. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. They want to increase funding to the largest abortion provider in America, and provide taxpayer funding to promote and provide abortion around the world. President Donald Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history.\\nMike Pence: (30:55)\\nSo we’ve rebuilt our military, revived our economy, stood for law and order, liberties and life. None of that would’ve been possible without the strong and consistent support of Florida’s Republican delegation in Congress. That’s why right after you reelect President Donald Trump for four more years, we need Florida to send Maria Salazar, Mayor Carlos Gimenez, Mario Díaz-Balart to a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives and retire Nancy Pelosi once and for all.\\nMike Pence: (31:34)\\nWhen you look at what we were able to accomplish with a Republican house and Republican Senate in those first few years, there’s only one conclusion you can draw, with this president’s and your support here in Florida, in three short years, we made America great again. We did. You said it.\\nMike Pence: (32:11)\\nThen earlier this year, the coronavirus struck from China. But I’m here to tell you, when there were only five cases of coronavirus in the United States, and all of them had come back from overseas, President Trump did what no American president had ever done, he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world.\\nMike Pence: (32:39)\\nJoe Biden called that hysterical. He said it was xenophobic. He actually wrote that it would make things worse if we closed our border to China. But I can tell you as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, President Trump’s actions saved untold American lives, and it bought us time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II.\\nMike Pence: (33:06)\\nIt’s true. We reinvented testing. We’ve done more than 120 million tests so far. We saw to the manufacture and delivery of literally billions of medical supplies to our doctors and nurses and healthcare workers. We’re developing medicines that are literally saving lives around America and we are just a few weeks away, I believe, from having the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine, and having millions of doses for the American people.\\nMike Pence: (33:38)\\nAs I said, the president is going to be in Miami later today, and I’m happy to report, the president, and the first lady, and Baron are all doing great and he is back. Back on the road. Back in the fight.\\nMike Pence: (33:55)\\nBut, let me take this opportunity to say on behalf of the president, and the first family, how moved we all were by the outpouring of concern and prayers for them. But as the president observed, we know it was just an example of the love and the care and the concern that’s shown for every American family that suffered loss or struggled in the midst of this global pandemic.\\nMike Pence: (34:22)\\nIn fact, let’s just take a moment. Can we just show our appreciation for our doctors, our nurses, our first responders, all those in ministry who have come alongside those who’ve struggled and suffered loss over these past eight months? They are heroes all. Heroes all.\\nMike Pence: (34:47)\\nSo we’re making sure our doctors and nurses have everything they need. The American people have the council to slow the spread, just like y’all did here in Florida this summer. We’re going to protect the vulnerable. We’re going to save lives. With Joe Biden talking about shutting down our economy, under President Trump, we’re opening up America again.\\nMike Pence: (35:12)\\nIn the last five months, after losing 22 million jobs as the height of this pandemic, we’ve already seen 11 and a half million Americans go back to work, including more than 630,000 people back on the job right here in Florida.\\nMike Pence: (35:29)\\nSo we’re opening up America and we are opening up America’s schools. We just announced a few weeks back, we’re distributing a hundred million rapid tests to school nurses and administrators all across America, making it impossible that everywhere in this country, we can get our kids back in the classroom where they belong and keep them there safe and sound. So we’ve gone through a time of testing. But in just 19 days, we’re coming to a time for choosing, and the choice and this election has never been clearer. The stakes have never been higher. It’s amazing to think in the middle of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. President Trump, we not only cut taxes across the board for businesses and families, but we’re going to keep cutting taxes for four more years.\\nMike Pence: (36:37)\\nJoe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape. The president had to remind him, in that presidential debate, that he supports the green new deal. It seemed like he forgot. He wants to put us back into the Paris Climate Accord. President Trump, we cut federal red tape, our air and land and water are the cleanest in history, and we’re also a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years.\\nMike Pence: (37:08)\\nWhen it comes to trade, the contrast couldn’t be clearer. When we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China. $500 billion a year we were losing to China. Joe Biden’s been a cheerleader for communist China all along the way. President Trump, he put China on notice. He said, “The era of economic surrender is over.” We imposed tariffs and we’re going to stand strong with China until they respect American workers and American property.\\nMike Pence: (37:52)\\nAnd you all remember NAFTA, signed in 1995. Where I come from up in the Heartland, we literally saw entire communities shuttered as factories closed, as jobs move South of the border and overseas. It’s true. 60,000 factories were closed in all the years since NAFTA. The last administration was about to give up on manufacturing, remember? They said, “What magic wand do you have?” Well, we didn’t need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. NAFTA is gone, the USMCA is here to stay, and it’s a win for Florida. It’s a win for Florida workers and Florida agriculture. It’s amazing.\\nMike Pence: (38:44)\\nThe people of Florida deserved to know that Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, actually was one of only 10 senators to vote against the USMCA. Even though it was a huge win for agriculture in this state, and a huge win for manufacturing. Kamala Harris said, “The USMCA didn’t go far enough on climate change.”\\nMike Pence: (39:02)\\n… USMCA didn’t go far enough on climate change. She actually put her radical environmental agenda ahead of American jobs and Florida jobs. And I promise you, with four more years of President Donald Trump, we’re always going to put American jobs and American workers first. When you look at their agenda, it’s clear. Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left.\\nMike Pence: (39:34)\\nNow, Joe Biden says that democracy is on the ballot, whatever that means. I think our economic recovery is on the ballot. Law and order are on the ballot. I think all the freedom loving people gathered here and your families know that there are things much more foundational and much more fundamental that are on the ballot. In this election, I think it’s not going to be so much whether America ends up more Republican or more Democrat, more conservative or more liberal, more red or more blue. I think the choice in this election is whether America remains American. It’s whether we’re going to allow Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the Democratic party to steer us on a path forged by the radical left toward more government, less freedom, and an inexorable path to socialism, whether we’re going to renew our commitment to all the ideals that have made this country great, of freedom and personal responsibility.\\nMike Pence: (40:53)\\nIt’s a choice so many families in this community understand better than most Americans. Many of your families in generations past actually fled tyrannies, like communist Cuba, socialist Venezuela, come to this land of freedom. You’ve heard tale, and some of you have seen the aftermath of the empty lives of those who would promise a free lunch, who would advance more government and less freedom. You’ve seen the end of the road where the leftist want to take us in America. And you also know the price that the heroes remembered at Memorial Cubana paid to stand for freedom.\\nMike Pence: (41:39)\\nIt’s humbling for me to stand here today with this grand memorial behind me, to think of heroes like Carlos Costa and Mario de la Pena. They were called brothers to the rescue in 1996. They loved freedom so much. They flew missions attempting to locate Cuban refugees who were trying to escape communist tyranny of Castro so they could drop relief supplies on them and radio their position to the coast guard. But you all know the story. Their mission of mercy was cut short when they were shut down over international waters by Cuban fighter jets. They were sons of Cuba. They were patriotic Americans and we rightly honor their memory in name and in deed.\\nMike Pence: (42:43)\\nWe’re inspired by their example, by what they were willing to do to advance the freedom in this nation and in this hemisphere in their time. We know they were driven by love for their families. We know they were driven by a love for freedom. And as a great Cuban American who fled Cuba as a child said at the Republican National Convention, and I quote Maximo said, “Right now, it’s up to us to decide our fate and to choose freedom over oppression.” He said, rightly, “You and I will decide.” But then he said, “Here’s what I’ve decided.” He said, “I choose President Trump because I choose America. I choose President Trump because I choose freedom.” So for our freedom and for our future, we need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States. We’re going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. I want to thank you all for coming out today. And I want to thank you for the honor of serving as your vice president these last four years, the greatest honor in my life. And I’ve served alongside this president every day the last four years. I really didn’t know the Florida resident who became our president until he asked me to join the ticket. Some people think we’re a little different, but actually we’ve gotten to be very close friends. And I can tell you, I can tell you firsthand, there’s not a day gone by that President Trump hasn’t gotten up, turned his face like flint against the wind of unprecedented opposition and fought to keep the promises that he made to the American people. Now it’s our turn to fight for him. It’s on, Florida. We got to make it happen. Going to take all of us.\\nMike Pence: (45:24)\\nSo before I leave, I want to ask you to do a couple of things. First, before these 19 days are out, I need you to vote, Florida. I need you to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. I checked on the way here. Early voting starts Monday, October 19th. And remember, you take advantage of early voting, friends don’t let friends vote alone. Bring a family member, bring a friend, bring a neighbor, and cast a vote for four more years.\\nMike Pence: (46:04)\\nAnd secondly, after you’re done voting, I need you to keep on doing what you’re doing right now. Bring this incredible enthusiasm. Wear the hat, wear the shirt. Tell the story. Tell people, “I ran into Mike the other day out in the field, out on the fairgrounds. And he stood out there for like an hour, just giving us the top lines of everything we’ve been able to accomplish and all that we can do and the choice in this election.” I want you to talk to your neighbors and friends at work and worship every day. And when you do it, I encourage you to have faith. Have faith in the American people. I really do believe that a careful study of American history proves that every time the American people have been given a clear choice between a future built on freedom and a future built on less freedom, they choose freedom every single time. So go tell your neighbors and friends that freedom’s on the ballot on November the third.\\nMike Pence: (47:11)\\nAnd lastly, I’d encourage you to have that other kind of faith as well. At the end of the vice presidential debate, I got a question from a little girl. She said that when she was watching television, it seemed like people arguing all the time, she wondered how we could bring our country back together. But as I’ve traveled across this country these last four years, I’ve become convinced that there will always be more that unites us in these United States than could ever divide us. And chief among those things is faith. It’s true. So if you’re of a mind to bow the head and bend the knee in the next 19 days, I encourage you to do that too.\\nMike Pence: (47:58)\\nAnd when you pray, pray with confidence, mindful of those ancient words, that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray, in turn he’ll do like he’s always done in the long and storied history of this nation. He’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land, this one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America. Pray for all of the American people. It’ll make a difference.\\nMike Pence: (48:49)\\nMen and women of Florida, time’s a wasting. You still got the better part of the rest of the day. Get out and tell the story. And I leave here today encouraged. I just know that if all of us do all that we need to do across the sunshine state and all across this country in every hour that remains between now and election day, we’re going to have a great victory all across Florida and all across America. We’re going to make Florida and America stronger than ever before. We’re going to make Florida and America safer than ever before. We’re going to make Florida and America more prosperous than you could possibly imagine. And with Rick Scott and Marco Rubio in a renewed Republican majority in the Senate, with Maria Salazar, Carlos Gimenez, Mario Diaz-Balart in a new Republican majority in the House with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years and with God’s help, we will make America great again. Again. Thank you all very much. God bless you. God bless America. Let’s go get it done.

       "2020-10-16  David Perdue           Georgia Sen. David Perdue Speech Transcript at Trump Rally: Mocks & Mispronounces Kamala Harris’ Name                                      David Perdue: (00:01)\\nHow great is it to be back in Macon, Georgia with Donald Trump coming to Macon again? I want to thank Governor Kemp because he laid it out just now, but let me remind you of something that happened in 2002. Sunny just mentioned it. Because of you, we turned this thing around, and for the last 18 years, we have built a state that’s now the number one state in the country in which to do business.\\nDavid Perdue: (00:25)\\nThat did not happen by accident. Brian Kemp is the third governor in a row that understands how to do that. And thanks to you, that’s going to continue. Today, we have an opportunity. Every generation has an opportunity like this. They have their moment of crisis. With Donald Trump, it’s all about promises made and promises delivered. After eight years of Joe Biden, you hear Joe lately? Joe said the other day, he said, “Oh yeah, you guys were enjoying that economic Renaissance because of what we did with Barack Obama.”\\nDavid Perdue: (01:06)\\nNow guys, I’m just a dumb business guy for right over that hill, right there, and I can tell you, that is a lie right out of the pit of hell. Donald Trump, after eight years of Barack Obama and Joe Biden giving us the lowest economic output in U.S. history, and we felt that right here in Georgia, Donald Trump gave us the best economic turnaround in U.S. history, y’all.\\nDavid Perdue: (01:36)\\nSeven and a half million new jobs, highest middle class income ever measured, the lowest unemployment for African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanics ever measured. After 800,000 people, under Barack Obama, fell into poverty, under Donald Trump, six and a half million people have lifted themselves out of poverty, y’all. Now that’s America.\\nDavid Perdue: (01:57)\\nBut it took Donald Trump, not the bureaucrats in Washington, not some career politician, but it took Donald Trump to build that wall. It took Donald Trump to move that embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It took Donald Trump to name 200 new federal judges, including Neil Gorsich and Brett Kavanaugh. And next week, we will know that we will confirm Amy Cony Barrett. Mark my words.\\nDavid Perdue: (02:43)\\nIt’s one thing to stand up here and cheer. It’s one thing to stand up and remind everybody. This guy is providential. He didn’t happen by accident. How in the world, in our political system, could Donald J. Trump come on the scene in 2016 and do what he did? Tell me. But God’s watching. He’s watching what we’re going to do right now. What’s at stake is this, and I mean this: It’s our time to stand up to the socialist movement that for the last 100 years has been trying to take over our beloved America.\\nDavid Perdue: (03:27)\\nIt didn’t just start in the ’30s. It started long ago, but they believe they have it in their grasp now. They believe these CNN polls and CNBC polls. Oh, let me tell you, they don’t know the big red poll right here. But this is what I believe is a stake. Mark my words. They believe this. That if they get the majority of the Senate and they win the White House, Joe Biden has already said, your taxes are going up, guys.\\nDavid Perdue: (03:56)\\nHe’s already said. You know those regulations that those mean old demonic Republicans, all those regulations you pulled back, we’re going to give it back to you. You know that healthcare that we screwed up? We’re going to do it again. But most importantly, guys, they want to stack the Supreme Court. Did you see that? They want to stack the Supreme Court. Now what President Trump has done is brought balance back to the Supreme Court. These aren’t activists. These are constitutionalists. They’re up there to protect you and me.\\nDavid Perdue: (04:32)\\nBut the most insidious thing that Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden are trying to perpetrate, and Bernie and Elizabeth and Kamala, or what? Kamala or Kamala or Kamala mala mala, I don’t know. Whatever. They’re trying to perpetrate a lie, and that is that socialism, this radical socialism that they’re trying to sell us, is better than our beloved democracy. We’re not going to let that stand.\\nDavid Perdue: (04:57)\\nAnd here’s how they’re going to do it. You stack the courts, you change the voting rules in the Senate, and pretty soon you start adding democratic states. You get rid of the electoral college or change it like they can do, and pretty soon you’re talking about a one-party state, guys. That failed in Russia in 1917, it failed in Cuba in 1959, Venezuela today. You can’t find a country in the world where that has ever worked.\\nDavid Perdue: (05:19)\\nNow why in the world would we ever go down that road, particularly after the last 75 years in this country where God has blessed us so greatly that we can come out today and say what we want independent of what that media says? I need you to do one thing. Stand with me, stand with our President, and let’s make damn sure that the road to socialism never runs through the state of Georgia. God bless you guys.

What a nice group. Thank you very much. Beautiful, thank you.\\nCrowd: (00:50)\\nFour more years.\\nPresident Trump: (00:52)\\nThank you very much, please. We are going to be talking to our great senior citizens, that’s what I’m here for today.\\nSpeaker 1: (00:55)\\n[crosstalk 00:00:50].\\nPresident Trump: (00:56)\\nWe love our senior citizens. And I’m honored to be here in Fort Myers to reaffirm my solemn pledge to America’s seniors, it’s so important to me, I happen to be a senior. I will protect you, I will defend you, and I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and conviction that I have. You devoted your life to this country and I am devoting my life to you. My administration is working every day to give our amazing senior citizens the care, support, and respect that you deserve, and you understand that, we’ve worked together for a long time. As president, I’m deeply aware that America’s 54 million seniors have borne the heaviest burden of the China virus. Many older Americans have endured months of isolation, missing weddings, births, graduations, church, and family reunions, you know that very well, you know it all too well. My heart breaks for every grieving family that has lost a precious loved one, I feel their anguish, and I mourn their loss, I feel their pain.\\nPresident Trump: (02:09)\\nI know that the terrible pain that they have gone through, and you lose someone, and there’s nothing to describe what you have to bear, there’s nothing to describe it. In times of challenge, we turn to our fellow Americans for a shoulder to lean on and we turn to God for healing and strength, and together we will overcome. My message to America’s seniors today is one of optimism, confidence, and hope. Your sacrifice has not been in vain. The light at the end of the tunnel is near. We are rounding the turn, I say that all the time, some of the media doesn’t like hearing it, but I say it all the time, we’re rounding that turn. Don’t listen to the cynics, and angry partisans, and professional pessimists, we are Americans and we will prevail, we are prevailing, and we are… It’s amazing what’s happening, if you look at what’s going on, it’s been really very amazing.\\nPresident Trump: (03:15)\\nI’m moving heaven and earth to safeguard our seniors from the China virus to deliver life-saving therapies in record time and to distribute a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year, and we’re really doing it even sooner than that, you see what’s going on, we have the vaccines getting ready to go. Seniors will be the first in line for the vaccine and we will soon be ending this pandemic, hasn’t happened a thing like this since 1918, 1917, that was a bad one too, that was a real bad one. I will not rest until we’ve eradicated this plague from our country, and our lives, and our world, we want it out. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. Our aggressive and early action saved more than 2 million lives compared to the best estimates from last spring, you remember when they were giving you estimates.\\nPresident Trump: (04:14)\\nSince the beginning, our nation’s seniors have been my top priority, it was obvious very early on that it was affecting the seniors not young people. Young people are… They have that strong immune system and I give all credit to them, but they have a strong immune system, and 99.99, think of that. But, when you get into people that have a few more years, it’s a little bit more difficult, when you get a lot more years, it’s a lot more difficult. But, what they’ve done with therapeutics now and what they’ve done with all of the other things that they’re doing, it’s incredible. We heightened mitigation and surge testing to protect those at highest risk. We sent billions and billions of dollars in funding to personal protective equipment and distributed rapid testing to 15,400 nursing homes all over the country.\\nPresident Trump: (05:09)\\nWe’ve worked with a lot of governors and some have done a great job, and some have done not a great job, and some have done a very poor job, actually, but some have done a great job, but we’re working very closely with the governors of the states. Just this week, even the New York Times, this was shocking, was forced to admit that ‘experts are saying with genuine confidence that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than they expected’. And they’re right, but I was shocked to hear coming out of the New York Times, right? I was a little [inaudible 00:05:55], and it’s thanks to my administration’s Operation Warp Speed, incredible people. Because of advances in treatment we pioneered, and we have many treatments, but because of these great advances, we’ve reached the point where the fatality rate is reduced by 85% since April and now it’s up to probably 91%. Well, I’m here, I tell you.\\nCrowd: (06:27)\\nFour more years.\\nPresident Trump: (06:27)\\nThank you. Well, I don’t know what they gave me, but give me some more of it right now and you can have some too. No, I know exactly what that gave, it was actually pretty amazing. I’m also working with the FDA and HHS to make the antibody treatment that I received, it’s called Regeneron plus… Also, it’s incredible, and what they can do today is incredible. And they felt very confident even six months ago when they started, think of it, we got this all done in a very short period of time and now we’re going for emergency use, because we’re going to make it available to everyone who needs it for free, anybody in the country. And Eli Lilly is making a very similar drug, and Alex, they’re working very hard on that, right? Alex Azar, so thank you very much, because I want people to get it and we’re getting it free, right? So, we got to do that. If you need it, if you don’t need it, that’s even better, okay? That’s even better, but if you need it, right? You get it.\\nPresident Trump: (07:54)\\nIt’s really pretty amazing what happened, because I wasn’t feeling great and the next day I wake up and I’m saying, “Who can I fight today?” Thank you. So, our groundbreaking therapies have significantly improved and improved our outcomes for elderly patients, but I’ll not relent until all American seniors are safe, you’re going to be safe, a hundred percent safe, and we’re at a point where really so much progress has been made. Under Operation Warp Speed, we’re on track to deliver at least 100 million doses of a vaccine this year, and could even be a little bit sooner than what they were originally anticipating, with hundreds of millions more to quickly follow, Alex, remember that Alex. Today, I’m thrilled to announce that we have just finalized a partnership with CVS and Walgreens, two places you know pretty well, I guess, to immediately deliver the vaccine directly to nursing homes at no cost to our seniors, right? No cost.\\nPresident Trump: (09:15)\\nThese are very effective, once you have that vaccine you can open those doors and say, “Here I am.” But with everything that I say and everything I do, if you feel safer at home… And we can all be like, ” Let’s get out there.” And I felt as president, I knew there was risk, but I had to be out, I can’t just be locked in a basement, to put it… Lock them in a basement. I felt I had to be out there, I would see Gold Star families, [inaudible 00:00:09:44], and I’ve been looking forward for months to come into the White House, and many, many other people, military people and heads of state. And I know you put yourself at risk, but you can’t… You have to lead your life. But I say this, there are people also that would rather stay in place, stay where you are, and to those people, and I understand that very well, stay, just relax, stay until it’s gone, and it’ll be gone, but stay. Don’t feel badly or don’t feel good about it, just stay, if you feel safe, stay.\\nPresident Trump: (10:15)\\nI’m working as hard as I can so you can kiss and hug your children and grandchildren very soon, that’s something I missed also, I will be honest with you. As we shelter high-risk Americans with extreme vigilance, we must also allow lower-risk Americans to return to work and return to school. I mean, children should go to school. My young son, Baron, had it, and he had it, and all of a sudden he doesn’t have it, it’s like… It was different, it’s a whole different deal, and they should go to school, and they have to, because… I talk about the cure, right? It cannot be worse than the problem itself, it’s a very simple statement, but the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. And with young children, they have to go to school, they have to be with other kids, they have to grow up, they can’t lose a year of their life. And if you look at some of these lockdowns that the Democrats are doing in some states, if you look at North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, and Michigan, we won the case against her in Michigan.\\nPresident Trump: (11:24)\\nI mean, she’s running like a prison except for her husband who’s allowed to go boating, that doesn’t work out somehow. Fortunately, they caught him, he was going to go on the lake boating, that’s nice, but nobody else was allowed to do it. But we won the case against her for Michigan, and we freed up the state, and it’s a great thing, I mean, it’s a great thing, we freed up the state. Because that whole thing with drugs, and alcohol, and depression and all of the horrible things, we could go over a long list of things, but we can’t let that happen. So, we want the Democrat, radical left, in many cases, Democrats, we wanted to open their states, open up your states, and we’re very careful with our seniors, and that’s different, but open up your states, get it back.\\nPresident Trump: (12:16)\\nDespite punishing society-wide lockdowns in Europe, I don’t know if you’ve been watching, they’re now experiencing a massive surge in cases. Daily cases are 2500% higher in the United Kingdom, as an example, and 722% higher in Europe than in the United States, okay? No, think of that. And we wish them… And we’re working with them closely, we’re making ventilators for them. For many of the countries over there, we became the ventilator king. I mean, we didn’t have many ventilators, we had… Really, we inherited bare cupboards, I said the cupboards were bare, in many of the states they had… Cupboards were bare, and now they’re loaded up and they’re ready…\\nPresident Trump: (13:03)\\nCupboards were bare. And now they’re loaded up and they’re ready. But the hardest thing are the ventilators because of the complexity of the machine, and the cost, the size, but the pure complexity. And we make thousands of ventilators now a month and we’re sending them all over the world. We’re all set with the ventilators but we’re sending them all over the world. But hopefully you won’t need them. Soon you won’t even need them. I really think you’re going to not need the ventilators, hopefully soon, very soon. But sadly in Europe, the average daily deaths are really soaring. 402% higher in the United Kingdom. 493% higher in Europe. Meanwhile, in the United States deaths have decreased by 37%. So that’s something, right.\\nPresident Trump: (13:53)\\nThe fake news doesn’t want to tell you that, right? They want no piece of that. They don’t want anything to do with that. So whether you’re Republican or Democrat, we must use facts over fear. We have to. Science over hysteria, hope over despair, and the common good over partisan politics. And again, if you feel good, if you feel safe because it’s going to be gone, stay where you are. Don’t leave. Don’t say, “Oh gee, I have to get out.” The President said, “Let’s get out.” Stay where you are. I have a lot of friends, they’re strong people. They’re senior citizens. Great people, very successful people. Hi. Look, she’s waving. Hi. Thank you. Thank you, hun.\\nPresident Trump: (14:32)\\nBut you know they’re tough actually, but they feel comfortable until this has gone and there are people, and I do that. Do that. I might do that. If I weren’t in this position, maybe I’d be doing it myself. In this position, it’s a little tougher. But we cannot allow unscientific, panic driven, fear-based policies to deny our children and grandchildren their future, and their dreams. We can’t take a year or two years out of their lives. There’s a whole social thing going on there too.\\nPresident Trump: (15:02)\\nThese left wing lock downs will crush America, and my plan is very simple. We’re going to crush the virus and go back to exactly where we were. We’re almost getting back there now. So together, we will end this pandemic. We will rebuild our economy and we will ensure our seniors can live long, happy, secure, and healthy lives with your grandchildren and your children. You’re going to hug them, right? It’s good. Under my leadership next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country economically. We’re grateful to be joined today by Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. Alex, we’re counting on you. We’re counting… I’m going to blame him if this stuff doesn’t happen fast, right?\\nPresident Trump: (15:48)\\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid services, a fantastic woman, Administrator Seema Verma. Thank you, Seema. Great job you’re doing. A friend of mine who’s become very, very popular, I guess that was what that big applause was. I was backstage, I said, “Who just came in?” I thought Elvis entered the room. It was your Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis. Stand up. That’s great, Ron. Great.\\nPresident Trump: (16:34)\\nAnd by the way, we have some crowd. You see what’s going on outside? The mayor said, “He’s never seen anything like that. He’s never seen anything.” Now there’s a lot of love outside. I want to tell you. That’s a lot of love and we’re leading in the State of Florida, just so we understand. By perhaps a lot. Also with some warriors, Representatives Gus Bilirakis. Gus, Gus, great job, Gus. And another friend of mine, these are really terrific people, Greg Stube. Greg, thank you very much, Greg. Thank you. Thanks as well to Fort Myers, Mayor Randy Henderson. Randy. Thank you. Thank you, Randy. Good job, Randy. That’s quite a crowd, huh?\\nSpeaker 2: (17:27)\\nWelcome to town, Mr. President.\\nPresident Trump: (17:29)\\nThat’s good. Thank you very much. And Cape Coral Mayor Joe Coviello. Joe Coviello. Thank you, Joe. Great job. Great job. We’re also tremendously honored to be joined by World War II and Korean War veteran, a very brave guy, Wally Cortese. Wiley Cortese. Thank you, Wally. You look good, Wally. I’ll tell you, two wars and you’re looking good. Thank you, Wally. Appreciate it. Beautiful. Thank you very much. Thanks also to all of the members of the VFW Golden Gate Honor Guard, they’re with us today. Thank you. That’s so great. That’s so great. VFW. Fantastic job. Thank you very much for being here. As I fight to protect our amazing seniors from the China virus, I’m also fighting to protect you from another danger. One, which threatens everything we cherish, value and worked our entire lives to build and to defend. As we gathered today, seniors are under threat from a radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life. We’re not going to allow it. And you know one thing, sleepy Joe and do nothing about it. The left has been taken over by socialists and Marxists and extremists and they have. They want to transform our nation into a country that would no longer be recognizable. And their agenda will shatter America’s seniors, their plan to delay the vaccine, delay therapies and prolong the pandemic will cost thousands and thousands of lives, will be horrifying for our country.\\nPresident Trump: (19:33)\\nThey are planned for higher taxes. They want to quadruple taxes. Every company will move out. They’ll go back to where they came. We had tremendous people, tremendous companies come into our country. We’re bring in tremendous jobs, 160 million jobs, we’ve never had anything like it, before the plague and then we’re building it back up again. Last four months, we’ve set records on employment, on hiring employment. And a number that, let’s say a year ago, wouldn’t have sounded great, but now sounds incredible, 7.8% unemployment. Think of it. People were talking about 42%. We’re back down to 7.8 and we’ll be soon down to the number where we were, seven months ago. Pretty amazing.\\nPresident Trump: (20:20)\\nI never thought I’d be happy with 7.8%, but you know when you think about it, right, they were talking 39%, 42%. Ron, 7.8 is a pretty amazing thing. We did that in a rapid fashion. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it, actually. They’re planned for higher taxes and crippling regulations, however, would crater our economy. Their insane energy policies because you know they’re going to be fracking. Hey, Biden for a year and a half is saying there will be no fracking. Then he looks out, he gets the nomination because Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So Bernie, a second time, that happened twice to Bernie. Bernie, he’s a hell of a loser. That’s one thing I’ll say. He knows how to lose. He knows how to lose. He loses he goes back to work like nothing happened. No, they took it away from him twice. I think the second time in a way worse, because she stayed in, she took the votes and sleepy Joe just got in there. That’s why you got to be careful. You got to be careful. You never know what happens.\\nPresident Trump: (21:23)\\nBut if you take a look and we can’t let any of this stuff happen. And you look at what’s happened to other countries, where they’ve had this philosophy, where they’ve had this ideology. We can’t let… But you watch what they’re saying about the fracking, where he said no, and he said it with such… It’s not like, “Well, I’ll think about it.” He’s doing the same thing with the courts right now. They’re going to pack the Supreme Court. You see what they want to do. Would be destruction of our country. But you take a look. So he says, “No, there will be no fracking.” These are the words. “There will be no fracking. You don’t understand what I just said. There will be no fracking.” And then he gets very agitated. “There would be no fracking.”\\nPresident Trump: (22:06)\\nAnd he gets a nomination, goes to Pennsylvania, they inform him that they have a million jobs and fracking’s a big deal. And they like inexpensive energy, right? And so, he goes from, “There will be no fracking with great anger”, to “I never said they wouldn’t be fracking.” It’s the craziest thing. If that ever happened to me and the media doesn’t even talk about it. That’s just one of many things. Then he does that thing with the courts. You see that, right? He goes, “I’ll tell you after the election what I’m going to do.” How important is it? Because he’s going to put on radical, left, crazy judges that will destroy your lives. It’s the most important. They’ve always said… I’ve always heard, Ron, I’ve always heard this, that the most important thing a president does is pick Supreme Court Justices, right? I would say maybe the military, but let’s say it’s right there. And he has to create a list of more than just that, he has to create a list and let you know and he has to pick from that list. That’s what I did. I created a list of 25 people, highly, highly capable people. And a lot of people said, that’s why I won the election, actually. So I don’t know if that’s true or not. But it was a very important part, Mary, you understand mayors, you know that.\\nPresident Trump: (23:29)\\nSo their insane energy policies will abolish millions of jobs and cost seniors thousands of dollars per year in higher energy bills. Their anti-police agenda will empower violent mobs and put every community at risk. Their anti-suburban agenda threatens the property values of millions of American seniors and your families, who own homes in residential neighborhoods, in the suburbs. I’m saving the suburbs. People saying, “Well, women in the suburbs, do they like Trump?” I said, “Yeah, they liked me. You know why they like, because I’m saving their homes.” That’s why they like me. They may not like me, but they like what I’m doing, and that’s more important.\\nPresident Trump: (24:17)\\nOh boy, they have these crazy people. The people on television, I don’t know if suburban women, suburban women want security. They want safety. They want law and order. They want their homes to be protected. The socialist ideology that they will use and indoctrinate our youth with is like poisonous Anti-American propaganda.\\nPresident Trump: (24:46)\\nThe plan by Washington Democrats to give amnesty and free healthcare to illegal border crossers will obliterate Medicare, bankrupt your social security, robbing you of the benefits that you’ve paid for your entire lives. Look, take a look at Venezuela. People don’t realize, that was a wealthy country 18, 17 years ago. It was so wealthy. And it’s gone from being wealthy, they don’t have medicine, they don’t have food, they don’t have water. They don’t have anything. And it can happen here, just a much larger version with that ideology. And that’s the ideology that they’re looking at. It’s crazy.\\nPresident Trump: (25:23)\\nThese radicals will destroy Medicare with totally open borders. And by the way, you know the wall, it’s up to almost 400 miles. 400. 400 miles. And it goes down deep, tunneling. It goes down deep and up very high. Now it’s had a tremendous… We’ve never had a stronger Southern border than we have right now. It’ll be finished very soon. We’re doing 10 miles a week. That’s a lot. 10 miles a week. Army Corps of Engineers are also doing Lake Okeechobee and lots of other things, right? They’re doing a good job, right? They’re giving away your benefits, that’s what-\\nPresident Trump: (26:03)\\nThey’re giving away your benefits, that’s what they want to do to anyone in the world who trespasses into our country. And we all have big hearts and we want to take care of people. But when you say, “We’re going to give you free healthcare. We’re going to give you college education.” I sarcastically said once, “We’re going to give you a beautiful brand new Rolls-Royce. Okay? If you’re an illegal immigrant. And CNN went and they said, “The President lied to the seniors.” They just don’t get it. They get it. Actually, unfortunately they get it more than you would think. They’re a little bit on the evil side.\\nPresident Trump: (26:39)\\nBut, you’re going to bring millions of people … You’re going to bring millions and millions of people. It’s like, when you say, “Free healthcare, and free education, and free this and that,” millions of people are going to pour into the country. It’s not going to be stoppable. And we can’t let that happen. They care more about illegal aliens than they care about senior citizens, the Democrats. The left is coming after me because I’m defending you. And that’s true. That’s why they come after me. Every day they come … But we caught them on the Russian hoax. We finally caught them after two and a half years. Russia knows. Turned out to be the exact opposite. They’re the ones that were playing with Russia. That was a beauty. Hillary … Crooked Hillary. Now they’re the ones. Yeah, I agree with you. I used to just be quiet. And I agree with you 100%. Millions and millions of dollars they paid. And they tried to show it. It was the greatest hoax and the greatest political crime in the history of our country. That’s what they committed. But I’m the only one standing between their open borders and extremism and the healthcare benefits that you’ve earned and paid for. All your life, you paid for. As long as I’m President, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare or your social security. As a candidate, I made a sacred promise that I’d strengthen, protect and defend your Medicare benefits. And that’s exactly what I’ve done. I’ve done that, right?\\nPresident Trump: (28:24)\\nMy administration’s fought to deliver greater security, affordability, fairness, economic stability to our nation’s seniors. Under eight years of the previous administration, premiums for Medicare health plans went up including a 25% increase right here in Florida. That’s for the previous people. Under my administration, we’ve lowered Medicare Advantage premiums by a number nobody even believes, 34% nationwide. And today, it’s the lowest level in 14 years. Did you know that, Ron? That’s not a bad thing for you to put into your speech, right? Who would think that? No, but seriously, we’ve brought it way down. This group over here, they’ve done a great job. Thanks to our efforts, there are 2,000 … Thank you.\\nPresident Trump: (29:16)\\nThere are 2,000 more Medicare Advantage plans today than there were three years ago. That’s incredible. Think of that. That means more choice and more competition for better care at a much lower cost. When we rapidly expanded telehealth for Medicare beneficiaries during the pandemic, the number of tele-health users increased from 14,000 a week to 1.7 million a week. What’s that percentage? Yet, all of this danger, it’s all in danger because if these other people get in, they will end all of that. The telehealth … It’s interesting. We’ve learned something for children, they’re much better in a classroom than they are on a laptop. Okay? Children.\\nPresident Trump: (30:03)\\nBut for your health and what you can do, you can do so much of it, such a big percentage, better than going out and going through … This telehealth has been amazing. It’s been really incredible. It’s been an incredible thing. It’s increased like six, 7,000, I think 6500%. And it’s probably the only thing that came out of this whole deal that we really can take pleasure at, telehealth. It’s been really an incredible thing that’s happened. Over 130 Democrats in Congress, including far left Senator Kamala Harris, who is the most … I said, “He’ll never choose her because nobody treated him worse than her. Nobody.” Plus, her poll numbers were sinking. She never even got to Iowa. She never got there. And when I said, “Oh … ”\\nPresident Trump: (31:01)\\nAnd by the way, didn’t Mike Pence do a good job the other night? Right? Good man. Did a great job. And I had a great … Thank you. Really, I had a lot of fun last night with that. That was a nice evening. It was a nice pleasurable evening. I had somebody going totally crazy last night. “But, I told you … I told you that.” She told me? She’s going to … Oh, okay. I believe you, right? No, but I understand that worked out very well last night. That’s what the word is, so that’s good. Another evening in paradise, I call it. They’re sponsoring a socialist healthcare plan that would annihilate your Medicare. The Democrats’ policy proposals may go by different names. They put all sorts of names. They say single payer, or so-called the public option.\\nPresident Trump: (32:03)\\nBut really, they’re all based on the same core promise, raiding Medicare to fund a socialist healthcare takeover. And it’s going to destroy your Medicare. That’s the one thing you know for sure. Every one of their plans involves rationing care, restricting access, denying coverage, slashing quality, extending wait times and massively raising your taxes. Other than that, it’s actually quite good. As we know from seeing these left wing policies in action around the world, seniors will be the victims. And that’s what happens, the first to go are the seniors, the victims are really the seniors. This is nothing that unique. Socialist healthcare plans always end up denying care and coverage to the sick and the elderly in order to control costs.\\nPresident Trump: (32:54)\\nAnd they always feel that this is the easiest way to do it. We must not let them bring this lethal and deadly agenda to America. Don’t let it happen. Got to vote them out. Get out and vote. Democrat healthcare proposals would abolish private insurance for 180 million Americans. Just so you know, there are many people, they’ve had a good life, they’ve done well. They have private plans. They are unbelievable. They love their plan. Those plans are gone. Those plans are gone. They’d abolish the Medicare Advantage program that benefits 24 million seniors, including one out of two Hispanic seniors and one out of three African-American seniors who enrolled in the Medicare Advantage. Right?\\nPresident Trump: (33:46)\\nAnd that will all be ended. It would be abolished, for big fat, ugly socialized medicine. You go to a hospital, you don’t feel good. Go to a hospital room and wait for three days to see a doctor. I will never allow that to happen. Under my administration, your Medicare Advantage is safe. Your benefits are protected. And I will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always, always, always. They always play that card, right? Remember they used to say, “Oh, he’s going to give up.” At first they said I was going to be in a war within the first week. Whatever happened to that, right? Just the opposite. Our great warriors are coming home. They’re all coming home. They’re all coming home. You’re welcome.\\nPresident Trump: (34:38)\\nLook at North Korea, they thought would be a war and a war immediately with North Korea. How’s that worked out, right? It’s worked out very nicely. Talk, we’ll talk, keep talking. But it worked out very well. But the other thing they said, “He will destroy your social security.” Really? Did I? I said, “No.” No, they’re going to destroy it, because they’ll destroy our country. They’ll destroy your social security and they’ll destroy your country. And Joe won’t have any idea what happened, because he’s gone. Let’s face it. He’s gone. Another critical issue for senior citizens is the price of prescription drugs. This is something I’m very proud of, because we’ve lowered Part D prescription drug premiums by 12%, saving senior citizens $1.9 billion.\\nPresident Trump: (35:23)\\nBut the biggest yet to come, I stood up to big pharma, and that’s not easy. They got big money. They’re the biggest lobbyist in this country by far. And I signed an executive order, implemented a most favorite nations policy for the United States. For years you’ve heard, “We pay more for drugs than any other country.” Well, that’s not even close. We pay much more. And in other countries that we know very well take advantage of us and they pay a fraction. I mean, you wouldn’t even believe how much less, but a fraction. 25 cents for a pill, as opposed to $2 for a pill. Same pill from the same lab plant, right? And I instituted a favorite nations clause. I said, if Germany or some other country is getting our stuff low, I want a favored nations. Meaning, I want it for the same price. And they have gone crazy.\\nPresident Trump: (36:18)\\nI have never seen so many ads. They put on more ads against me now than sleepy Joe Biden, I’m telling you, and they understand. Look, it should have been done a long time ago. This should’ve been done years ago. Plus, I got rid of the middleman and I gave Ron DeSantis the right to go to Canada in the meantime, because I think eventually you’ll be using this. But in the meantime, you’ll also be getting the rebates. Okay? Rebates, you know who they go to? The middlemen. You know how rich the middlemen are? I’m rich. These guys blow everyone away. I don’t know … Nobody even knows who the hell they are. Did you ever hear … Does anybody know a middleman? I would like to meet. It’s Biden’s son. It’s Hunter. Oh, it’s Hunter. I’ll bet you Hunter is a middleman. He’s collecting …\\nPresident Trump: (37:14)\\nHe’s like a vacuum cleaner, he follows his father around collecting. What a disgrace. It’s a crime family. You want to know something? It’s a crime family. He’s following his father. Hunter Biden is a middleman. Oh, that’s wild. No, these people are amazing. These middlemen, you’re right. Hunter made no money until his father became Vice President and now he’s like a vacuum cleaner. His father goes to Germany, Hunter’s right there. “Hey, give me a couple of million.” Not a couple of million. Hell of a lot more than a couple of million. That’s a shame. I’ll tell you what, it’s an organized crime family, as far as I’m concerned. I capped out of pocket costs … And the way they get protected by big tech and by the media, the media doesn’t want to ask … This is the hottest subject there is right now.\\nPresident Trump: (38:04)\\nAnd I didn’t watch sleepy Joe last night. I just wanted to see what he looked like. He wasn’t looking too good. I just couldn’t watch, it was too painful. But, they didn’t … I understand that they did not ask him a question about this. Can you believe it? Now, think of it. And Stephanopoulos interviewed me two weeks ago and he was nasty. He was nasty. I mean, he was tough. He’s a tough guy.\\nPresident Trump: (38:29)\\nI watched last night, the little stuff I watched and what I heard, it was like softballs, every … But he didn’t … This is the hottest subject there is. They didn’t ask them one question about their corruption in the family. They didn’t ask him one question about how big tech is protecting him. Big tech is not allowing anybody to … How about this? They took down, I guess, Kayleigh, but they took … How about Kayleigh? Isn’t she great? No, but they took down her Twitter site because she had the audacity to put up-\\nPresident Trump: (39:03)\\n… on her Twitter site because she had the audacity to put up an article written in the New York Post, which is one of the biggest newspapers in the country. I think it’s the oldest newspaper in the country. They put up a article, and they took down her site. Can you believe what’s going on in this country? And then they talk about freedom of the press. They also said last night, it was very interesting, they talked about the transition, the friendly transition. Will you agree to the friendly … Of course the answer is yes. First of all, I don’t think there’s going to be a transition because we’re going to win but … Let’s hope we don’t have to worry about it. No, but think of this. They get up, “We demand a friendly transition.” Yet, we caught them spying on my campaign, and trying to take down the president of the United States. Right? That wasn’t too friendly. Right? That wasn’t too friendly, and we caught them cold.\\nPresident Trump: (39:55)\\nAnyway, let’s get back to the medical parts of the world. This is much simpler to understand, if you think about it. But I capped out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 a month. People were going, literally they were going bankrupt over insulin, or they weren’t getting the insulin, which is a terrible thing. It’s $35 a month or less for seniors in many Medicare drug plans, saving them an average of nearly $450. I mean that’s a tremendous saving. Many cases much less than 35. Seema, in many cases much less than the 35. Right? Did you say $1 in some cases? What’s your lowest number? Come on, Seema. Let’s hear it. Huh? She doesn’t want to give too much. I think maybe $1 is too much. Okay. She’s very straight. She’s a straight player. You brought it down from what number? The 35 down from what Seema?\\nSeema: (40:53)\\n[inaudible 00:01:53].\\nPresident Trump: (40:56)\\nTremendously. Yeah. It’s a great job. You did that. But she would come up to me for a year and a half talking about the insulin. The insulin is the biggest, it’s such a problem for people where they’d go without it. They had no choice because it was too expensive. Great job both of you. Thank you very much.\\nPresident Trump: (41:16)\\nI also announced that more than 35 million Medicare beneficiaries will soon receive a card in the mail with $200 that you can use to help pay for prescription drugs. But I was going to tell you, I’ve allowed Ron DeSantis now to go to Canada and buy your prescription drugs. Now, why am I doing that? Because before all of the favored nations and everythings kick in, which ultimately I think that’s what you’re going to be using more than anything. But Canada gets their drugs for about 50% of what we get them for. Same drug, same exact pill, company, everything, Johnson & Johnson, whatever the company, Ron is going to buy from Canada, and he’s just cut your price in half. Right? Right? When are you starting that Ron? When do you think you’ll start?\\nRon DeSantis: (42:08)\\n[inaudible 00:42:08].\\nPresident Trump: (42:10)\\nWhen?\\nRon DeSantis: (42:10)\\nVery soon.\\nPresident Trump: (42:11)\\nVery soon. So Alex get him approved up. Okay? Whatever you have to do. I think it’s great. Some people say, “Well that doesn’t …” My attitude is, whatever the hell it takes. We have this terrible system that’s taken years and years to rig. Like the ballots. Right? Like the ballots. It’s taken them years and years to rig. So they’re very simple. Go buy from Canada. We get rid of the middleman. We get rid of all of this nonsense. You like that mayor? You like that mayor? Both of you? Pretty great Ron. Do it fast Ron. Do it fast. To care for, I mean you’re not going to believe what’s going to be happening with your numbers. I mean they’re coming down big.\\nPresident Trump: (42:49)\\nWe’re not talking about 1%. I mean I don’t even want to mention it, but last year out of 51 years, this is the first time the prescription drug prices have come down in 51 years. They didn’t come down much. They came down like 1%, which I don’t want to mention in one way. But in another way, it tells you something. First time in 51 years when drug prices come down. But now you’re talking about a 50, 60, 70, and 80% reduction in your prescription drug prices. We got to get it all finished up. Wouldn’t it be terrible if Sleepy Joe took this over, the system that I’ve created? And you people will say, “Man, has he been a great president. Look at what he’s done.”\\nPresident Trump: (43:32)\\nAs an example, transparency starts on January 1st. I said to my people, “You couldn’t start it like in August, back? They said, “Sir, you have to go statutorily here, here, here.” I say, “Yeah, but I’d better win this damn election because, can you imagine, mayor, he’ll be saying, “Boy, I’m getting a lot of credit. What the hell did Trump do? This is unbelievable.” I promise you, they won’t give the credit to us. Will, they, huh? No, but I think we’re not going to have to worry about it. I hope that … get out and vote, vote, vote. To care for our nation’s veterans, I signed into law VA Choice and VA Accountability. Nobody thought that would be possible. Right? Nobody thought that would be possible.\\nPresident Trump: (44:17)\\nWe’ve also invested billions and billions of dollars in research and innovative treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, kidney disease, sickle cell disease, AIDS, cancer, and many other illnesses. I will say this, AIDS will be eradicated in this country now in six years. I started right at the beginning. President Obama should have started, he could have started it two years before, or two and a half years before. They wasted two years. But we started it right at the beginning of the administration, and it was a ten-year program. We’re down to six years. In six years it will be essentially eradicated in our country. Think of that. Who would have thought that? It’s an amazing thing. It should have been started before I got into office. It could have been.\\nPresident Trump: (45:04)\\nDay after day I’m fighting to defend our seniors from the virus, from Big Pharma, oh they love me, special interests, and from the radical socialist left. American seniors, remind us that we’ve inherited an incredible, extraordinary legacy. You’re the generation that defeated Fascism and triumphed over Communism, sent American astronauts to the moon. You built our country into the greatest and most powerful nation the world has ever known. Frankly, right now it’s more powerful than it ever was. When I took over, we had a depleted military. We have now a military … we have the greatest weapons on Earth. We are the envy of the world.\\nPresident Trump: (45:49)\\nWe have the greatest weapons, the missiles, rockets, tanks, the tankers, the freighters, the boats, the ships, the jet fighters, F-35s, the F-18s, F-16s. Nobody has the equipment that we have in the world. Not even close. Even the hypersonic missiles. You know? Under the Obama Administration, they stole our plans for hypersonic. That’s the super-duper, I call them the super-duper missiles. The ones that go so fast, you can’t even see them, and now we have that. You probably read about it last night. We have the fastest by far in the world.\\nPresident Trump: (46:29)\\nNow we’re doing a great job, and our seniors and generations of Americans before you, they did not pour out their heart, and soul, and blood, and tears, for this country only now to surrender our freedom, our flag, and our American way of life. You seniors have protected us, and now I as a senior and all of my people, we are protecting you. Your courage, your leadership, your patriotism, and your faith, are an inspiration to us all. With your help we will transcend every obstacle, defeat every threat, and triumph over every single challenge. We will lift our nation to new heights of greatness and glory, and America will emerge stronger, more united, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before. For our nation, for our great seniors, and for our beloved children and grandchildren, the best is yet to come. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.





       "            Joe Biden              Joe Biden Southfield, MI Speech on Health Care October 16                                                                                  Joe Biden: (00:00)\\nHello, Michigan. Hi, how are you? What’s your name? Sam, good to see you, man. Thanks for being here. I appreciate it. Alexia, thank you for taking the time telling your story, it’s important. Unfortunately, there are an awful lot of stories like yours all over America as I travel the country, too many, it don’t have to be. And, folks, it’s great to be back, it’s great to be here.\\nJoe Biden: (00:39)\\nThere’s not a better governor in the United States of America than Gretchen Whitmer, that’s a fact. I’ve met virtually all of them. And Gary, we badly need you back in the United States Senate, pal, we badly need you back in the United States Senate. And then my sister, Debbie Stabenow. God love you, Debbie. We worked so closely together for so long and as vice-president as well.\\nJoe Biden: (01:13)\\nFolks, look, we need to send Gary back to another term. Standing up for Michigan, Michigan families, small businesses. He was our main congressional partner back in 2010 when we passed the critical legislation supporting small businesses. I remember the president gave me the responsibility to go out and round up support. My go-to guy to get it done, I mean it sincerely was Gary. He was the go-to guy and he always shows up and he always shows up for Michigan.\\nJoe Biden: (01:51)\\nAnd like all of you, Jill and I are so grateful that the governor and her family are safe. It’s an unusual year. Governor you’ve been through a lot but my Lord, you are a leader. You stand up straight and tall and you don’t bend. Governor, it’s not easy to lead in moments of crisis but that’s a determination of whether you are a real leader when you stepped up to the crisis and you’ve stepped up, you’ve done it and you keep doing it.\\nJoe Biden: (02:18)\\nAnd as I said a moment ago you’re pretty much doing it better than anybody else in the whole United States of America. You’ve shown this whole nation just how tough and thoughtful you are, tough just like Michigan. I’ve got to believe this state has to be so proud of you. I know personally I am as I’ve gotten to know you and proud to call your friend, gov.\\nJoe Biden: (02:45)\\nWe’re grateful to the FBI and law enforcement to discover these domestic terrorists and stop them. And make no mistake, that’s who they are, domestic terrorists, flat terrorists. Planning to blow up a bridge on American soil, to threaten the lives of police officers, to kidnap an elected later and now we’re finding out the same thing was happening in Virginia. It’s the sort of behavior you might expect from ISIS and it should shock the conscious of every American, every American. And the failure to condemn these folks is stunning from the outset. I remember it matters. You’ve heard me say it before, “Words matter.” And the words of a president particularly matter. When the president tweeted, “Liberate Michigan, liberate Michigan,” that’s the call that was heard, that was the dog whistle. Just like when he said, “Very fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.” Fathers, they came out of the fields carrying torches, their veins bulging, shouting antisemitic bile, carrying Nazi flags accompanied by the Klu Klux Klan.\\nJoe Biden: (04:10)\\nBut when a young woman was killed protesting the president was asked what he think and he said something no president has ever, ever, ever, ever heard, “There were very fine people on both sides.” Those words were heard just like when he stood on the debate stage with me and refused to denounce white supremacists but told that white ring extremist group to “stand back and stand by.” Stand back and stand by, an American president? Not only shocked us but it stunned the world. Those words we heard.\\nJoe Biden: (05:09)\\nYou know the reason I decided to run for president and I know that Debbie knows this. I hadn’t planned on running ever again after my son died. But when I saw those folks coming out of those woods I thought, “How in God’s name, how in God’s name can I remain silent?” And I said at the time it was somewhat not criticized but people didn’t think it was… Well, I don’t know what it was. When I said, “I think we’re in a battle for the soul of America,” I think we are.\\nJoe Biden: (05:47)\\nWhat I saw at Charlottesville and the president’s response to it is why I went to Gettysburg Battlefield of Pennsylvania last week. Because I thought there was need to stand up to hate in America and urge as Lincoln did to come together as a nation. Well, I’ve learned hate never goes away, it only hides. It never goes away, and if you’re given oxygen it comes out from one of the rocks, it grows. We need to be clear from the president going down in this country, there is no place for hate in America, period, none, it will not be tolerated.\\nJoe Biden: (06:37)\\nBut President Trump revels in division and chaos to do anything to distract us from focusing on his failures to deal with this virus and to protect the nation. He’s still living in a dream world. He keeps telling us that this virus is going to disappear like America. He said, I think last night in his town hall, I didn’t have the pleasure of hearing it, I was doing one myself. He said, “We have turned the corner.” And my grandfather was sitting in my chair where he said, “He’s gone around the bunny.”\\nJoe Biden: (07:24)\\nTurned the corner? My Lord. It’s not disappearing, in fact it’s on the rise again. It’s getting worse as predicted. And we all know the terrible price this nation has paid. Lives lost, unemployment way up, across Michigan and the country folks are worried about making their next rent payment and mortgage payment. Or their healthcare will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic that you worked so damn hard, Gary, to keep. Worried about…\\nJoe Biden: (08:01)\\nAnd we talked about this, Alexia. Kids in school, are they able to get back to school? More than 215,000 Americans, I think it’s 217 as of this morning, Americans have died from COVID-19. And experts have said, and I’ve been saying for the last month and a half that nearly another 200,000 lives are likely to be lost in the coming months between now and the first of the year if we continue to refuse to follow science. Because he refused to embracing wearing a mask, how many times on television have you seen him make fun of Biden wearing a mask? Because he refuses to practice social distancing he puts his supporters in such jeopardy. It’s estimated…\\nJoe Biden: (09:01)\\nIt’s estimated by his own folks, if we just wore masks nationally, almost 100,000 lives would be saved in the next few months. His own director of CDC said while we’re waiting for a vaccine, even if we had a vaccine, this will prevent more deaths between now and the end of January than a vaccine would. Know what’s really sad about all this? And I’ve been talking about this, but every time I repeat it, I get more… Well, I’m not very happy.\\nJoe Biden: (09:49)\\nThe president knew and lied about knowing. He knew in January. The intelligence community and what they call the PDB, the Presidential Daily Briefings, which I’ve sat in on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them as vice-president. It got out that they laid out in detail to him how devastating this could be, how much life could be lost, and so on. He said he was unaware of it. Didn’t read those reports. Well, that surprised no one, he didn’t read the reports, but he didn’t read the reports. And everybody said, “Well, maybe he didn’t.”\\nJoe Biden: (10:38)\\nBut then as was acknowledged because of his ego, he wanted to impress a famous journalist, he thought he could change his mind about his view of him, he did a long interview with Bob Woodward. Bob Woodward, a renowned journalist, taped the interview with him, extensive interviews, hours. And he taped an interview where Trump said he knew this disease was deadly, significantly worse than the flu. But that’s not what he told you. That’s not what he told the public.\\nJoe Biden: (11:25)\\nAnd the reason he lied again to the American people? Well, he said he didn’t want to panic the American people. Americans don’t panic. Donald Trump panicked. That’s who panicked. As a consequence of his overwhelming lying, negligence, and irresponsible action, how many empty chairs were around the kitchen table this morning or the dining room table last night? How many? How many women or men leaned over when they got in bed last night and reached over to touch their husband and wife, and they weren’t there? You all know what loss is. It’s profound, especially when it was avoidable, much of it.\\nJoe Biden: (12:29)\\nBut mishandling the pandemic isn’t enough for Trump. On top of that, he’s still trying to take away your healthcare. Trump’s still determined in the midst of this pandemic. And by the way, if projections… Pray, God, they’re not right, Father. But if they’re right, though, in the next several months, there’ll be over 200,000 additional deaths. That would be in one year 400,000 Americans would have died. That’s more than lost in all of World War II, hear me? World War II was four years. More American souls would have been lost than in World War II.\\nJoe Biden: (13:20)\\nWhat’s he doing? He’s still determined to destroy the Affordable Care Act. This isn’t hyperbole. Just like your opponent calls it a disaster. Talk about a disaster, there’s a disaster. The guy is 2000% or 200%, whatever it is with Trump. Hope everybody remembers. Look, as I said, this isn’t hyperbole. It’s real, as real as it gets. On November 10th the United States Supreme Court will hear the Trump administration make the case that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down in its entirety.\\nJoe Biden: (14:05)\\nI know everybody thinks they know, but I just want to remind you 10 million of you have already lost your health insurance because your employer’s health insurance, they’ve gone out of business. 10 million Americans already without health insurance. If Trump gets his way, 20 million more Americans will lose their health care. That’s God awful. In the midst of this God awful economic crisis, 100 million Americans will lose their protections for pre-existing conditions, including more than 4 million people right here in Michigan. Lifetime limits on benefits will be back.\\nJoe Biden: (14:56)\\nAnd by the way, a lot of you’ve been through what I’ve been through and worse. I can distinctly remember sitting on a bed with my Beau, my son, who came back from a year serving in Iraq, which this president talks about losers who serve, losers. With the same significant disease that your mom had, stage four glioblastoma. When it was diagnosed, when he got home, we asked the docs. It was only a matter of months, not if, just months. We never gave up hope. I remember watching him on that bed. He made it almost 16 months.\\nJoe Biden: (16:11)\\nToward the end, and this is not about me, it’s about all of you, I consciously thought to myself, what would it feel like if they were able to walk in and say, “Mr Biden, you’ve outrun your insurance coverage. Suffer the last two or three months in pain on your own. Lots of luck.” Because that’s what was happening before.\\nJoe Biden: (16:49)\\nInsurers, if they win, and that’s what this court packing going on now is about, insurers will no longer allow you to keep your kids on your policy till age 26 in the middle of this economic crisis. Women, once again, will be charged more for their healthcare just because they’re a woman. Older folks will be able to be charged more. And as the governor said, long-term complications from COVID will become pre-existing conditions, joining asthma, diabetes, even pregnancy is a preexisting condition before. It could allow insurers to jack up your premiums or deny coverage altogether.\\nJoe Biden: (17:34)\\nGetting rid of Obamacare is why they’re racing to get this nominee through the Supreme Court. Make no mistake about it. Trump’s made it clear from the beginning, as your opponent has. He wants to get rid of Obamacare in its entirety. And with this nominee, he’s made that incredibly clear, as well. Michigan deserves so much better. Deserves leaders like-\\nJoe Biden: (18:03)\\nMichigan deserves so much better, deserves leaders like Gary and Debbie Stabenow, public servants who lead with decency and honor, always look out for your needs, will think about how to ease the burden on your family.\\nJoe Biden: (18:22)\\nThat’s the sort of leader you’ve got in Gretchen, in Governor Whitmer, as well. When she was in the state senate, she led the charge to secure Obamacare Medicaid expansion for more than 800,000 Michiganders. Think about this now. Some of those States, Republican governors did not expand, even though the federal government was paying for it front end. There’s millions of people have no coverage.\\nJoe Biden: (18:50)\\nAfter we passed Obamacare with the help of Debbie and Gary, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, we were able to reduce the uninsured rate by 55% here in Michigan. And if I have the honor of becoming your president, we’ll build on the Affordable Care Act, no matter what they do.\\nJoe Biden: (19:11)\\nYou can choose to keep a private plan, if you still have one. Because some of the private plans negotiated, the UAW owners are good plans. But we’ll also offer you a Medicare like public health insurance option. It’ll force private insurers to keep premiums low and offer better coverage because, for the first time, they’ll have to compete for your business against a public insurer that doesn’t have the profit motive in mind.\\nJoe Biden: (19:38)\\nIf you choose this public option or a private plan will increase subsidies for your premiums, so that they’re lower. You can afford our plans with lower deductibles, lower out-of-pocket spending. An independent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. Not a liberal think tank, serious folks looking at this. Here’s the bottom line. My plan lowers healthcare costs and gets universal coverage quickly at a time when Michigan families desperately are going to need that relief and they need it now. Families are reeling right now. They need a lifeline now. I promise you. When I’m president I’ll take care of your health coverage, the same way I would my own family.\\nJoe Biden: (20:29)\\nI grew up like a lot of people in this state. In Scranton, Pennsylvania and Wilmington, Delaware in a three bedroom, split level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. I can remember how my dad, when we moved from Scranton for no work, we moved down to Delaware. He stayed with my grandpop for a year, he came home every weekend. Finally got a job. We got an apartment we lived in, and ended up being section eight housing years later, but it was decent. We were happy.\\nJoe Biden: (20:59)\\nIt took my dad about three years to get a job good enough that he could actually buy a home. And he bought that small home at the time a suburban sprawl was going on. There were 70 homes like it, three and four bedrooms homes. But the walls were thin. I look back and I wonder how my mom and dad did it, come to think of it. I remember one night, my dad, you could hear him restlessly rolling in bed. Our bedroom was next to it. And I asked my mom the next morning, what’s wrong with Dad? She said, “Honey, it’s complicated.” I said, “What’s the matter, Mom?” I was 14 years old. She said, “Well, his company just lost his health insurance. We’re going to be okay, honey.”\\nJoe Biden: (21:42)\\nThink of all the people rolling around in bed tonight, tomorrow night, last night. Trump doesn’t see things this way because he only sees the world from a Park Avenue perspective. I’m not being a wise guy, I’m being literal. He can only see from his penthouse, Wall Street.\\nJoe Biden: (22:10)\\nI see the world from where I grew up like many of you. I grew up in Scranton, as I said. My mom taught me. My mom had a backbone like a ramrod. My mom taught me. She said, “Joey, look at me, look at me.” Because I used to stutter. She said, “Nobody’s better than you, Joey, but everybody’s your equal.” That’s how I was raised.\\nJoe Biden: (22:33)\\nI think you and I, we measure people, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, we measure people on the strength of their character. Honesty, decency, recognizing that some things are bigger than just your self-interest. That’s what America is about. That’s who we are. It’s about family, respect, decency, honor, opportunity. Our families and yours, we weren’t asking for anything. Just a shot, just an even shot. Given a shot, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let their country down.\\nJoe Biden: (23:13)\\nThat’s what Michigan needs now, a shot to come back strong. That’s what you needed 10 years ago in your automobile industry, the heart and soul of Michigan was on the brink. My state used to be an auto state. Small population, we had the highest percentage of auto workers of any state in the nation because we had less than a million people. The largest General Motors and Chrysler plants outside of Michigan. But you all remember like I do. You remember what it was like yesterday.\\nJoe Biden: (23:52)\\nWhen Barack and I decided we had to bet on Michigan, remember all the blow back even from some Democrats. We can’t compete. We bet on auto workers, we bet on the UAW and they came through and it paid off. For real. The industry wasn’t in trouble because of the auto workers, it was in trouble because of management decisions. Over the objective of many, we stepped in and rescued the automobile industry, General Motors and Chrysler, saving over 1 million jobs by that one deal.\\nJoe Biden: (24:36)\\nDon’t ever underestimate the American worker. By contrast on Donald Trump’s watch, we were in a nationwide manufacturing recession before COVID struck. And we’re now down nearly 650,000 manufacturing jobs across the country now. Now, and it’s rising. In fact, Donald Trump will be the first president in modern American history to leave office, God willing, to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he started in office. Last one was Herbert Hoover. For real.\\nJoe Biden: (25:19)\\nFolks, we can bring this economy back. I’m positive of it. I’m optimistic about it. We know how to go about doing it. An independent analysis on Wall Street, Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, has done an in-depth analysis of every aspect of my plan, as well as his. You know what their conclusion was? This is Moody’s, now. That my plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his would, and $1 trillion more in economic growth than the president’s plan, by investing in people.\\nJoe Biden: (26:09)\\nBy the way, you see these ads here in Michigan, Biden’s going to raise your taxes. Once again, flat, unadulterated lie. No one who makes less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more. If you make more than that, you’re going to start paying at the rate you paid under the administration of George W. Bush at 39.6%. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the very wealthy to pay their fair share for a change. Trump’s more than $2 trillion tax cut, I’m going to roll back 1.5 trillion of that in the giveaways to the biggest companies in the top 1%. And the money we raise, we’ll invest in working people, in growing the middle class. And this time, make sure we bring everybody along, black, white, Hispanic-\\nJoe Biden: (27:03)\\nThis time, make sure we bring everybody along. Black, white, Hispanic, disabled. Everyone comes along. Outside economists said my plan will create millions of good paying union jobs in manufacturing. We’re going to invest in building more resilient infrastructure. Remember the president said, “I have an infrastructure plan.” In 2017, and then 2018 and 2019, now 2020. He doesn’t have any plan. I’m going to build a resilient infrastructure, creating good paying jobs. Building roads and bridges and ports. One million new jobs and affordable housing units. Should be one million new affordable housing units. High-speed broadband for every household. A 100 billion dollars to rebuild our crumbling schools. One of the reasons we can’t send our kids back to schools. A lot of them aren’t even safe now.\\nJoe Biden: (28:03)\\nWe’re going to retrofit as we started our administration when the president allowed me to run the recovery act. We’re going to retrofit four million buildings and weatherize two billion homes. That alone will save 100s of thousands of millions of barrels of oil. It’s all going to be done by certified union labor. I’m going to end Trump’s incentives. He talks about his trade deals. As Gary and Debbie know in his trade deals he incentivized people to send jobs abroad.\\nJoe Biden: (28:47)\\nAbroad. More taking their jobs overseas. One thing more the United States Government owns and maintains enormous fleet of vehicles. I promise you, the president controls that. I’m going to convert those government fleets into clean vehicles made of and sourced right here in the United States of America. I’m going to expand the capacity so the United States, not China leads the world in clean vehicle production.\\nJoe Biden: (29:17)\\nWe’re going to make it easier to America’s companies to switch from fuel inefficient vehicles. We’re going to build a network of 500,000 charging stations all across the country. Offer consumer rebates to swap old or fuel inefficient vehicles for new clean American made models. Together, this will mean according to the estimates, more than a million good new jobs in the American auto release, because we will own the electric vehicle market in the world.\\nJoe Biden: (29:48)\\nFolks I guarantee you, we can do this, but we have to come together. I remember you and I talking gov when I was running for the nomination in my same way to unite the country. You’re the only one whp thought I was right. That used to be the old days. Yeah, Joe, you got a lot done. You used to walk across to get a lot done, but everything’s changed. Well folks, if we can’t unite the country, we’re in trouble.\\nJoe Biden: (30:23)\\nAmerica and our system runs on consensus. Compromise is not a dirty word. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. I do not see American terms of red and blue. Bringing the country together, that’s the job of a president. It’s a duty to care. To care for everybody. We can be so much better than what we see.\\nJoe Biden: (31:04)\\nWe can be what you are at our best, when we’re the United States of America. Folks, you have to vote and people are turning out here in this state and overwhelming numbers around the country. If you have any doubt, go visit iwillvote.com/and-i. Early voting is happening now. Every city and township clerk’s office in the state. You can register to vote in one quick stop. You have your ballot already, mail it or drop it in a Dropbox today.\\nJoe Biden: (31:47)\\nDon’t wait, vote, and don’t just vote for me and Senator Harris and Gary as well. Vote all the way down the line. We’re going to need Gary back in the United States Senate, looking out for Michigan families because we’re going to win back the United States Senate. When we do, we’re going to change things. Folks, this time I really mean this to restore the soul of America. To rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class.\\nJoe Biden: (32:23)\\nThis time is I’d bring everybody along. Debbie, may remember my colleagues in the caucus used to wonder kid me because I quote President Kennedy. When he was about going to the moon and famous speech, everybody remembers the different parts of it. The line I remember more than anything else. He answered the question that wasn’t, it was implicitly being asked, “Why are you doing this?” He said, “Because we’d refused to postpone. I refuse to postpone the work America must do now to bring this country back.”\\nJoe Biden: (33:01)\\nThere’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to American future. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. No other country can do that. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Well, we have to let them know who we are. What we stand for, we choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. Folks thank you and may God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
